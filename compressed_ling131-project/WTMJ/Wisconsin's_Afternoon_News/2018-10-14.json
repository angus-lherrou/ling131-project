manipulation\nWhatever you think of them I tip my hat is brilliant\nIn the way that he does it\nWhen he came out after the confirmation any just both barrels against Christine Blasey Ford it was clear\nHe was trying to incite them into protesting and get it because they just vent it outside ways\nAnd it's very very affected [noise]\nPart as I mentioned it it's it's affected for him as I mentioned\nPeggy Noonan I has a role I consider if he's really that unless I Want to get started here will finish it up after the news\nVoices of reason and ... and Peggy Noonan today's Wall Street journal\nWhat did the cabinet controversy tell us about our historical moment it underscored what we already know that America is politically and culturally divided and that\nActivists and the two parties don't just disagree with each other but disliked and distrust each other I Would argue bordering on hating each other and public opinion surveys bear that out\nWe all sort of the Supreme Court has come to be seen not only as a constitutional and inevitably political body but it was a cultural body\nThat follows cultural Kearns moods assumptions it has frequently brush pass the concept of democratic modesty to make decisions that would most peacefully be left to the people at the ballot box after national debate\nSo citizens will experience of course as having\nGreat power over their lives and nominations to the court will inevitably draw passion and this was a fifth can serve it at the seat on a nine person court but\nThe cabinet hearings has some new elements there were no boundaries of inquiry mill vowing to the idea of a private self\nAccusations were made about the wording of captions under yearbook photos the Senate showed a decline in public standards of decorum as American number of senators no longer even pretend to have a class\nOr imitate fairness the screaming from the first seconds of the first hearings so coordinated interruptions be insistent rudeness and accusatory tones none of it looked like the workings of the order democracy that has been the envy of the world\nTo Republican senators this week wrote to me was the sound of morning one fondue amazing and terrified that seemingly but all very much thought nearly half the United States Senate has abandoned the presumption of innocence in this country all to achieve a political goal the other side of the truly disturbing result\nOne of the great political parties abandoning the constitutionally based traditions of due process and the presumption of innocence\nVery least Senate Democrats overplay their hand\nOn a stop there when we pick this up\nShe makes it clear that she has a bias in favor of sexual assault accusers\nAnd yet she was deeply troubled by what she saw\nHer Jeremy Jefferson the L C S's here WGM Jay live for Miller Park all day the Dodgers ... game on against the crew hall of famer Bob you're on the call all postseason lawn and our coverage starts tonight at six thirty five\nI Want to pick up where a at left off\nPeggy Noonan space\nWhat we learned about voices of reason and ... and and I think this tells the tale into ... what we heard this week from Democrats while we're now it's time to get down in the gutter and my argument is really only presentation ally\nNow there's ever been like Donald Trump and I'm not believe me I'm not pretending that there has been\nPoint is\nWe need to look at them more subtle\nVoices of on the reason that should concern us as well\nLeast Senate Democrats overplay their hand\nMy bias in cases of sexual abuse and the south and it is a bias she writes his in favor of the woman I give her words greater weight because I'm not in my personal experience seeing women lie about such allegations and I know the reasons they have in the past kept silent\nIf you know your biopsies and are serious you will try to be fair knocked over correct\nBut to maintain standards September sixteenth for David charges made by Christine Blasey Ford appeared in the Washington Post I was certain that more witnesses and more information will come forward we would see where justice lay\nThe great virtue of the hash tag me too movement is that the whole phenomenon has broken open by numbers and patterns numbers of victims patterns of behavior and the deep reporting that uncovered both in this case great reporter's tried to nail down ms forward story but they did not see\nThe New Yorker story that followed was dramatic but on persuasive a hand grenade who's paying cannot be pulled the final allegation of rape train parties insight punch was not in the least credible let me stop there\nGot even less credible with Michael Evan as presidents\nAnd most people recognize that she injecting himself into this was the biggest gift Republicans got [noise]\nShe goes on\nHe was news for a story that was compelling but in need of support or cooperation it did not come it was a woman who redeemed the situation Susan Collins senator from Maine and her remarks announcing her boat she showed a holy unusual respect for the American people and for the Senate itself but\nActually explaining her thinking others or\nDidn't did not think kindly of this but I go on under intense pressure her remarks were not about her emotions she weigh the evidence in contrast to say senator Cory Booker who attempted to derail the hearing from the start and\nAlong the way compared himself to Spartacus those Spartacus was a hero not a malignant the food ms Collins noted that she had voted in favor of justice is dominated by George W. Bush rock Obama and Donald Trump\nShe considers qualifications that party she reviewed ... having a twelve year judicial record including more than three hundred opinions features and law review articles she met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours and spoke with him again for an hour by phone with more questions\nShe judged him centrist in his views and well within the mainstream of judicial thought\nHe believes he told her the idea of precedent is not only a practice or tradition tenet rooted in the constitution\nAs dumb as Ford's charges since the confirmation process is not a trial the rules are more elastic but certain fundamentally legal principles of all due process the presumption of innocence in fairness do Baron my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nAnd we must always remember she wrote that it was when passions are most inflame the fairness is most in jeopardy\nWas Susan Collins Peggy Noonan rights she calls with a gang rape charge outlandish allegations of no credible evidence at this point it was understood the Democrats have gone too far it is believable said ms Collins than ms for is a survivor of sexual assault and that's the trauma has offended her life\nBut for witnesses she named ... operator account none have any recollection of the party her lifelong friend said under penalty of felony that she never remember such an event or even knows for Kavanaugh\nCollins said she's been alarmed and disturbed by those who suggested unless judge Kavanaugh's nomination was rejected the Senate but somehow be condoning sexual assault nothing could be further from the truth\nThe atmosphere surrounding the nomination has been politically charged to reach a fever pitch even before the forward and the other charges\nThat has been challenging to separate fact from fiction but his decision must be made judge Kavanaugh's record has been called one of the ... public servant judge teacher coach husband and father for hope this he will work [noise]\nUh that he worked to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we are far fewer five four decisions and so the public confidence in our judiciary and the highest court is restored and so she said she would vote to confirm it was a master class and with a friend called old style for on this combined with the feeling for justice\nOr word on the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic party\nFor Halloween and screeching that interrupted the hearings into voting for people who call them the door of the court the ones who chased senator ... screens at them in elevators who surrounded and harassed one at dinner with his wife\nWho disrupted and brought an air of chaos who attempted the thought never product processes so that the people could not listen they make\nSo they make their judgments you know how that sounded just normal people Republicans and Democrats another elated that sounded demonic\nIt didn't sound like the resistance or has taken me to it sounded like the shrinking in the back of an old audiotape of an extra ... democratic leaders should stand up to the screeners they happen because they're afraid that the the things

of those games to make sure that there will be more baseball play here at Miller Park or I guess technically they could win all three of those games to make sure that more baseball's played this year at Miller Park if you want joined the program you can do so on the ac unit mortgage talk it's excellent for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four\nSeven nine nine one six twenty you can also tweet into the program a map Pauli on air brewers extra innings being presented by associated bank let's get to the phone calls we'll start\nWith Justin in mosquito hey Justin you're on WGM Jay\nI last Saturday call then\nJeffries I was upset with him but what about\nAfter he got a place you go so far you can have all your story ... ... well I Can't say much for that what has happened\nYet just appreciate the phone call I'll be honest I was a little bit surprised when Jefferson came back out to they had walk him story op at that point a story or\nWas not as strong yesterday as you would have liked him to be and I think Jeremy Jefferson until he gave up the home run ball I think Jeremy jumpers his pitch perfectly fine there's been a lot of soft contact is found its way through you know the the ... that land out in the shell out build the ... the ground balls that just\nHas eyes and finds its way out that's what has been recently when Jefferson it's not like he's being hit hard that changed\nAnd it changed a very very quickly when Justin Turner hit the homerun there in the eighth inning and that was a very very hard hit a ball\nAnd I I'm not totally sure why you don't go to the story and the situation obviously ... council has all the trust in the world and German shepherds and I get why has but you look at the way the seventh inning went down even though it was somewhat soft contact even though he was able to\nGet out of it I did feel like going to the eighth inning was probably a good opportunity to bring in\nA new relief pitcher in didn't work out that way that being said ... of course has done a really nice job for this club\nI give up the home run though and that ends up being the biggest hit of the game back to the phones we got Andy in Milwaukee handier on WGM Jay\nHow are you\nStill got a call from Brian cocktail hour job you've got to know where that's at frustrated that come in and have a little a little petty during her up I'd go ahead oh I just all these people criticizing how the formula all year you don't go to retire after a while and wait in Miami was\nThere to get a hit so that lead off and on top of your while you're on your door to the bullpen and in the night before and all year but it wasn't there at night and that product how on earth and the other guy's not making\nAny I think you're on your point and I appreciate the phone call let's go to law school at different dimension topping the delorean and how things go down a little bit differently let's say wait Miley comes back out for the sixth inning he gives up the hit to Chris Taylor\nAnd they let him stay in the game and then just in turn or as he did in the eighth inning hit the homerun off avoid Miley there and the six isn't the narrative isn't the conversation right now on this show all year long\nThe way the brewers have won over the twelve game winning streak the way the brewers have one is by making sure that even though stars the national out dinners never go through in order the third time through isn't there a ton of criticism on credit counseling for that\nSo he's allowed to face the top of the order of third time through he immediately gives up and I'm Talking about Wade Miley\nImmediately gives up of Basij Chris Taylor\nAnd they go to the bullpen because the third time through the order they have numbers they have advanced analytics that basically saying it's not even that advances pretty simple stuff\nThey have numbers that indicate\nThat when they starting pitcher faces a line up for the third time through the effectiveness of that starting pitcher drops exponentially so they gave me the opportunity to go through a third time and the moment he faces the batter for the third time for the first time that makes sense\nFor sale or get to base it and that was the end of the day they were using the exact same plan that they have used all season long to or not all season long but especially here recently over the so winning streak\nThe exact same plan that they used to be able to get wins it just didn't work as well tonight let's go to a Mike cars on the carpet and Mike you're on WGM Jay\nHow're you doing back after ... after ...\nUm agree with the previous caller and you're on quite a with what's going on your ears are going to hate but um I think it's all part of the plan I think you know splitting at homeless is\nLogical the two best teams are going to go fifty fifty on games\nOf the best teams in the world is going to lose one one out of every three so I was a big deal is I I was happy with it for for farmers today it just didn't work out to think that we're going to sweep the Dodgers is ludicrous I think we just when one game in LA\nAnd come back and and like counselor said all year long we just want an opportunity to win and have two games at home\nGame six and seven with a chance to where I think there is nothing more perfect than that\nYeah Mike that's a really ... and take by you and I appreciate it and look the steam just one twelve games in a row\nIf they let's say there's a scenario where they go to LA and they lose two or three and they come back down three two and a series\nOf course there are quick to be able to win too in a row of bacteria Miller parking game six and seven so everything is absolutely fine with this team for one for seven nine nine one

Jeremy Jeffress or the Dodgers all parents arrived late they arrived late to the party they're able to get a win today\nThere's going to be more games like this during the theories these games are are just too close so I figured out what level\nI'm ... I'm I'm dealing with that you just heard that call that we talk I'm I'm Amazed at the brewers have used the exact same template to win twelve games in a row and to end up having the best record in the intent tire National League and two sweeps through the national league divisional series\nAnd then they use that template today\nThey end up losing the game and you would think that some enter a manager who was called up from double lay which was managing the brewers if you're if you're listening to our phone calls in our tax dollars it's it's amazing to me how much how how upset people are that weight Miley came out for the exact same reason\nThat every starting pitcher has come out recently for the\nYou know it it followed the script of recent games of recent wins and unfortunately it just if you do pretty good relievers all star in a rising star\nWars able to get it done today and that's unfortunate and you're talking about a late rally by the Dodgers and I think the bigger aspect of this game is you know the bullpen falters then it becomes headline news but how about over five with runners and scoring position not getting a runner past second half the fifth inning\nThat was a problem you know you're seeing Dodgers relievers for the second time LA's able to get to the brewers bullpen but the bird was wonderful to get to Los Angeles has pulled that at all today\nMaybe the bulk of their work off putting curse all yesterday so that was a little disappointed to see you had a kind of tailor made with a ... position and you're MVP up at the plate you thought able to get it done but was came strikes out at a pretty big one scoring opportunity\nThere and the nights and it was a missed opportunity and no real significant\nRally for the brewers today a couple of solo home runs and those are nice and help build the three nothing lead but all federally there were very quiet\nTo your point yesterday when they won that game by one run they got an ad on Ron light with the suicide you are someone they don't get the ad on runs today and that that's the difference yeah and this is a team if you want to find one of the flaws of the teams have this year it is getting out on\nRuns getting out to an early lead and not finding a way to tack on to that lead and that issue comes back to bite him today because it that's a way bigger issue to me if you want to admit pickup outweighed Miley being pulled up for five and two thirds instead of going six and two thirds or seven\nFine I did that without the whole point of the story here all federally the brewers have been challenged the going back to the series against the Rockies with letters in scoring position\nI kind of stuff to the Rockies next to that game three and had some tack on the roads are really put out of reach but for the first two games of that series if there was an issue they were they were not scoring on this uh run scoring opportunities they were not deliver it great great stuff I I Know you're headed out to LA up next we'll be talking to you from out\nThere I Am I look forward to it all mailed back in and out burger or the ... for you know hopefully we're talking about some ... when

funny when the brewers are up by a three nothing score here in the Miller Park across Fox ah Greg math to Doug Russell high we all sit next to each other and the press box\nAnd the Dodgers got an absolutely nothing going and I remember looking at Greg insane man it feels like the brewers are up by a lot more than three runs and it wasn't much a longer after that left the Dodgers got a couple of runs a board in the seventh inning\nAnd I looked at him and I said it doesn't even feel like it's a three run lead now that's the playoffs that's the post season so much can change\nAt any given moment and that's why the baseball postseason is amazing and brewers fans I I Do appreciate the fact that you're passionate about this team and his last means so much this last hurts I've never said this law doesn't hurt this was a game that the brewers absolutely could have one and they ended up not winning and\nThe brewers extra innings we're live at Miller Park for one for seven nine nine one six twenty the academic organ stock index line I say all that to bring in Fox Sports Wisconsin analyst Jerry Augustine and Augie ah let's start with Jeremy ... because he does give up the home run to Justin Turner clearly that's a hard hit ball\nI he does issue of bases loaded walk to a light hitting Austin Barnes in the seventh inning I think it's completely vowed to take issue with the home run to take issue with the bases loaded walk but\nHe has struggled recently but I struggled in an area where he's been really unlucky there's been a lot of sauce contact that found its way through as a as a former pitcher in somebody who is devoted your life to to this game Augie\nHow do you evaluate a pitcher when they saw contact but the results aren't there\nBut when I when I look at Germany I was really a good understanding of what you have to\nSay that all you got to adjust to that and sometimes you can make a judgment but you're still on what you have in the African American\nI think if you are in jeopardy right there is the one that has caused some issues it's pitch and behind and when you could be higher than it is especially in the postseason it ... it just comes it's delivered it becomes a high level at your age\nAnd they could get a better job and that's what it what I have a good picture here is a\nBarrier that he did it for their first year and and then he laid there you got to hurry\nUp and put her down and it ended up with a guy yesterday left the ... of all over the middle part and they they were able to get some ... but I think when you when you're out in the garden or do you think about one thing I Am going to say that I met so scarred\nAnd our ... man that gets my pictures and and I think that's a full of all the way sort of all it's about that is going to be ... and it's difficult because you have to make too many Richard when you put\nIt was a lot of fun to watch weighed Miley do what he did today in Boston the loss you know everybody wants to argue about whether or not my we should have come out of the game or not and again I mean people were going to have that argument whether or not we talk about it but the bottom line is five and two thirds innings two hits three strike outs know walks water performance when Miley\nOr he just the boss so in order that confidence when you talk to him or it shouldn't have in Africa talkative and is that Eric ... says he understands what he has done and that he what he needs to be successful\nI I really appreciate what he has done this by coming out after he came back from the second grade\nAnd started with that cut fastball really commanders stripes or with the cut fastball but what is done in the last three or four hours is really added that fast in the up and you look at a strike or today the first one was on it in the last two or on a on good ... all\nThat if you're on the other place do you look at what we're married early ballots where there's pictures is tremendous stripes on you all his picture and you know what you're looking at one category as a category I looked at every year every outing ... categories of up there\nAnd that what you do if they're going to reach you got a really good at their job\nWhat do you what do you think happened was carbon burns they're beginning to seventh anywhere he goes walk kid hit more coming out\nWhen you get to the post and everything becomes so much greater ... you multiply it so that any more time in the end of season it when you get into that that good concentration about going out and really understand it that you know what I Do\nIs I have to fix it and I have to do it I betcha commanders rights are\nI think what happened is that the er Internet first walk them\nAnd I think it's the mindset\nI think he started to overthrow because there next to there is a fat\nLike that I had to go there to guide macabre gotta get there first thought\nIn the middle ... got to base it back up the middle and then you put it in fact they really get in get they get perspective and cried over there it is and really made the pictures of it in the middle of\nThis or that or in his last\nFor seven dollars off is really crush on the inside of the play\nIt can ... very well and he had that great break the ball on ... or ... even if you're a very good for that it's done it's orange there where he got to walk down the guy with without a lot of ... what are the ... or by the over ... states have\nSo much focus on the pitching but birds go for five with runners in scoring position they lose a one run game I I think it's a much more valid thing to be maybe a little bit frustrated that they weren't able to tack on some runs after they get the initial for runs\nYeah you know when it is that there are three runs in the army\nYeah I agree with you there\nAre I think ordinance at a series that we all know that it's used in the middle of that line of February and the ... in the law\nAnd the and the doctors those are going to keep that needed to come up with the kids that it all the right to any of those struggles in the in the in the series against Colorado you use color come out and you know\nA reality but it's going to be those guys\nThat come up with guys on the circuit for you to wall and it still is I just want it goes right in a\nSavage jar and the fact that they're talking about ... ... ... out in the order is that it created a lot of\nA good thing for it but then it'll probably learn if you look at where we had ... that are really at that middle part of your ... I think that's going to be going in the LA they're getting those guys look back on it it looked like a couple of guys are paid and having them about ... ... yeah\nYeah absolutely our dog your grades suffer resent you chime in and we'll talk to you here and a couple of days for a good number three\nBayer tied at one way to go to if he really he really match they showed it the first two games are going to have some fun with\nAbsolutely sounds good there's Jerry Augustine joining us from Fox Sports Wisconsin for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that's the academic work it's shocking tech signed a ton of callers waiting on hold let's get to another we've got breath in Milwaukee ... you're on WGM J.\nYou kind of take the same solace knowing that you've seen a lot of these guys and they've had to burn through this many guys or two games [noise]\nYeah I mean I mean I think making their bullpen and work as you know something you want to do\nBut I don't ... none of us have the right answer is a good that you face the guys are good that you're making them more you know in the end of\nThat stuff comes down to the players got to go out there and in battle each other um non\nAnd that's that's going to be the game so\n[noise] um\nYou know they I'm not out is to use a bunch of guys today and then I think both teams are getting like it's it's in a series like this all seems are getting looks at sets the other things ... and that's that's how it works\nTo more upper right Greg gotta practice but said yesterday that you know he's coming especially in another close game like this and wasn't going to be easy series is all things considered one one of the second phase of this is this kind of the series that you expect is so far\nI mean not that it's [noise]\nI I don't know if you can't get any closer after two games right\nUm ... it's been too hard fought games um to one run games um you know time run on base and scoring physicians finish each game\nSo\nThey've been about as close as they can be um so we're we're looking forward to the next chapter\nMagical counsel with the media just a little bit of go for one for seven nine nine one six twenty the academic more good stock index line Travis ... given a sky Travis George W T object\nHey Matt how're you doing I'm good\nYeah great show listen I'm a you know I've said all year Craig and Craig council we trust I think he's\nBeen the manager of the year and the national league by far but in the postseason there's nothing wrong with saying you know what maybe he made a couple of mistakes with its pitching staff the last couple of days\nMaybe he's pulled guys too early maybe he's going to burn is bullpen out too early\nMay be a guy like carbon burns a rookie who yeah eastern lights out but you know what game to the animals the yeah it's a different story than pitching in June or July ... it it it's a it's a big moment for him and came up he ... he didn't get it done\nSo maybe by tonight I'm not I'm not not he he probably pull ... out too soon did I I think he could have gone another inning and a third which would have been great but you still would have got to Jeffress who I think is looking a little bird do right now could able OKC enables okay but\nYou know what he did last night pulling out gee open dollars too soon pulling out obviously branded worker who was money last night too soon burning up his guy Haider Haider is his guy he was not available tonight 'cause he broke them up last night they almost lost last night\nThey all I'd love cream cone Craig cultural he's done an awesome job this year but he made a couple of mistakes\nIn the postseason last tonight there's nothing wrong with than that\nI mean some of the law and and I think you're taking a really reasoned approach and I appreciate we can we can agree to disagree and I got no this is a fun debate for me I I so I appreciate the way you're coming at me on this um let me play devil's advocate with you\nLet's say a weight Molly would have been allowed to stay in the sixth inning\nAnd not face to face Justin Turner and Justin Turner hits a home run\nAnd then after that David Breeze comes up to the plate and freeze hits a home run and you are completely familiar with the information that analytically there's a exponentially greater shots of the hitter having success against the pitcher a third time through or how would you be feeling about the decision at that point\nI probably I'd probably be calling you up saying oh you should have pulled them out early [laughter]\nBut I'll just say that's one one of the things I I don't like about the new wave at baseball is being run\nAnalytics and numbers and everything from her and a manager a good manager especially a manager that is good in the postseason kind of goes with his guts and says you know what I Know the numbers say this I Know the numbers say that but this guy's been awesome he's given up to ...\nAnd five and two thirds I'm ... I'm going to see what I'm gonna run with this guy I'm going to go with the hot arm and I'm gonna stick with this guy you know I mean\nThat's ... that's one that won World Series for managers in the path it'll hurt a lot of history in this game and you know you sometimes managers they got it it it's not all numbers if not all number\nI appreciate the phone call I got to let you go to interest\nI disagree I ... I guess it's not so much they disagree it's what I think the team's DNA I think this team became\nThe best team in the national league\nBy playing the game a certain way\nAnd I think they swept through the Rockies and I think they won the first game against the Dodgers playing the game a certain way and I want to see them to continue to do that now this is there are teams out there look at the Houston Astros and their starting pitching their teams that are going to rely on starting pitchers should go deeper into the game if if Justin burly undergoes five innings tomorrow\nAnd gives up to ... not tomorrow I guess he's pitching today as we speak it just really understood after five innings given up just to hit them say what the world is going on in Houston windy out of that game\nBut it's that the team is different they play the game a different way and it's not the way that they're built tonight that's the big difference for me but it's a it's a fun conversation to have and I appreciate the call who goes to the game with the highlights that next its members extra innings on WGM jak\nHarder funeral home we see our community as our extended family\nAnd that's why we worked so hard to invest in our community and the families that call at home\nAnd order a funeral home you will find our services or ... or whatever they\nWere grateful to serve and be a part of a community where family values truly matter\nHarder funeral home\nFamily owned and operated since Nineteen thirty four\nWelcome to her everyday health teacher sponsored by freighter in the Medical College in Wisconsin if you'd be diagnosed with breast cancer or a loved one as you want to ... from the start\nThat how do you know you're choosing the right team with the right experience to treat your cancer Dr Thomas keeper a medical colleges that freedom in the middle college Wisconsin's wrestle town square health center is here to share his thought first of all Dr thanks for being with us today if someone who's been diagnosed with breast cancer\nIs their time to think about choosing your treatment team carefully\nSo anytime then somebody is diagnosed with cancer it really is a life changing event in most cases this was we were rescued\nReally important that you find the team the trust it can help you with your cancer drain\nWhy is personalized here are so important and how does it come into play in the area of breast cancer\nPersonalized chair for breast cancer is very important because no two breast cancers in no two people are exactly alike the hope would be that we can maximize the medical therapy surgery and radiation therapy options available in the void those therapies that are not going to provide a benefit\nDoctor I Know the clinical trials are on the board of cancer treatment plant breeder Medical College Wisconsin we talk a little bit about that more specifically\nWith cancer trails are very important because what we're trying to do this answer a question that we have and so we want to know if there was a barrel be there can be added to my providing meaningful benefit or if we can modify current\nTherapy so that we reduced risk or if we can avoid being and all of those things come together in the Medical College we have the ability to get input from all the different cancer specialty so that we can optimize research so that we can help move forward in the science and off for a new therapies which may not previously now they all know\nThat could be ripped thanks so much for being with us today to make an appointment for for more information call for one for you know five zero five zero five were learn more at ... dot com slash cancer\n[noise] brewers that journey presented by associate debate continues you're on WGM\nJay brewers ball to the Dodgers for three the final score let's go back through the game with the highlights him for the brewers weighed Miley giving the start here in June were you getting this dark or the Dodgers and the brewers ... in the top of the first inning with one out just during got to be the next ...
