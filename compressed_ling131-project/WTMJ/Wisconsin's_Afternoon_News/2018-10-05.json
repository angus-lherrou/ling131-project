to be an affirmative vote to move into full some tomorrow and as I said several key senators will make their decisions on tomorrow's on public\nAs early as we do this morning and this afternoon so we'll follow that votes as this moves forward the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh would take a quick break after the break rejoined town raw kind of digest what we're we'll be talking about for at least the last couple of weeks and also how these\nVotes today and tomorrow impact your upcoming midterm nationally\nAnd here in Wisconsin more next Roger WGM June I'm forty eight these pretty with you on this Friday a breaking news they have moved this vote to the final Senate tomorrow we'll send them finals and both Tom permission Brett Kavanaugh interesting details Murkowski was unknown and moving forward Collins\nWaking mansion mentioned the only Democrats voted yes and we're joined by calling Ross and joins me every Friday nine thirty five so your take on the Murkowski a\nNo vote at this stage of minutes I I Can't imagine she would shift in her in the voting for the full Senate tomorrow\n[noise] yeah we actually do have some some intriguing drama here it is interesting too if you were listening to the role mansion I think was the last\n... snuck his eyes vote in there right at the end and um\nSo it was he was up in the air there that it's really interesting this is always kind of come down to these four they can't lose they can't lose too and it looks like they May of last one is kind of hard to imagine that someone would vote no on cloture and that yes on the nomination but I guess it's possible\nIt's also possible that some are some of them are like Susan Collins is I guess it's going to announce her vote to this afternoon\nI could vote yes on culture and vote no on the nomination so odd things are things are tight we knew it was going to be tight a missile this'll add some intriguing drama to the next twenty four hours\nOn Rob joining me from the Wisconsin to Vermont liberty you mentioned it earlier the impact on the upcoming elections or it could go a couple of ways we've seen for most of the summer and so they're really small democratic enthusiasm rising now in the last couple of weeks Republican enthusiasm has been rising to match that\nWater what are we take away from if Kavanaugh is confirmed what that means for November\n[noise] yeah ... ... ... the ... event for the last couple of weeks\nUm they they are consequential but they feel consequential this is kind of a watershed moment I don't know if you saw some of the TV ratings for those hearings a couple of weeks ago they were huge and I was I wondered how this was going to play where people really going to tune into this or were they not and and it was huge and I think\nAgain I think a lot of people who had made up their minds were just had their minds made up further\nA boat it's going to be really really interesting to see how this\nUh this fight trickles down um I I think I think both sides are going to come out of this I'm mad and in the news and it's really going to be um if if the Republican needed a jumpstart I think this was it\nBut as we know I mean think back just a month or so to the things that we thought were consequential I'm not I'm is op ed in the New York times by supposedly a senior level official I mean what we know right now is that\nThat things that feel relevant and important in a moment a seemingly rarely stay that way so I think thirty some odd days seems like an eternity in this new cycle and political culture\nIt's kind of amazing that uh the more investigation has slipped quietly into the background and I was going to ask you a little bit later but I'll ask you know we're we're what what happens to that story line and this thing has been engulfed by the cabinet nominations\nAnd absolutely have and and there were rumblings over the summer that there is going to be some type of\nA report from ... that maybe this will be wrapped up in September obviously that has come and gone my guess is that nothing is likely going to happen or before the midterms\nAre but that's a whole 'nother dynamic that hasn't gone away there was this giant New York times story on President Trump and how we inherited wet his wealth and questions about taxes\nOr not maybe people don't care about that but I bet you if Democrats take the house of representatives they're going to care there's going to be committee hearings and investigations as so there's a lot of things occurring or that have been overshadowed by this this fight that are just going to be there right after the elections that are going to be there and the months and weeks ahead\nTone Rob joining me as he will every Friday nine thirty five I take a quick break again after you get back I Want to have you gauge the Wisconsin racing governor us send in for Steve rational district Colorado joining me on this Friday right here on WGN jak\nMostly on this Friday going to be more muscle tone Ross the final votes for some ... to move to the full Senate tomorrow fifty one forty nine\nWas Murkowski some of the surprise no votes on I Want to ask\nYou quickly about the races in Wisconsin what impact these might have it really just ... we'll start with the governor's race Uber's Walker\nYeah I mean the governor has been down hill tell you it's been down he's been saying that and trying to get every ah get his side riled up um get their side engaged and maybe this these hearings is enough to kind of get Republican voters engaged but he's got his own message\nI he's got his message vastly with Wisconsin that doesn't have to do with Washington DC and it it's it's a record to run on and it's something that I think he should be proud of and is proud of we have these amazing economic numbers of people start to take that stuff for granted we've seen enough in the past\nAnd uh it's interesting to see I think in the last two weeks or so you've seen a little bit of a change in his messaging because it would appear that his his messaging after the Democratic primary didn't really work that much is numbers went down and Tony ... went up so you're starting to see a message about taxes about the economy\nIs kind of message of we can't afford Tony ... it'll be very interesting come Wednesday when we get in Marquette policy of that it started to ...\nThis kind of message of we can't afford Tony ... it'll be very interesting come Wednesday when we get in Marquette policy of that it started to change the dynamic along with some of these other environmental factors like the cabinet hearing\nAnd US Senate booth near Tammy Baldwin a book there's hip Jimmy balls and hard US Senator Tim Walz won on health care and the ... center scandal what's semi balls as kryptonite if if there is any\nBut at the end of all that that comes down to votes and in the case of the of the a procedural vote today\nThe one surprise that I noticed was that Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voted no now doesn't mean definitely they should get a vote no on the confirmation it does suggest that that's where that will go to the vote was fifty one forty nine ah Joe Manchin the only Democrats\nFrom West Virginia and not a surprise given it's a very conservative state a Susan Collins was as a yes votes Jeff Flake was a yes vote now that doesn't pre determined to vote tomorrow\nBut I'm guessing and obviously things can change on a moment's notice if Mitch McConnell schedule those votes he's pretty sure he's got the fifty he need and they can lose one more\nBut I think he's in a good place and all I can change between today and tomorrow\nThere's also the senator Danes whose daughter's getting married you have to walk down the aisle and they have may have to if they don't have the votes may have to a shift the timing of that final vote so they can\nDo his duty as a father for his daughter enjoy the wedding and they get back to Washington DC for that final vote so that's part part of the story line as well I've said it for the last week or so I think the cabinet will be confirmed that's the beginning of a story\nWhile this has been a a drama like unlike we've ever seen before in this country this is the beginning of the story what's happening in Washington DC yesterday and today and will happen if Kavanaugh is confirmed Regina escalation of protests and escalation of anger\nOne party is going to lose their mind over this\nQuestion for all of us out here who observe these things will they lose their minds to the point where it doesn't just charge of their base but says the Republicans I don't like that behavior I don't like how Kevin I was treated\nI'm going to show up and vote November that shift some of this\nEnthusiasm gap in recent polls have has suggested it's closed quite a bit if ... if not completely to the Republicans saving\nSenate certainly and potentially even the house and there's about twenty three seats twenty four seats that have to shift in the house to change that from Republican control to democratic so there's a lot on the line here\nTomorrow's vote if it happens tomorrow if it happens Sunday will be the clothes for Brett Kavanaugh yeah your neck and I as I said I think he's going to be confirmed\nThat's not the end of the story this is going to continue to ramp up or the midterms will be the next target for Democrats the talking points are already out there if you watch any of the coverage on television or rent any the the op ed pieces\nHere's one FBI wasn't allowed to do their job first of all nobody tells you what to do if they see something they investigate the talk of the witnesses clearly in this case clearly\nWhich has been mishandled by Democrats from the from the moment they decided to out a woman who asked for confidentiality into all the actors are saying that can't be proven user commonsense and she was outed for a reason they wanted their Anita Hill moments\nThat's all this ever was about they didn't care about Christine Blasey Ford didn't care about how she was sacrificed in the cause of\nBlowing up the Supreme Court nomination of this president they didn't care about any of that stuff\nYou think Republicans out it or they didn't have the information to use your head\nUtilized common sense tells you where that story will go that's number two of our forests and the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee to stay in the world number three a fire department employee causing some controversy as it relates to the Milwaukee fire and police commission will tell you that story next regime W TMZ\nHands when he just needs to be with you on this Friday listening and always fifty two degrees at Radio City [noise]\nNumber three of our for I'd send you didn't want to see stories like this and I'm a guy that supports public safety\nProfessionals as much as you can publicly support him because I think they've ever done one of the toughest jobs in the planets\nAnd frankly to disrespect and to some people not I'm not everyone but some people show to them is unwarranted but this story bothered me so I wanted to sticking it to the fore at ten a former Milwaukee firefighter every coal Croft he was going to be Mayor Tom Barrett ... latest deployment to the to the fire and police commission well\nSome digging was done on average coal crop in some emails came up in one of these went after police\nAnd this was obtained by the journal son will be open records which is a good thing\nHe labeled Milwaukee police I'm reading from the journal sentinel article by Dan buys a poorly trained force of who abuses overtime are more interested in their wallets pension and benefits and protecting the public and cost the city millions on lawsuits over excessive force sexual abuse and killing people those are the words of every coal crop in an email obtained by the journal sentinel\nAlderman bookmark Murkowski would share vice chair of the public safety safety and health committee and was scheduled to vote on coal cross nomination said he was blown away by it\nAnd I think they postponed the vote I'm I'd have to get clarification on that but let me say this those are disqualifying comments you're going to be tasked with overseeing the leadership of the marking fire police departments\nThis kind of information this kind of vitriol directed at another group of public safety professionals suggest to me you're not ready for this job suggested that you bring with your application to this commission a bias that suggests you can't look at things objectively\nNow mayors pick these people based on their history and their experience and that's all great and you were if he was a former firefighter and that part's fine but when you read those kinds of comments suggest that something is not right here\nYou must make sure that anyone on the fire and police commissioner can look at things objectively using their experience to understand what what makes the most sense for these departments to make us safer to run officially\nAnd to move forward with out a lot of nonsense this as drama and nonsense to something that frankly doesn't need it doesn't need any more drama and nonsense and I would reject that nomination immediately be based on those comments\nHe wrote him I don't think he's denying them firefighter or nuts going after\nThe other big departments police department suggested that you're not ready to do the job for which you were appointed\nThat summer three of our forests and the four biggest stars as we see it costs Milwaukee to stay in the real number for the president in ... Minnesota last night\nOn the play some of that a rally the audio he also mentions Brett Kavanaugh and a little bit later in the ah ten o'clock hour on TALK about this new high rise proposed in Milwaukee interesting project\nI'm based on what it's how it's going to be constructed what it's made of at least the inside and a white could be something that breaks some really new ground in our city and then don't forget friday for him to different people from different walks of life\nToday Corey Peterson\nTracey Johnston two very smart women we're talking about all the current events of this week Kavanaugh the elections midterm elections coming out some of the other things swirling in our news cycle that's all coming up with the eleven o'clock or ... as we do every Friday night at the end of the show before we hit it off the Jeff Wagner was at Miller Park\nA little bit of a fund from yesterday's game one of the un LDS\nIn Milwaukee's way now you'll at least she says the Rockies back to Colorado enough games hall of fame or five years on the call once again and our coverage starts to forty this afternoon Jeff Wagner is live at Miller Park or will be live\nBeginning at noon right here in WGM Jay lots of excitement the festivities game to walk it jumps out in early one old leading the LDS I Will be out at Miller Park after the show today\nHope to say Hi to some folks out there catch a little bit of that game a lots of drama man baseball player baseball's regular season baseball is a tense\nCan be exciting can be a nerve wracking we saw that in game one yesterday I'm an Iraq the fourth time with the story yesterday\nCan be exciting can be a nerve wracking we saw that in game one yesterday I'm an Iraq before I ... with the story yesterday from yesterday president wasn't Minnesota rallying the base and he talked about the national story playing out in Washington DC today\nDo anything to hurt anyone to get the\nPower they showed desperately grain [noise]\nOh no you know what the words are they wanna raise this they wonder what they want to LA demolish they want to destroy that's [noise] that's what I just take a look at what's going on Democrats [noise]\nHappening try\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that was a rally in Rochester that you know Minnesota's pretty a traditionally democratic state but that was in Rochester an area that when heavy for president Donald Trump in the twenties sixteen election so he felt safe there\nI'm the president had a mixed week if you remember in Mississippi rally I think it was on Tuesday nights you went after to some degree Christine Blasey Ford's testimony and go after hurry when after testimony in and\nFace possible spouse and for their roles are reaction in the skin and that's it's not just funny as serious as well\nAh Hartford police officer Michael prints that I've I've read about things like this across the country is not happening in this area that I Know of he said I've been an officer for a long time whenever you think you've heard it all something like this comes up it's like wow\nUnfortunately for the young woman her quest for a homecoming queen title was unsuccessful didn't attend classes last friday and there's now barred\nFrom purchasing all homecoming ceremonies the end of the story even sadder she's now moved out of state since the incidents and said the police and the criminal charges will be pursued\nAs for those brownies that are remaining the police say the baked goods will be some of the crime lab for testing and analysis or no to homecoming\nQueen wannabes or homecoming king wannabes\nPots marijuana\nDon't put it in your brownies probably not a good idea you will be caught it might make it popular for a day or two but you might eventually be caught in this case for young woman had to move out of state and may be charged probably will be charged for her role in the pot escapade Hartford, Michigan\nComing up in the eleven o'clock hour because before at sand the four biggest stories\nAs we see it across Milwaukee the state in the world will be joined by Cory Peterson um she's been on the show before she's a researcher for the more uh Wisconsin It's to fill our liberties smart woman or she's going to join me Tracy Johnson\nFrequent guest speaker host I should say for when I'm off on a vacation or or assignments or they're going both joined me and what we have a lot to talk about today we're going to spend a considerable amount of time\nOn the cabin on hearing in the end they vote\nOr I thought to be interesting to have the perspective of two women talking about what that story means not just for Brett Kavanaugh but for the me too movement all the things that relate to that do women when I'm guessing the answer's yes the women think about this differently than then I'll get their responses on that do they think you'll be confirmed\nAs we move forward as I was giving you a some live testimony from uh the center for this a little bit early this morning fifty one forty nine and a procedural vote to move this forward now to the Senate tomorrow and it's down to these really these five senators\nAnd and no surprise us You're on who these people are 'cause they're frequently in the mix when it comes down to these cables Susan Collins Republican from Maine she was a yesterday will she'd be a U.S tomorrow Jeff Flake yesterday same question what is tomorrow hold for him Lisa Murkowski from Alaska she was a note today\nDoes that signal that she will be a note tomorrow Heidi Heitkamp is already a no North Dakota Democrat a lot of people think she just essentially ended her political career in a very conservative state and Joe Manchin\nOf West Virginia Democrat who I'm voting yesterday and the procedural votes will he maintained that\nYes affirmative vote in tomorrow's full Senate vote on the on the final confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh ... I'm reading the storylines swirling around this procedural vote and the there is tremendous amounts of uncertainty\nBecause you can't always make a correlation between these procedural votes in the final votes especially when you talk about a Supreme Court nominee and I'm a great point that's been made by a lot of people commenting on this is this is rare air\nMany of these votes are traditionally and historically landslides\nMany of the many of the recent Supreme Court nominees and you go back to the days of Ruth Bader Ginsburg three no votes\nNinety six yes this is a different time and I spent a lot of lot of the early part of the program talking about where we're at as a country what is what this all means I don't think we know ya but tomorrow's votes if it happens tomorrow will to kind of determine\nThat next phase which is between now and November's midterm elections gauging the response gauging what voters will take away\nWill they judge Republicans harshly based on affirmative vote for Brett Kavanaugh will they judged Democrats harshly for their treatment of Brett Kavanaugh and the forgotten figure and all this and I I predict this will happen Christine Blasey Ford\nHer name will be lost and there's\nNo one's gonna care about Christine Blasey Ford that's unfortunate a woman came forward I Believe she believes what she said but unfortunately she's going to be one of those relics of history a and again the vote will determine a lotta that storyline but for her her treatments lack of\nConfidentiality when it was requested those things are things that I think\nAny senator Republican or Democrat should look at going forward the news is next these could be with you on this Friday right here in WGM Jay and\nI'm In a way to the city with you on this Friday\nGame show an LDS coming up later this afternoon on WGM Jay Jeff Wagner is live from Miller Park\nBeginning at noon today of course every Friday eleven o'clock hour is the friday for them to different people from different walks of life today we're joined by Cory Peter since she's been on the show before writer researcher at the Wisconsin is for liberty good morning and night\nAnd Tracy Johnson CEO carjack view but also\nMy favorite filling halls [laughter] it was great to be here or there devil here so I Want to jump right into a gym and trace you been here before a car you haven't been part of the friday form before we're gonna talk about the events are happening across this country\nAnd this morning the Senate move forward a procedural vote to go to the full Senate tomorrow for a vote on the nomination of one that Brett Kavanaugh as the U.S Supreme Court I Want to get your thoughts about\nThis nomination at this time and kind of what it means to you want as a woman to as as a citizen the United states what does this nomination you\nWell I think Lindsey Graham said it while and the hearings um he call it the most ethical Sam I think he's exactly right\nUm I just don't think there is evidence they're just saying that I'm Kevin ... is for the abuser and not saying that forward this never happened before and that I something the evidence is there to say that it was half an hour is Tracy Weber Democrats you to a doctor for it it kind of gets red herring for\nI think the prospect of a sexual assault\nAnd I think that they were exposed for their inconsistencies and they're in sincerity to the real issue I mean even if I can find sinus morning when she was a a bladder and about ... why she wasn't going to vote for him which was hunting on his record\nI mean if this was supposed to be about sexual assault and this is what we really cared about why is this is is following all these different places and I think Trump is plane that's exactly right and the Republicans are playing this exactly right\nWhen they grab on today and encourage Republicans to get out and vote for conservative so that we can ensure there are fewer Democrats like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in those positions of power\nIf Kavanaugh gets confirmed that still up in the air and Lisa Murkowski peeled off today she is now no votes at least in that procedural side of this world and that's usually a pretty good indicator what will happen tomorrow\nHow does this change the dynamic in Washington DC we could have a another Supreme Court justices conservative\nWe've got to have a democratic group of senators and elected officials who are super irritated at what's happened to them they say well we also have Republican voters and elected officials who are on the opposite side what does this do if if Kavanaugh is confirmed ... how does the dynamic change starting as early as next week [noise]\nI think that they're the Republicans are going to be a you know fired up and justified in in their feelings because this was just such a disgrace to the process and they force this all to hey Kevin I wouldn't have been in a position [noise]\nIt's just such a disgrace to the process and they force this all to happen I I Am Kevin I wouldn't have been in a position to say that things he said to defend himself and to bring up all these\nThings are so irrelevant let's get back to an end at the end of the day Trump is going to tweak something and we're all going to be on that at some point you know it's a\nPassing thing right I completely agree and I think that um I think that this was this is a democratic hold us the whole point of this whole thing for Democrats\nWas to uh just find a way to smear him there's near their smear campaign did not work just as it did not work at all there is no evidence they weren't even able to bring it out\nBring out anybody else who had the testimony at the party there was there was no one else and so here we are with a story that has that has no backing um and yeah I think Republicans are definitely and the other right on that kind of looks good for them\nBut here's the other thing pulling now shows that people do people believe Dr for more than they believe\nJudge Kavanaugh and I think now the opportunity for Republicans is to explain that that that doesn't matter isn't about emotion or personal feelings here's the process we need evidence we would all want that if we were in that same position\nHere's what I don't get this was about women among US Senator Dianne Feinstein got to suffer mission in July sat on it as funny day it's twenty days of some points\nHer or someone that works with or somebody around her organization leaked confidential information would that Christine Blasey Ford wanted to keep confidential why does she not being called out for the\nWell I think I think Democrats have done is they've been able to um\nKind of ... kind of make this about when they make this a winning issue um their tactic has been to try and sell the idea that women are inherently believable\nNow you'll be that way but\nI I'm doubtful that he'll be he'll he'll be entirely that way although you have done a good job I think what the Kavanaugh he didn't have the Mississippi thing but during the hearing I think he was pretty quiet and he wasn't timing in too much there\nWell I think exactly the opposite of Korea I think his role is to get to every state where there is a represented a senator who was up for reelection who supported him rally them in that effort and if there is a candidate if there's a senator who voted against him I think he needs to think long and hard about who he supporting and how he's rolling that base\nWhich interesting thing about this president she won an election and twenty six you know a lot of people thought he was going to win maybe she didn't even think he was going to win but he did it in the way that you just mentioned\nShe went out there he talked to people in every state he needed to hello Hillary Clinton Wisconsin and a couple of other places didn't show up to to get her voters out there and showed up in our in our motel here\nI think the president understands what his role here and that's the gift to the states like you said it's\nRamped up base up Democrats could have it but that's how you win elections well\nAnd he's going to he I I Hope he comes to Wisconsin at some point he's not going to come to Milwaukee or Madison but you know go out to to ... northern Wisconsin and and get people excited and and get them out to vote because right now\nWe're we're struggling a little bit and even as it comes to the state elections we talk about the governor's race they were kind of a a lack of enthusiasm there for the Republicans and we need to get them out not just for\nA ... revoke mayor but Scott Walker and all of the Republicans and they simply and Senate\nAnd Corey I'll give you the last word under the president's role going for we mentioned a little bit but so he's going to be house now trying to energize the Republican base that that's frankly not been there in the last six months or so we've seen a huge ramp up by Democrats now Republicans need to charge the November can do it\nI I think you can I think you can do it and I think he should do it by trying to stick to topic like the economy um topics that are hard for Democrats to disagree with\n'em I mean everybody's experience the boom and the economy I think it I think everybody's fairly excited about that on and I think yes I think he should stick to non controversial topics I think we should kind of um lettuce Kavanaugh saying hopefully he'll get confirmed tomorrow we can just let us fail on through but I think he I think he's really focus on the economy\nIt's amazing that the news today forty nine year low on the unemployment rate barely scratched the surface of national media costs because it's all about what's happening in Washington DC we're Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's historic number almost five decades low you're treated like it doesn't matter it's not the president's credit that's the treasury part of is Corey Peterson Johnson more with a measurement a ship the education if this governor and education governor is Tony Evers writes all that and that's the friday for a\nOff his way out of his name was\nShot to shoot rather hopes the rock record Colorado's on severe housing\nEverybody agrees on the call once again and our coverage starts with\nTwo forty this afternoon you each machine pitching he did a great job earlier this week I think you'll do a great job as a game to an LDS Miller Park I Will be there after the show among the highest you\nCare if you see me wandering the the confines of Miller Park or around there right now we're in the friday for a tutor for people from different walks of life\n... Tracey Johnston education Wisconsin there's a lot of different opinions or you have to watch TV studios waivers on one side of Scott Walker Governor Scott Walker and the other what should we believe in education course\nWell I I think that education are the biggest thing that both sides are doing wrong is the funding I think a lot of what he said change of this plant where where to that point of diminishing marginal returns with the amount of money we throw at education\nAnd so I think a Walker increasing funding for education\nAnd then of course even the Democrats I I think both sides are wrong to do that I think what we need to be changing how we educate kids and so I I think it's essential ... I mean at that point they were they throw more and more money and nothing nothing changing the kids aren't getting aren't aren't being better educated a lot of it it's going to\nTeach her benefits um which certainly don't need to be expanded\nI'm Sorry I think we just need to address thing Scott Walker um either Republicans you care a lot more about I'm not just giving money to the schools that caring about what's actually happening in the schools and how the kids are being\nTaught is a great point because it it it was just this narrow focus on the amount of money to mhm devoted to education is in less so\nUm the actual basic tenets of education the the the math or science so it seems like we've lost track of that in this in this mission to expand the choices for kids maybe it's not so much of a choice maybe it's just look back to base\nWell and if you look at the numbers I mean we're absolutely right in the middle we are we're both candidates are touting the success in education which is\nProficient is ... we rank like twenty three and twenty second in every category in the nation and then let's just not look at the entire world here because we're like fifteenth place our education system\nIt needs some work and that has the opportunity I think for both candidates what are you going to do in this next term Governor Walker what are you going to do Tony ... you've had the ability to to do more ... and take advantage of that opportunity as far as if Scott Walker the education governor\nUm I think his messaging should be more about the job creation 'cause he's the shops governor and I don't think you can be all things to all people because you eat this this education battle is won that can't be one\nHas been as as Governor Walker been tough enough Antoni ... in this and that was a specific part of this race and education that's the guy in charge of the German public construction has he been tough enough on TALK until years\nI think he I think he had been married ... or he could stand to be tougher I think he also should be tough on the legislators I think that they're the ones making a law what laws well Tony Evers was an executive position he wasn't the lines of writing in passing laws\nI Want to go back to school choice I like him because I think what school choices actually showed us is that for we can get better education for less funding 'cause that's a lot of the charter schools a lot of the um the Milwaukee parental choice program has shown us that for fewer dollars in the classroom kids can improve their scores and do a lot better\nAnd get better test result right well and how great would it be if our school superintendent and our governor could work together to create the solution I mean this is a nonpartisan position that the the position of superintendents but it's so political and it's been so politicized I just think of of that world where\nYou could have both people working together to to create those outcomes for the kids right right\n... ... jobs in court to to some joining me on the friday foreign let's shift to the ... [noise] I don't care who was first explain to me how this thing is going to work how it's going to deal with our Wisconsin Windsor is how it's going to make sense for anybody who's of those people want a free ride from one sort of slow to another\nWell I think to answer a lot of those specific questions there there are some people at the city and that that that can that can answer that question so opening on November second we just had that that announcement or the other day and I and I've had the opportunity to meet those people we've taken a group of of our members I work with commercial realtors\nTo talk to Daryl Simpson who is is that the national consultants who was helping to implement this people like like Jeff Polanski damn Casanova at the city who who can answer those questions and uh\nConsultant who's helping to implement this people like like Jeff Polanski damn Casanova at the city who who can answer those questions and ah you know working with the real estate community the mayor came out just this week and said that real estate values have increased like twenty eight percent by them um\nI think the way that they came to those numbers ... ... I I don't exactly know what I Will say is that adds\nA if people are looking at locating downtown they are how close are we to the streetcar there is a demand for that and there is demand for for being around their permanent infrastructure and when it comes to extending to the arena or they talk about Miller Park or or other place that\nWe're trying to get that funding to to do that but you can't do that unless you've got that that core and that based merit knowledge instead it's it's not popular that is his first line and in every for each other and fun with it no you have to end in each year that's the thing is this cheer\nAnd I'm not saying that I think it was the best use of of of funding but it's it's what we had to do and I think we need to to adapt to it and we need to embrace it\nAll right Corey jumping on the hobbit anytime soon\nI I'm really not a fan of the hops event certain part of it it just the fact that it's two and a half miles of track and that's not from one end to the other either like it's like a little spider ... branch is kind of coming out of that and it doesn't go to any of the you know it makes sense if it went to like the university campuses and went to the park on if it went to like a search warrant to brief street things like that\nBut that's not what it is so it's not it's not going to be solving problems of like people driving while they're driving fairly you know from Brady third word or wherever they are going it's not going to be helping the college kids no cars get places and it doesn't go to the really the poor neighborhoods either so I kind of wondering what exactly is what kind of gap is trying to say oh\nWell I think we we need to so so I also lived downtown for Twenty years that I work right in the heart of the city\nTwenty years ago there were tumble we'd literally down every street in downtown Milwaukee after six PM now we have density which is what we want we have congestion which is what we wanted to people in the suburbs that are listening that don't understand they come and check it out it is it is a much more vibrant place to be and it feels much more like\nA a more metropolitan place and again the hottest controversial and it it's always going to be controversial but it is here so what are we going to do about it just to sit around and complain about it is that a realistic thing to expand\nIt makes you a real burden because or conservative who supports the hospital's not a lot of those people jumping around\nWell I didn't say I supported the word I said I Know it's here and how do we get our head around that and make the back to that 'cause I Can't recall the tracks right now\nYou know that we cannot be rich that's already employs Tracey Johnston court Peterson tutor for people from different walks of life after friday for him after the break what are you know that we don't know that's all coming up next Roger on WGM June\nThat was actually I watch party [noise] ah

ships by most\nWomen on the third\n[noise]\n\nAnd that was the moment in Wisconsin rules to their feet if you're at Miller Park you have to watch party I was at home and I got off my chair that's how cool it was\nIt was just so much anticipation to get to the playoffs right now the the incredible run the brewers of additives nine straight wins now into to beat the cubs nano central title in the big game on Monday to kind of move forward\nAnd now when you're in at the tension level rise is even more and all those fans at Miller Park I'm going to be out at the ballpark this afternoon trying to get a few tailgate parties started talks talked to some fans as well just to take in the atmosphere game chew now so I sheen pigeon\nThis looks pretty good game on down so just an incredible evening

Johnston\nJust spent a lot of time on the cabinet hearing we have two women\nAs gas I Want to ask them what they think about all these things\nAnd uh whether or not and we'll know a lot more by that time whether this will move for for a final vote tomorrow in the U.S Senate but I Want to get their take on that and some other big stories of races in Wisconsin whether or not there's a there is a enthusiasm ramping up by Republicans as a result of that a cabin on\nThose Kevin hearings will discuss that with them and eleven o'clock hour coastal yeah ten o'clock hour before at ten\nThe four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee state in the world more brewers forty of course\nKavanaugh story that's going to be big us but we hope to have some live coverage are beginning about nine thirty briefly on that the cloture votes that will move back down to a final vote in front of the U.S Senate those senators will make that decision probably as early as tomorrow\nOr the president was in Minnesota last night was some audio from at a\nRally he was commenting on the cabinet hearings and a word that the storyline is going well being that about ten thirty five at nine thirty five ton Ross we can get to the program it's going to join me were bring pounding on on Fridays now at nine thirty five just kind of some of the week for conservatives\nWhat's the big story lines are where we're going um use the guy that uh everybody's familiar with the WGM Jay smart guy\nWe're going to break down the stories of the week as we are going to wrap up a very uh news field tense\nIn some ways Salvatore weakest brewers ... as I used to take care of business in game one and I know seven could you pass the citizenship test\nNew study says only one third of Americans could do that and I and my show knows I put and we wonder why we're at where we're at\nPeople have no sense of history of the country they live in\nAnd how those two things matter when you're talking about current events and and surprise surprise we get to the current situation in our country would politics and culture in a\nBid shouldn't be surprising given that we don't know our history at all\nBut we're going to spend some time in the next few minutes talking about the the cabinet nomination I'm actually after the break I'm going to read from an op ed that justice Brett Kavanaugh red or wrote yesterday\nIn the wall Street Journal and there was a response to all those things in a rural since his testimony last Thursday\nAt that hearing Christie buggy Ford testify first and then ... Kevin I responded and of course the treatments and the coverage of that uh the testimony was one that suggested he was\nUnable to control his emotions\nYeah anger\nAnd I'll ask the simple question no I Will read it stems from his op ed last a simple question what would you do in a similar situation\nIf your family your children\nYourself and your career\nWere threatened would you not react the way Brett Kavanaugh reacted I think\nA lot of us for a lot of us the answer would be yes\nBut I'm an arena extensively from his op ed in the wall Street Journal that was published yesterday just got to give us a sense of where Brett Kavanaugh is in this debate now\nRoughly a week away from his testimony the second round the testimony in the Supreme Court nomination process and now the Senate poised today to move that vote to a final vote tomorrow in front of this for US Senate\nWill know a lot more of this morning on where the storyline goes more next right here GM's you're\nOne of those breakthrough or twenty agent highlights ... regular season now we are\nCourse in the postseason big win last night game one an LBS thanks for the folks who came down to our watch party at Turner hall have one meeting all those folks incredible crowd at Miller Park I'm going to be out there this afternoon I haven't been to a playoff game um\nFor the more the brewers are all the other opportunities that they've had I haven't been able to go and today I Will be out there for the first time I cannot wait to be on a number of park with all the fans\nLooking forward to that they said there was a lot of brewers throughout the show today um some highlights a kind of a compilation of all the great audio we heard yesterday on our airwaves and other places related to their big winner where the uh\nThe visiting team at the Miller Park or the Rockies or they played well they came back in the night feeling I it didn't look good the Jeffries was struggling and are somehow they got it done the uh the bullpen game that strategy a\nJeopardy rush and say that's a Jeffries Jeffress um the um the bullpen committee game seemed to work well and I I was listening about Uber's broadcast news talking about that is that the future face of baseball you won't be starting pitchers relief pitchers will just be pitchers and uh you know\nBroadcasting he was talking about that is that the future face of baseball they won't be starting pitchers relief pitchers they'll just be pitchers\nAnd uh you know we've seen the the amount of time that the pitchers pets used to be guys have complete games there used to be I used to be a big fat and baseball and the ... is slowly got whittled away now five innings gets you to when we see less and less of that every year so baseball's changing\nThankfully this year it's changing in a good way for the Milwaukee franchise so lots of excitement here in Milwaukee will bring a lot of that to you today on WGM they also just a a show now he's a broadcasting legit and I'm off the treasure he's Mr baseball Bobby ... he joins Jeff Wagner\nLater today at twelve tend to talk about the brewers in the playoffs Jeff a\nHe's a he's not just a broadcaster Jeff loves his Milwaukee Brewers season ticket holder and he had to be excited about that game yesterday as well I Want to shift gear to politics today is is one of the big days than the U.S Senate\nThe or the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is down to a few senators now as many or as little as five I should say uh I just I just saw this on Twitter Ben Sasse says he will no votes\nTo confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh so that's a yes votes and there's a few other Joe Manchin says he will decide at nine thirty are turned ten thirty Washington D. C. D. C. time when he comes into the chamber\nA there's a few others as well Murkowski Senator Murkowski from Alaska Senator Collins and that's really where it lives\nWere they swayed by this additional FBI investigation or the seventh of Brett Kavanaugh as I told you last week none of the charade of comments\nThat were made last week about giving the FBI a chance to do additional work to that this candidate ... are going to make any difference to Democrats are the only Democrat that potentially could vote for Brett Kavanaugh is Joe mansion and that's because it's actually has to politically\nDoesn't mean it's going to vote yes but the end his state's of West Virginia a no vote on Kavanaugh would probably mean the end of his career and ah I saw that a\nCenter to hike camp or recently said you as as recently as yesterday that she wasn't no vote and that was another one of those states that uh could shift as well so lots of tension in Washington DC I wanted to read from you it's it's\nProbably one of those unconventional things that a Supreme Court nominee has ever done I think it's unique to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd as as those of us who watched the testimony last week his response to Christie ... somebody was unique and unconventional\nHe was emotional cried at times shouted at times called out\nThe Democratic senators on that Judiciary Committee and I said that and I say no I had no problem with the way reacted what would you do with your family your self your children your career were threatened in the manner that he was threatened\nNow we can argue and we do back and forth about if you went too far well he addressed\nThat in in an op ed that he wrote for the wall Street Journal last night and I read some of it and then after the break up the phone lines as well yeah I can ... for one for seven nine nine one six twenty do you think he will be confirmed simple question\nAnd twelve percent of this poll believed Dwight Eisenhower commanded troops in the civil war\nThat's a a little bit shocking of course uh he was about a\nAlmost a hundred years later not quite but uh [noise] so civil war Eighteen sixties World War Nineteen forties so that's kind of the current state of affairs among people that take the test so if you break it down by age\nSixty five or older Seventy four percent answered at least six of the ten questions correctly it's not a bad results\nHere's the part that's scary Nineteen percent so that thirty three percent that ultimately pass this skewed by the higher number among seniors only Nineteen percent\nOf respondents aged forty five or under pass the exam ... less than one in five could pass a citizenship tests that people want to be citizens of the United states have to pass\nA thousand people they asked us\nThese questions of\nWithin the margin of error of plus or minus three percent so what I'm thinking\nAbout these kinds of stories relating it back to what's happening now reliving it forward to what's happening now is should say\nDoes this surprise you that people react in the way they do those types of history not knowing that Thirty years ago Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hyper partisan\nOpenly advocated abortion for abortion rights and women's rights\nThe vote in her Senate confirmation was Ninety six to three\nBecause we I think we had an at the time of population that's still understood the importance of history and how the process should really work and I made this claim yesterday and I I feel strongly strongly about it today is I give them\nThis isn't about Brecht cabinet\nHe's just a guy that's in that position\nIt could have been one of twenty five other people who ever would have been put forward by this president whoever was on his list as a conservative justice similar activities similar charges would have been drummed up now it's been a lot of\nTime of yesterday's show talking about this timeline and the facts of this story the fact that a woman came forward Christine Blasey Ford and was outed by either a democratic senator or their staff clearly that's the case\nThe fact that they they waited because they have this information in July until two weeks ago to present this information to the other senators in the Judiciary Committee\nKnowing full well what what do the process to try to blow it up what do we see happening now as this process seems to have been moved forward I haven't got to the FBI part of it yeah\nMass protests\nAgain not about Brett Kavanaugh about this president's being allowed to pick a justice for the Supreme Court that's what this is about\nAll the other stuff window dressing unfortunately two people justice Brett Kavanaugh Christine Blasey Ford they get trash in the process but it would have been to other people\nBecause that's what Democrats wanted to do here\nAnd you could say I'm hyper partisan and I'm not being fair to the Democrats those are the facts elections\nHave consequences if Hillary Clinton or presidents she would have selected that very liberal justice for the U.S Supreme Court's\n\nThat's shouldn't shock anybody shouldn't surprise you\nThat's the reality\nSo don't be surprised about what's happening in Washington DC and the senators at least those voting in favor of Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be intimidated by thugs\n\nAnd threatened and threats from people who really have no knowledge of history no understanding of that's not how this process should work it's been taken over by a few networks\nAnd a few writers who want to characterize this process this way but that's not how it's supposed to work\nThe simple fact is the FBI did its job they've added the candidates Democrats didn't like it they complain about the process to complain about the votes to complain about the justice nothing is going to change that\nElections have consequences this president picked a conservative justice that's the reality we'll find out a lot today and early tomorrow on where the story goes but as I sit here right now\nIt seems more and more likely that justice Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed by the U.S Senate the vote will be close no doubt\n\nAfter the break I Want to have a little bit of more of a polarization where the country's going I just talked about citizenship and the testing it shows we don't know most people don't know what they're talking about when it comes to politics or our country's history is it any surprise that we'd get what we get the treaty with you on this Friday right here in WGM J what do\nOne degrees at Radio City I just gave me the results of a citizen citizenship tests\nDone by the winter will some national fellowship foundation also talking about polarization ice was on my race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenators voting in the affirmative Alexander harassed so blind those men Burr\nCassidy Collins Corker\nCorn and hot and\nCruz staying in the\nEarth's Fisher flake Gardner grand\nGrassley hatch Heller toes and tight Smith in Hamas\nIsaac's and Kennedy Kyle\nLink first McConnell Moran Paul Purdue Portland rich\nRounds Rubio\nSat Scott\nSullivan saying\nTell us Kenny\nQuicker and John\nMansion on\nSenators voting and the negative Baldwin Bennett\nBrown that's the current vote a procedural vote to move this is the full Senate confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh will just waiting the results that sounds like there's going to be an affirmative vote to move into a full some tomorrow\nAnd as I said several key senators will make their decisions on tomorrow's on public\nAs early as we do this morning and and this afternoon so we'll follow that votes as this moves for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh will take a quick break after the break rejoined counter off the kind of digest what we're we'll be talking about for at least the last couple of weeks and also how these\nVotes today and tomorrow impact the upcoming midterm nationally and here in Wisconsin more next we're going to be the engine\nNine forty these pretty with you on this Friday a breaking news they have moved this votes to the final Senate tomorrow's final Senate both confirmation Brett Kavanaugh interesting details Murkowski was unknown and moving forward Collins sway\nMansion mentioned the only Democrats voted yes rejoined by common rock joins me every Friday nine thirty five so your take on the Murkowski a no vote at this stage of is I I Can't imagine she would shift in her in the voting for the full Senate tomorrow\n[noise] yeah we actually do have some some intriguing drama here it it it was interesting too if you were listening to the role mansion I think was the last\nEight snuck his eyes vote in there right at the end and um so it was it was up in the air there\nThat it's really interesting this is always kind of come down to these four they can't lose they can't lose too and it looks like they May of last one is kind of hard to imagine that someone who vote no on cloture and that gas on the nomination but I guess it's possible\nIt's also possible that some are some of them are like Susan Collins is I guess it's going to announce her vote this afternoon\nI could vote yes on culture and vote no on the nomination so odd things are things are tight we knew it was going to be tight a missile this will add some intriguing drama to the next twenty four hours\nOn Rob joining me from the Wisconsin used to for long liberty you mentioned it earlier the impact on the upcoming elections or it could go a couple of ways we've seen for most of the summer and so they're really small democratic enthusiasm rising now in the last couple of weeks Republican enthusiasm has been rising to match that\nWhat what are we take away from if Kavanaugh is confirmed what that means for November\n[noise] yeah they ... the ... event for the last couple of weeks\nUm they they are consequential but they feel consequential this was kind of a watershed moment I don't know if you saw some of the TV ratings for those hearings a couple of weeks ago they were huge and I was I wondered how this was going to play where people are really going to tune into this or were they not and and it was huge and I think\nAgain I think a lot of people who had made up their minds were just had their minds made up further a\nBoat it's going to be really really interesting to see how this\nUh this fight trickles down um I I think I think both sides are going to come out of this a mad and in the news and it's really going to be um if if the Republican needed a jump start I think this was it\nBut as we know I mean think back just a month or so to the things that we thought were consequential I'd anonymous op ed in the New York times by supposedly a senior level official I mean what we know right now is that\nThat things that feel relevant and important in the moment a seemingly rarely stay that way so I think\nThirty some odd days seems like an eternity in this news cycle and political culture\nIt's kind of amazing that the the more investigation has slipped quietly in the background and I was going to ask you a little bit later but I'll ask you know we weren't what what happens to that story line at this thing has been engulfed by the cabinet nominations\nIt absolutely has been and there were rumblings over the summer that there is going\nThis is the story line and this thing has been engulfed by the cabinet nomination\nIt absolutely has been and there were rumblings over the summer that there is going to be some type of\nA report from Muller that maybe this will be wrapped up in September obviously that has come and gone my guess is that nothing is likely going to happen or before the midterms\nAre but that's a whole 'nother dynamic that hasn't gone away there was this giant New York times story on President Trump and how we inherited ... his wealth and questions about taxes are now maybe people don't care about that but I bet you have Democrats take the house of representatives they're going to care there's gonna be committee hearings and investigations\nAre so there's a lot of things occurring or that have been overshadowed by the ... the fight that are just going to be there right after the elections that are going to be there in the months and weeks ahead\nTone Rob joining me as you will every Friday at nine thirty five and pick a quick break again after you get back I'm going to have you gauge the Wisconsin rations governor us sending first congressional district Colorado joining me on this Friday right here on WGM ...\nWants to be with you on this Friday got a few more minutes with common Ross the final vote for ... to move to the full Senate tomorrow fifty one forty nine\nOr was Murkowski kind of a surprise no votes tone I Want to ask you quickly about the races in Wisconsin what impact these might have a religious gauge to save the rations will start with the governor's race Uber's Walker [noise]\nYeah I mean the governor has been down he'll tell you always been down he's been saying that and trying to get every ah get his side riled up um get their side engaged and maybe this these hearings is enough to kind of get Republican voters engaged but he's got his own message\nI he's got his message that has to do with Wisconsin that doesn't have to do with Washington DC and it it's it's a record to run on and it's something that I think he should be proud of and is proud that we have these amazing economic numbers are the people start to take that stuff for granted a we've seen enough in the past\nAnd uh it's interesting to see I think in the last two weeks or so you've seen a little bit of a change in his messaging because it would appear that his his messaging after the Democrat primary didn't really work that much numbers went down and Tony ... went up so you're starting to see a message about taxes about the economy\nIs kind of message of we can't afford Tony ... it'll be very interesting come Wednesday when we get a markup policy of that it started to change the dynamic along with some of these other environmental factors like the cabin on hearing\nAnd US Senate booth near Tammy Baldwin\nA book fairs hip Tim evolving hard US Senator Tim Walz won on health care and as a VA center scandal what's heavy balls a scripted I ... if there is any\nBoy it it it's been difficult it's been tough sledding I'm Tammy Baldwin is always kind of had a she's had a lead\n... going back a a long time and um it it's hard to say she seems to be in a in a different place where ah many of us thought that the ... scandal would be ineffective indictment ineffective I add there's this\nScandal has been around for twenty Thirteen I think Republicans have probably had four or five years to perfect the messaging on that but I actually thought came evolving to add\nThat featured this the the widow or the man who died in the home of the day was a pretty effective counter\nAnd so I think I think Republicans have to find a way to to show that this that this race as winnable\nAnd I think they got a track from national money they have to attract some national attention right now the traits is not on a lot of people's radars and that they're going to have to get people excited and maybe the cabinet thing is enough to get people excited it again I think this is one of the bigger things to the and the polls coming out\nIn the last last we've got about a minute left the first congressional district race against Brian style is this race\nI think so and and it is because of the environment um otherwise I think Brian style the walking away with this but I think just because of this is a tough environment\nUm I'll be I'll be very interested or the um it it it will be very interesting to see how how this race closes what what the attacks are going to be I mean ... for such a record been arrested nine times there's in many ways you and I have talked about their fish kind of know he has no business being a congressman but\nAh that rape that district is a close one and the environment of favors Democrats it's going to be really really interesting\nTown Rob to join me every Friday nine thirty five to talk to you have a good weekend great talent or off in the Wisconsin is to promote liberty boy there's plenty to talk about will continue to ah give you the latest on the cabinet as it moves forward to a final vote maybe as soon as tomorrow a couple of surprises in the voting but uh\nThat vote is not the same as the final confirmation vote which will happen maybe as soon as tomorrow the news this next regimen ...\nI'm going to show up and vote in November and could that shift some of this\nEnthusiasm gap in recent polls have suggested it's closed quite a bit of ... if not completely to the Republicans saving\nSenate certainly and potentially even the house and there's about twenty three seats twenty four seats that have to shift in the house to change that from Republican control to democratic so there's a lot on the line here\nTomorrow's vote if it happens tomorrow if it happens Sunday will be the clothes for Brett Kavanaugh yeah your neck\nAnd I as I said I think he's going to be confirmed that's not the end of the story this is going to continue to ramp up or the mid term will be the next target for Democrats the talking points are already out there if you watch any of the coverage on television or read any the the op ed pieces here's one FBI\nWasn't allowed to do their job first of all nobody tells you up you know what to do if they see something they investigate they talk to the witnesses clearly in this case\nClearly\nWhich has been mishandled by Democrats from the from the moment they decided that I was a woman who asked for confidentiality\nInto all the taxes just say that can't be proven user commonsense and she was outed for a reason they wanted their Anita Hill\nMoments that's all this ever was about they didn't care about Christine Blasey Ford didn't care about how she was sacrificed in the cause of\nBlowing up a Supreme Court nomination of this president they didn't care about any of that stuff\nYou think Republicans auditor they didn't have the information so use your head\nUtilized common sense tells you where that story will go that's number two of our foreign sat in the four biggest stories as we see it across nor can stay in the world number three a fire department employee causing some controversy as it relates to the Milwaukee fire and police commission I'll tell you that story next regime WGM Jay\n... used to be with you on this Friday thinking for something as always fifty degrees at Radio City [noise]\nNumber three of our foreign ... I didn't want to see stories like this and I'm a guy that supports\nPublic safety professionals as much as you can publicly support him because I think they have been one of the toughest jobs in the planets\nAnd frankly to disrespect them to some people not I'm not everyone but some people show to them is unwarranted but this story bothered me so I wanted to stick it in to the fore attend a former Milwaukee firefighters average coal Croft he was going to be Mayor Tom Barrett ... latest appointment to the city fire and police commission well\nSome digging was done on average coal cross and some emails came up in one of these went after police and this was obtained by the journal center will be open records which is a good thing\nHe labeled Milwaukee police I'm reading from the journal sentinel article by Dan buddies are poorly trained force of who abuses overtime are more interested in their wallets pension benefits and protecting the public and cost the city millions of lawsuits over excessive force sexual abuse and killing people those are the words of every coal crop in an email obtained by the journal sentinel\nHolden ... marked for ... who chaired vice chair of the public safety safety and health committee and was scheduled to vote on coal cross nomination said he was blown away by and I think they postponed the vote and I have to get the point of clarification on that but let me say this those are disqualifying comments\nYou're going to be tasked with overseeing the leadership of the market and fire police departments\nThis kind of information this kind of vitriol directed at another group of public safety professionals suggest to me you're not ready for this job suggested that you bring with\nYour application to this commission a bias that suggest you can't look at things objectively\nNow mayors pick these people based on their history and their experience and that's all great and you were if he was a former firefighter that part's fine but when you read those kinds of comments to suggest that something is not right here\nHe must make sure that anyone on the fire and police commission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we move forward as I was giving you a some live testimony from uh the center for this a little bit early this morning fifty one forty nine and a procedural vote to move this forward now to the Senate tomorrow and it's down to these really these five senators\nAnd and no surprise us You're on who these people are 'cause they're frequently in the mix when it comes down to these key votes Susan Collins Republican from Maine she was a yesterday will should be I guess tomorrow Jeff Flake yesterday same question what is tomorrow hold for him Lisa Murkowski from Alaska she was a note today\nDoes that signal that she will be a note tomorrow Heidi Heitkamp is already in no North Dakota Democrat\nOr a lot of people think she just essentially ended her political career in a very conservative state and Joe Manchin of West Virginia Democrat who I'm voting yesterday and the procedural votes will he maintain that\nYes affirmative vote in tomorrow's full Senate vote on the on the final confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh ... I'm reading the storylines swirling around this procedural vote and then there is tremendous amounts of uncertainty\nBecause you can't always make a correlation between these procedural votes in the final votes especially when you talk about a Supreme Court nominee and I'm a great point that's been made by a lot of people commenting on this is\nThis is rare air many of these votes are traditionally and historically landslides\nMany of the many of the recent Supreme Court nominees and then you go back to the days of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nThree no votes Ninety six yes this is a different time and I spend a lot of lot of the early part of the program talking about where we're out of the country what what's this all means I don't think we know ya but tomorrow's votes if it happens tomorrow will to kind of determine\nThat next phase which is between now and November's midterm elections gauging the response gauging what voters will take away\nWill they judge Republicans harshly based on affirmative vote for Brett Kavanaugh will they judged Democrats harshly for their treatments of Brett Kavanaugh and the forgotten figure and all this and I predict this will happen Christine Blasey Ford\nHer name will be lost in this\nNo one's gonna care about Christine Blasey Ford that's unfortunate uh a woman came forward I Believe she believes what she said but unfortunately she's gonna be one of those relics of history a and again the vote will determine a lot of that storyline but for her her treatments lack of\nConfidentiality when it was requested those things are things that I think any senator Republican or Democrat should look at going forward the news this next these committee with you on this Friday Richard WGM Jay\nLeno these videos on this Friday\nDean sue N. L. D. S. coming up later this afternoon on WGM Jay Giedd Wagner is live from Miller Park beginning at noon today of course every Friday eleven o'clock hour as the friday foreign to different people from two different walks of life today we're joined by Cory Peter since she's been on the show before writer researcher at the Wisconsin is different\nLaw liberty good morning and night and Tracy Johnson CEO ... but also\nMy favorite filling halls frankly there are there to have already or something I Want to jump right into a gym and chase you better be for a car you haven't been part of the friday form before we're gonna talk about the events that are happening across this country and this morning\nThe interest you bitter before a court you haven't been part of the friday form before we are talking about the events are happening across this country and this morning the Senate move forward a procedural vote to go to the full Senate tomorrow for votes on the nomination of one that Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court I Want to get your thoughts about\nThis nomination at this time and kind of what it means to you want is a woman to as as soon as the United states what does this nomination you\nWell I think Lindsey Graham said it well and the hearings um he called the most unethical sham I think he's exactly right um I just don't think there's evidence there to say that I'm Kavanaugh is for the abuser and not saying that Ford this never happened to forward but I just don't think the evidence is there to say that it was Kassoff\nThis race where the Democrats used Dr Ford is kind of this this red herring for ... and then the prospect of of sexual assault\nAnd I think that they were exposed for their inconsistencies and they're in sincerity to the real issue I mean even a Dianne Feinstein It's MORNING when she was you know black in about ... why she wasn't going to vote for him which was cutting on his record I\nMean if this was supposed to be about sexual assault and and this is what we really cared about why is this is the following all these different places and I think Trump is plane that's exactly right and the Republicans are playing this exactly right\nWhen they grab onto this and encourage Republicans to get out and vote for conservative so that we can sure there are fewer Democrats like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in those positions of power\nIf Kavanaugh gets confirmed is still up in the air Lisa Murkowski peeled off their shoes no no vote illusion of procedural side of this world and that's usually a pretty good indicator what will happen tomorrow\nHow does this change the dynamic in Washington DC we could have a another Supreme Court justices conservative\nWe've got to have a democratic group of senators and elected officials who are super irritated at what's happened to them they said well we also have Republican voters and elected officials who are on the opposite side what does this do if if Kavanaugh is confirmed wow how's the dynamic change starting as early as next week [noise]\nWell I think that they're the Republicans are going to be a you know fired up and justified in ... in\nIn their feelings because this was just such a disgrace to the process and they force this all to happen I I Am Kevin I wouldn't have been in a position to say that things he said to defend himself and to bring up all these\nThings are so irrelevant let's get back to an end at the end of the day Trump is going to tweak something and we're all going to be on that at some point no fixes\nThat are happening day right I completely agree and I I think that um I think that this was this is the Democratic they've told us the whole point of this whole thing for Democrats\nWas to uh just to find a way to smear him there's near their smear campaign did not work just as it did not work at all there is no evidence they weren't even able to bring it out bring on anybody else who had the testimony at the party there was there was no one else and so here we are with a story that has that has no backing\nUm and yeah I think Republicans are definitely on the other right on that's when I look for that for them\nBut here's the other thing polling now show is that people do people believe Dr for more than they believe\nJudge Kavanaugh and I think now the opportunity for Republicans is to explain\nThat that that doesn't matter isn't about emotion or personal feeling here's the process we need evidence we would all want that if we were in that same position\nRight here's what I don't get that this was about women ... US Senator Dianne Feinstein got this from mission in July sat on it as plenty days twenty days of some points\nHer or someone that works with her or somebody around her organization wheat confidential information would that Christine Blasey Ford wanted to keep confidential why does she not being called out for the [noise]\nWell I think I think Democrats have done is they've been able to um\nKind of ... kind of make this about women make us a winning issue um in their tactic has been to try and sell the idea that women are inherently believable\nI'm so suddenly someone who may be sympathetic to that and may be able to kind of I think I think that the danger that one can conflate things that happen to them with what we've heard during the hearings\nUm but you're right and I mean it doesn't mean that this is there's no evidence that doesn't mean that he was a man who uh has had no evidence brought against and should be found guilty and I I think you're right but I think Feinstein's you'll be the first time and and others to other Democrats who have just have conducted a smear campaign to be the ones how Russia matter or that's what we're\nRecording Peterson and the trees are just joining I I Want to play something for George is going to this um this is senator Kamala Harris and I figure since we have two women sitting in in the studio today I Want to get your response to what she said about this [laughter]\nNot not not interested\nIn I mean and and it's and it's just please leave without any\nThat it needs to be done of course not\nThat was California senator Kamala Harris she was referring to the president's comments Tuesday night at a rally in Mississippi I've said\nI don't understand why the president said he was frustrated was mad about what was his process has done to his nominate nominee for the Supreme Court I said it probably wasn't helpful on both sides your take on what she said and its impact potentially on this whole tomorrow quarter\nWell I I I don't I don't think I'm not I don't think he should have kind of look worse about it and joked about it the way he did\nUm I I don't I don't think it's going to affect Republicans long time now and I don't I don't think it's it's the way she made it so dramatic it's just so sad and it's just so like I don't think that's the only time I was doing like he shouldn't have been poking fun he shouldn't eat a lot of times they shouldn't be poking fun when he does but I mean that it wasn't over the top I don't think\nBut as a suburban white woman that debt suburban white woman who they who people say are all you know into supporting the the the ... you know Dr Ford hate Donald Trump", "show_name": "Wisconsin's Afternoon News", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "05"}
