{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "In the news of the uh the weekend and the the tragedy this uh [noise]\nAnd folded in Pittsburgh when it's been a lot of this time and therefore at Tempe talking about that story line and that's a that's a\nIncredible a dark day for the folks\nAgain one of those stories celebrating their face and and killed while doing it in a synagogue in Pittsburgh so much of the foreign tell me the motor voter to that um don't forget you can quickly identify all for the ... of four at ten you can see the ... theater\nIt's an energy feel musical featuring five triple threat accurate musician of dancers they give you more detail on that to the next break but are those tickets are are up for grabs if you can quickly identify these four at ten so we start with the story from Pittsburgh the tree of life synagogue gunman stormed into the building\nThere just practicing their face on a Saturday morning um\n[noise] the rabbi said he thought he heard loud bang you did hear a loud\nBang noises or metal coat rack of any ... pretty quickly that there was gunfire\nJeffrey ... is gone with ABC earlier today he did some good morning America\nTime within the next Fifteen seconds of\nThis repeatedly this apparently at that time just instinct I guess that that was not\nThe sound of a a piece of metal folding that it was a rapid fire\nQuickly made a phone call to the cops and tried to get people\nOut of the people who were towards the front of the sanctuary the number that were there I quickly tried to evacuate them up for for the back of the sites for\nSo here's an interesting little aspect to this the rabbi is crediting security training course that he took just a couple of months ago it was in August and what he said was I Would never have a cell phone on the on the center for for Jewish folks this advice is on a Saturday and it's when they go to synagogue and spend time in temple\nAnd he said he would never carry a cell phone but he happened to have won this day because he said after meeting with security folks\nThey suggested them hey this is something you may want to consider you don't have to use it but you should keep an eye on your person just as we now live in a new it's a new world for many of us and he said that definitely held\nOn here maybe got in some purpose for me being the community\nAnd perhaps some just filling what part of their purpose\nAnd the shooter now he's forty six years old am I going to say his name is in a dignified by by telling you what his name he's arrested inside the synagogue exchange fire with police officers they responded quickly made anti Semitic statements during the\nShooting it's it's one of those storylines the Jewish community Jewish people have been prosecuted for thousands of years the fact that this is still the storyline in this country is frankly starting and to me\nBut that anti Jewish anti Semitic hate and rather is is increasing in this country driven in many ways by the fact that there's places where these people can go and talk to each other inspiring these acts of hate and we saw it play out ...\nClearly in in the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nThe president deserve any criticism for allowing this tuned to continue\nI I've I've heard this question asked all over this all over this weekend the president is not responsible for the acts of a lunatic what the president should be doing however is to be calming the community which in his case is the country and saying we're better than this\nWe have things under control not the point that the media\nNot to to talk about politics this is a time for calm reassuring how can we get past us how can we move forward and I think the president has dropped the ball on that the president's not responsible for the government's actions clearly\nAnd there's there's rhetoric and vitriol on both sides of the political aisle anybody that says there isn't is not paying attention I'm there is a responsible building by the president and he needs to pick up the mantle and do the job of president\nSource of editing this up on you there I was going to ask you about the whole me oral thing obviously everyone knows your story when you were the miracle creek and what happened\nAt the ... temple this is similar to that in Pittsburgh what's that mean are going to deal with no\nI mean there's got to deal with again calming his community telling them things are going to be okay from what I've seen so far he's done a really good job of that ... the great you know I I hesitate to use the word grades but\nBecause there's been all these these attacks and mass shootings play out\nFor the first time and probably our nation's history local leaders now have a kind of a game plan for dealing with it I didn't have that\nAnd I was benefit I told the story a bunch of times on the on the air by uh the actual the conduct of mayor Steve Hogan from Aurora, Colorado who's now passed away from cancer passed away in ... this year\nUm who called me that night and said calm your community reassure them talk about what you know don't speculate his words his wisdom was able to help me\nInteresting story yesterday I heard from many of the people that I had connected with throughout my journey from Oak Creek six years ago they came back to me and said thinking about you today as somebody who lived through one of these things how you doing how you feel and there is that I mentioned with gene and gene this one is that weird fraternity of leaders that's out there now\nBut that's that's not a good thing\nIt's not a a a bond you want to have because it means people were needlessly killed in this case in a place where you know you don't want to accept new members know and frankly it's horrifying or continue to talk about these stories that being said I've asked all my guests today what do you do about it there's no easy answers you\nShort term more security absolutely we see it in schools\nI can tell you that places of worship you mentioned it with what the the the rabbis decision to carry a a cell phone smartphone they are changing adapting their behavior based on the reality of the world we live in now that's a good thing\nAnd I ... at some\nPart of me says it it saved lives police are are in law enforcement are much better at dealing with these things but that's all immediate short term stuff long term\nIt is going to require some anger management some ability to say to people in this country what is driving your frustration and your hostility\nAnd aggressively going after and I mean this sincerely progressing aggressively going after people who are threatening people on social media not treating it like it's just free speech because when he was threatened someone with direct violence that goes beyond what is protected and that is a\nDifference I think that's one of the things we need to to highlight here number one of our for our town of course the or the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue number two coming up local reaction to that shooting we'll hear from a local rabbi and also I'm One of the are frequent guest on the program alone accounting Markey Jewish Federation of speaking\nTo the issue at hand for their community and our community how you deal with the mass shooting in this case in Pittsburgh at a synagogue over the weekend more next right here in the ...\nI think it's a city all night and drop them on the repertory theater and she was frankly identifying all for today's for us hand the all night started as an energy feel musical featuring five triple threat actor\nAnd actress musicians and dancers y'all maestro takes you a musical Journey Through his from the Nineteen thirties and forties from some of the greats including Duke Ellington\nFrank lesser and the ... from the funky jive of Harlem to the romance of the stage door campaign and civil jazz blues American song book standard such as many of the ... in the mood fascinating rhythm I'll be seeing you it doesn't mean a thing of it ain't got that swing and the white\nCliffs of Dover that's all for you if you can quickly identify all four of the four I saw a euro will scare them there for like I I had to make it fun man that's up for grabs it incorrectly\nIdentify off for the for a time and I and I must feel guilty laughing during a serious conversation about a shooting in Pittsburgh but I mean there has to be some some lightness to uh to the day I guess in in dealing with these tragedies is not something that uh\nAnybody ever wants to do or look forward to but um when the going thing is when you have events like this and and there's been frankly to many of them\nWe are seeing people emerged that that are taking\nThe mantle and run with that people are trying to do the right thing trying to help 'em the story and makes people feel better and that's the case here as well as we deal with local reaction to the shooting at the at the synagogue and Pittsburgh it's just some outstanding local leaders commenting on it as well\nYes a very Nelson spoke with a lot of time in front of the program she's been on before and ah if you do not know her she is the\nCommunity relations council director for the Milwaukee Jewish Federation and he asked her about to visit this he asked her about just kind of a culture of society right now and if that led to this and he was part of her response\nI think there is ... the anti Semitism that happens there's a reason that we have we're always vigilant about security there is a part of me that is\nAlways expecting a kind of what I Do I'm sure I'm but I Do think that we were in an era of [noise]\nReal permissive now toward um\nViolent course talking about people and others um ad hoc ad hominem attacks\nUm I don't know about you I don't want to watch political ads Cantonese Kennedy I Can't wait for the election to end for multiple reasons his campaign but mostly I see a cat an ad and I turn off TV [laughter] because they're so nasty and so personal we're constantly\nBut mostly I the ... and ... and I turn off it how efficient because they're so nasty and so personal we're constantly hearing other people talking about them as others and therefore I don't know not deserving of empathy compassion\nAn interesting point made by a line and she has a friend of the show and I just thought that was there a couple of weeks ago talking about some of the issues in Milwaukee and\nTwitter responds with this actually the the the Twitter safety accounts and often we made a mistake and Michelle Ritchie first alerted us to the threats made against her the tweet clearly violated our rules and should have been removed we are deeply sorry for that\nSome of my question for Twitter and all of a social media you have rules in place\n\nYou're making millions if not billions of dollars\n\nBased on a platform I suggest solely exist solely for the amusement of its users has no other real purpose and you can't police the behavior that's out there\nEspecially when someone notify zoo of that behavior it's not self policing where shell rich you told you there was an issue here\nAnd you still couldn't act on it\nAnd my question for these companies the Facebook's the twitters others I'm not even talking about some of these extreme social media platforms which cater to violence and hates that's a whole nother reality\nAnd while I Believe in free speech fundamentally free speech the threatens violence is not protected shouldn't be protected\nAnd especially in this case when rush of Ritchie was directly threatened by somebody on a on a social media platforms\nIt doesn't need to be that difficult\nIf you're going to have a platform that involves written communication as as the case with Twitter you need to have policies and practices and enforcement the follow up on that\nAnd I'm a big fan of Twitter\nBut it's hard not to see connections between the ramping up of this anger and hatred and violence\nWhen it's allowed to take place on these huge social media platforms it's despicable and frankly it's not acceptable at Twitter\nReally ... and I'll take that says well we made a mistake you were notified about something that was serious you didn't do anything about it now you feel guilty about it now you're responding she\nShe had a rush hour she had a better kind of but I Can't read it on the air and that's just one of one example of what happened in that case but it happens every day\nWith bullying\nThe political nonsense that you see play out where people can't get past elections keep all people can't get past policy the demonization of elected officials and you've got to ask yourself as a public\nWho do you think's going to run for these officers when you terrorize the people that are in the Republican or Democrat what do you think's going to want to do those jobs for low pay\nAnd the vast majority of those jobs are low pay when talking about local government so number for my for than\nI think social media is broken and the fact that we're talking about this again and again and again the storyline Boeing mass shootings\nAnd the threats made on social media suggest they're not doing anything about it\nThey will not an advocate of of government stepping in at some points if you're going to run these platforms changing the conversation changes die that dynamic in our country you got to be responsible and so this point to this moments you're making a heck of a lot of money\nBut you're not being being very socially responsible and that is wrong\nThis summer for of our for us and the four biggest source as we see it across the Milwaukee the state in the world gotta give away those marquee rep tickets to go with color number six the Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty would be nice to Jordan coming up next the president's all in on terrorists but are they killing Wisconsin businesses\nThat snacks or during the ... ten forty fives these have you with you um WC and chicken breast in James from while it's also he's the winner of our for our town home game home edition for playing along was heavily focused on the shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue so\nI'm Will stone of some more time and I'm going to be joining the eleven or a eleven thirty five by a rabbi Jacob herb are ever going to talk about\nWhat that feels like from the Jewish perspective the Jewish community reeling from this attack in Pittsburgh [noise] you know we can all\nTry to assess what um what the impact of the mass shooting feels like I went through one Oak Creek and twenty twelve but uh\nThere's there's some direct correlation to empire anti Semitism and and the feelings that the Jewish people in this country have felt for a long time and I just saw on the er I'm One of my monitors that are threats of violence because the anti Semitism or Seventy percent of the last year so there's there's a strong\nFocus hopefully on on breaking that down and we'll talk to rabbi Herbert at eleven thirty five I Want to spend a few moments talking about um the the tariff is shall we haven't I haven't discussed on the show recently\nAnd I know there was a there was a a gathering last week of some folks to talk about the impact Senator Ron Johnson was there of these terrorists on local business steel and aluminum even things like the I'm ready for this story or by repairing the mortgage Journal Sentinel impact on local fish fries\nWhat you want to hit somebody in the pocket book in in the hearts and minds impact our local fish fry on Friday nights so I'm reading a story and it suggests that we have a lot of fish that's caught in the U.S and in us waters or in Canada but most of it as process in China\nWhich is one of the countries now that we're facing this this tariff battle with\nAnd at some point because it can results\nEnough you know the friday night fish fry costing a lot more and that's what I've been hearing from local manufacturers and local business owners is that they're worried that the short term pain\nBecomes a much longer term of pain and not just limited in scope that impacts your business so they have this town hall last week about a hundred people went there was that house go international a company that makes hydraulic intellect lecture electro mechanical come on this for vehicles and construction equipment\nAnd right now the estimate is higher tariffs in Wisconsin Ninety five million dollars of impact just in August\nThat's up forty seven percent from last year\nRestaurant industry as I said part of the discussion of seafood stoves all impacted by the China conversation and if I Know anything about Wisconsin consumers they're very sensitive to price I don't want to call them cheap skate split they care about what things cost\nIs couponing and such a big deal mistake when frankly what technology should have been by the wayside a long time ago\nThis president's strategy and congressman Duffy mentioned it earlier we had him on the strategy is to deal with a short term pain to get long term game he's had some success the new deal with Mexico and Canada\nThat has been uh when when it with other countries Asia China\nEuropean Union\nWere not the area and hardly is one of those big local stories that's been impacted by the steel issue\n\nIt's a big gamble but don't think there's not going to be short term pain here because there isn't in local manufacturers and companies are already expressing their feelings\nAnd\nUltimately they don't absorb those costs they get passed on to consumers and consumers have a long memory\nWere state that ships a lot of product out of the states and none of this country\nAnd when the price of that product goes up either domestically and internationally usually the result is less product gets purchase and that's the risk for the president here like I said he achieved some games with a new agreement between Canada and Mexico\n\nMexico Canada agreement but that is\nGames with a new agreement between Canada and Mexico\n\nThe U.S Mexico Canada agreement but that is only part of the story China Asia in general is this vast market place for us products\nBoth the raw materials to make things in this country and finished products that we sent overseas and I feel the pain from local manufacturers because they are really really really\nUnder the ground here and ah the quicker we get this worked out the quicker that pain go away but they are they're expressing their frustration and or else said he could even have some impact on the mid term elections as as these companies who are really just people\nExpress their opinion about how things are going that could have negative political impact for Republicans and conservatives or something to watch on that regard as well after the break\nMore I don't want to say bad news but just more threats more violence in a in a country that's reeling from just\nAnd we're not even into the when I called the most challenging\nDriving environment which is snow ice cold temperatures all of those things so my question for you is what do you think we are friday of every second launching the free for the moment at least for a year she serves in Milwaukee the how\nWhat do you think's gonna happen it's going to be a success but people jump on this thing it's free will they wait eight ten twelve Fifteen minutes to get a ride on this for the next station or a couple of stations down and then jump off\nOr will be one of those scenarios play down in some cities across the country where they build one of these things and no one ever rides well you see empty streetcar trolling the streets of Milwaukee\nBeautiful street cars all lit up but no people inside what one four seven nine nine once just want to be I can a mortgage talking text line the Milwaukee St ...\nAll the discussion all the controversies all comes to have this Friday as we launch one year free service my challenge for the free service\nTypically when you launch something when you test something you can measure the results and the impact based on the on the real life conditions\nOn the environment that you're in that's not the case you you're given it away for free\nWe won't know what's the ridership will be when it actually costs something to write unless somebody is willing to pay for a free street car for the rest of his existence which is not cheap as to ask are friends of how to want to be a hotel casino\nHop kicks it off this Friday what do you think for one for seven nine nine one six twenty mortgage talking sex line you can find us on Facebook as well as baseball dot com slash six twenty WGM Jay more\nNext on that's seems to be with you on this Monday thank you for listening is or what do you think this is the one degree and not a bad day in October late October in Wisconsin\nMy my my a level of success for weather is over fifty at this time of year I'm happy to some of that and then when you start getting a little cold but that's not bad some sun is shining at least your Radio City you got to take\nThat for what it's worth talking about the half\nAs much as this Friday finally those ones who've been waiting for it it's launching it will be free thanks for the than folks at the bottom line in the hotel and casino\nI'm not a fan of it some people are dead souls weighing in on on a Twitter Jeff says it going to go to and from a much cheaper parking facilities prevents it might start showing some signs of life\nOver again I have my face the money that sort of pull up Bob is ready to kick off his mark history kind of service as we can walk to use it a great success or a boondoggle right now\nWe divulge winning significantly by Seventy four\nPercent twenty six percent or got plenty of tax on this let's go with a to switch to the street cars and costs are always empty or just one sleeping passenger the tracks are dangerous to pedestrians bicyclists and motor cyclists waste the money\nBetter investment would have been small frequent flyer buses that certainly and there was seen\n... two six two as well money could have been better spent on real transport some outlying areas suburbs to keep freeways less congested I don't disagree with that one Kevin from a ski go I think a better use the money would have been to carve out areas on streets like breathing waterfront designated pick up and drop outs for rides here is like ... and left and uh let's take some\nCalls us go to building a ton of Milwaukee you're on WGM chicken morning do\nGreat show make my way I'm a little bit you around them my other daughter a split up the cost of all I I'm On my most don't they don't\nLike it probably I don't I don't want to make it under right it was about ...\nAh the cost of the free ridership from the first year\nOr so of course the ... already why aren't perfect sort of a last huh [laughter] well\nWell one I Would make a blanket statement things were called the one I support transit when it makes sense I was I was a big fan of connecting people's people's two jobs and uh we do that no creek I see it happening between Markey county in Waukesha county that part of that makes sense\nI actually think there is a potential there for a little further uh connections that gets people jobs him and I guess the clearest most glaring example would be Foxconn I don't know that\nI'm biased against mass transit I just don't think the ... is a form of mass transit that makes the most sense and thanks for the call bill as always you can listen to the program was go to Kyle some ...\nThanks for taking my call you're kind of what is yeah\nI actually work on a ... a lot of the inner ... back mhm at night game\nAnd the driver there but they changed the white wind that are about to enter that made it I Know but we've known about any I'm a little over ... why why am I Am a\nOf a green light ... and ... are there are either go through\nOr backed up and I get up there where they go on the ballot box or minutes at the end no clue what do you know I Would be like yeah but but knowing on better but I mean I'm just waiting for that they're bringing are going to the red light\nAnd somebody who's observing that used to get the sense that drivers understand what their responsibilities are\nNo not at all the Arab All right I mean that the lying\nThen they changed the wind began with quite go straight out that ain't though there's no real sign that the wreck occurred but I mean they need to make more than that and like I said I mean we've come a time where I mean the train has a very annoying or Trevor hurting it\nBut we've encouraged anywhere I go far back that they don't know what's going on in her mouth and you are but no I mean\nThat in fact I don't know the only one that I bought that way but on a daily basis we broke out quite a while but yeah there you are oh\nAll right thanks for the call ... ... there's going to be a learning curve here for ... operators and drivers\n... again we haven't even gotten to the challenging part of our driving year when when the snow and ice become a real thing when when the snow drifts and snow piles and hardened chunks of ice impact everything\nSo speaking this this dynamic relationship between\nThe streetcar vehicles pedestrians is going to be really interesting as I said I reached out to some local attorneys on this and that there are already loss and will we see that going forward potentially let's go to Dick in graft and you're in W. teams you can morning to\nGood morning I'm I've had some experience in writing and using light rail and other cities and take Tampa for example you can take light rail from downtown Tampa to wipe or city and I've done that one\nUm I Would say that it might get Fifteen Percent occupancy at any time [noise] ah I don't see how they're paying the bills that a concern I got for the one in Milwaukee\nI'm I live in New York City from two thousand two to two thousand five on the subway to work every day it's the concentration of people that want to move from point a to point B that's going to pay the bills\nWhile we were in New York we went over to Hoboken and Jersey City to look at apartments thinking it's a lot cheaper over there and we might want to live there they had a light rail then we wrote that a number of times on various weekend looking at apartments\nAnd often we were the only people in the cars now\nTimes on various weekend looking at apartments\nAnd often we were the only people in the cars now a month ago we were back they're staying in Jersey City and a lot of people are writing the light rail now but they have thousands and thousands of a new apartment buildings high rise buildings\nTwenty five to thirty five stories tall that people are living in and\nThose are the people that are using a light rail and they use the light rail to get from wherever they live two uh two different half stations\nRight that allows them to take the the path train to Manhattan\nYeah I think I think it is in Great Britain called drinking green point it it's going to be about density I think there's a gamble being made easier by those folks in Milwaukee there's zero you know we got some density increasing the third worn a little bit down town\nWe have the potential of the of the other developments that could be could be coming up on the ground these high rises these condos these apartments that could increase the density and uh provide a market for these things but also mentally\nThe one place that would have made sense for me is to get people to Miller Park from down so I think I Would have been a no brainer you know you could have done something else connected some some a lively restaurant areas the reward something like that the roasted they've chosen\nI question whether those are the Right rally she's probably reasons why they picked those places\nBut right now that's the big question mark when it's free to get some ridership when it's not free what happens next you weigh in on Facebook at Facebook dot com so she's twenty WTO O. J. on Twitter as well with my show pulls up boondoggle are great success what will the happy\nAnd of course I mean I can a mortgage talking sections for one for seven nine nine months six twenty\nOr might monogamy falls you're I'm next to Jim Jim\nHave different standards that they use some locate nine eleven some could locate sort of focus on terrorism more broadly and so we touch on those that are Common Core individual state standards should try to focus on them and sort of classes\nAnd schools where they are and so I mean something with our school programs that particular is really of course people are going to be focusing on\nOn a tax in September but trying to sort of pull it away where nine eleven ... to a lot of different plans and idea throughout the course of the year and so we see that um in terms of the the offerings that we have kept schools they didn't end in church relevance not just for the camera but throughout the school\nYear so they have night programs at school programs for field trips they have programs for schools are coming in flying in from out of state said like when you go to Washington DC if you're sending folks and kids to New York for a similar situation something like that they have all of this in place because they find it to be so important and he was talking to a little bit about the curriculum\nThey also offer you know PowerPoints scholarships I mean there's so many different things that they offer to schools to help with the educational process and this is something that the government family in key will ask them wants to bring to this memorial here\nIn Wisconsin has something similar to that where you can just bring the songs together in really shine a light on the fact that ordinary Americans did extraordinary things on that day it's it wasn't just the terrorists they got you know we all think about the planes hitting the towers\nIt's important to remember that that there is a war on terror is still going on by the way\nBut the fact that the the country came together and did these amazing things to help each other and it's still happening even now with this memorial\nHim in the phrases never forget it but I I think for so many young people they don't have that direct connection and and and it's actually surprising has taken this long to to kind of put this kind of a memorial together to give us a Wisconsin connection to the story that played out in on on our television sets but on a ground zero in New York City\nI think it's important that we teach young people that this is what happened this is what you can learn from it and and have a historical connection because too much of our educational process is getting away from history and I think this speaks to that directly in the folks and ... them and the entire area can benefit from what will be a tremendous tremendous memorial and\nBy the way we're as some of the things that you remember from school years later or things like a field trip I remember a specific sites that I saw or different things that I've touched you know and held this is one of those opportunities so if you have a field trip so you have kids even if they're watching from ...\nElementary and going to that that's that's and when that's one more person learning about something and then retain that information\nWhat's the word tactile where you can actually feel it and you can put your hand on the ... and and feel the sense of what that that little piece of a massive building what's that look like and what happens on that day on nine eleven\nSo we have several stories on the website WGM dot com go to the raise the bean W teams that cares link and you can hear all the stories that we've told the last few weeks all the different aspects and it's really it's on fire you really to hear\nWhat some of these folks are doing and what what the goal ... parents are doing it's just it's a remarkable story ended up itself the fact that they're all coming together to help raise this beaming you can help do it for one for seven nine nine one six twenty if you text the word cares C. A. R. E. S.\nTwo for one for seven and nine one six twenty will send you all the information back\nPlease if you have the opportunity to give a donation we'd love it and now we will help chip away at this forty thousand dollars have returns raised plus you can use that same number in just call if you want to send a check instead Jordan's got the address rather than saying there so he can easily help with that and just give you the address if you want to send a check rather than do something on my\nGreat stuff as always ... raised to be in front of you change that cares radio found on Wednesday yes that'll be a good opportunity to donate but don't wait till then you don't have to wait till Wednesday help us raise that being coming up in the ten o'clock all across the forehead tend the four biggest sources we see it across Milwaukee's a state in the world\nAnd I can tell you right now it's going to be heavily focused on the the shooting at the send the guy in Pittsburgh from a lot of different angles who this person was why you chose us in a guy local reaction to that shooting\nAnd I even a piece about social media and it's going to that story line that's all coming up next right here on WGM share your money\nNo such as you on this Monday [noise]\nBecause they have the money but it doesn't feel like a half his money given the news of the weekend and the the tragedy this a\nAnd Pittsburgh when I spent a lot of the time and this for a temp talking about that story line and that's a that's a\nIncredible a dark day for the folks\nAgain one of those stories celebrating their face and and killed while doing it's in a synagogue in Pittsburgh so much of the foreign tell me the most of them voted to that um don't forget you can quickly identify all for the ... of four at ten you can see the ... theater\nIt's an energy feel musical featuring five triple threat actor musician and dances they give me more detail on that after the next break but those tickets are are up for grabs if you can quickly identify these four at San so we start with the story from Pittsburgh the tree of life synagogue gun\nThe those tickets are are up for grabs if you can quickly identify these four at ten so we start with the story from Pittsburgh the tree of life synagogue gunman stormed into the building\nThere just practicing their face on a Saturday morning um [noise] the rabbi said have you thought he heard loud bang you did hear a loud bang noises or mental coat rack and then he realized pretty quickly that there was gunfire\nJeffrey ... is on with ABC earlier today he did some good morning America\nTime within the next Fifteen seconds of\nThis advocated Lewis apparently at that time just instinct I guess that that was not\nThe sound of a a piece of metal folding that it was a breath and fire\nQuickly made a phone calls with the cops and tried to get people out of the\nPeople who were towards the front of the sanctuary the numbers that were there I quickly tried to evacuate them up\nFor for the fact that the same short\nSo here's an interesting little aspect to this the rabbi is crediting security training course that he took just a couple of months ago it was in August and what he said was I Would never have a cell phone on the unfettered free for Jewish folks this emphasis on a Saturday and it's when they go to synagogue and spend time in temple\nAnd he said he would never carry a cell phone but he happened to have one in this day because he said after meeting with security folks\nThey suggested them hey this is something you may want to consider you don't have to use it but you should keep on on your person just as we now live in a new it's a new world for many of us and he said that definitely held\nOn here maybe got us some purpose for me being in the community\nAnd perhaps some just filling what part of that purpose like the\nAnd the shooter now he's forty six years old am I going to say his name of a dignified by by telling you his name he's arrested inside the synagogue exchange fire with police officers they responded quickly made anti Semitic statements during the shooting it's it's one of those storylines\nThe Jewish community Jewish people have been prosecuted for thousands of years the fact that this is still a story line in this country is frankly starting and to me\nBut that anti Jewish anti Semitic hate and rhetoric is is increasing in this country driven in many ways by the fact that there's places where these people can go and talk to each other inspiring these acts of hate and we saw it\nPlay out quite clearly in in the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nDoes the president deserve any criticism for allowing this tone to continue\nI I've I've heard this question asked all over this all over the weekend the president is not responsible for the acts of all doing it to what the president should be doing however is to be calming the community which in his case is the country and saying we're better than this\nWe have things under control knocked appointed the media\nNot to to talk about politics this is a time for calm reassuring how can we get past us how can we move forward and I think the president has dropped the ball on that the president's not responsible for this government's actions clearly\nAnd there's there's rhetoric and vitriol on both sides of the political aisle anybody that says there isn't is not paying attention I'm there is a responsible building by the president and he needs to pick up the mantle and do the job of president sorts\nOf stuff on you there I was going to ask you about the whole me oral thing obviously everyone knows your story when you were the miracle creek and what happened at the ... temple this is similar to that in Pittsburgh what's that mean you're going to deal with no\nI mean there's got to deal with again calming his community telling them things are going to be okay from what I've seen so far he's done a really good job of that as the great you know I I hesitate to use the word grades but because there's been all these these attacks and mass shootings play out\nFor the first time and probably our nation's history local leaders now have a kind of a game plan for dealing with it I didn't have that\nAnd I was benefit I told the story a bunch of times on the on the air by the actions the conduct of mayor Steve Hogan from Aurora, Colorado who's now passed away from cancer passed away in ... this year\nUm who called me that nice and calm your community reassure them talk about what you know don't speculate his words his wisdom was able to help me interesting story yesterday\nI heard from many of the people that I had connected with throughout my journey from Oak Creek six years ago they came back to me and said thinking about you today as somebody who lived through one of these things how you doing how you feel and there is that I mentioned with gene and gene this one is that weird fraternity of leaders\nThat's out there now but that's that's not a good thing\nIt's not a a a bond you want to have because it means people were needlessly killed in this case in a place where you know you don't want to accept new members know and frankly it's horrifying that will continue to talk about these stories that being said I've asked all my guests today what do you do about it there's no easy answers you\nAnd I am I'm gonna I'm gonna ... what I what I've learned one short term additional security will always benefits you're not going to be absolute and I can be perfect but additional security will help any large play any place where people gather you have to have you have at least have a\nDiscussion about security or training that tells you here's what I Do when I'm confronted with a with a shooter someone there to have them doing his heart\nAnd the other thing is I'm a big proponent of conversation talking to people that look pray speak differently than you do it's getting harder and harder to do that in the coon worlds we live in where people come home from work\nGoing in their garage garage door it goes down they go in the house that you can only watch one channel all night go back and repeat that same process the next day\n\nAnd silly and and congressman Sean Duffy mentioned is that we celebrate family not just our own families but the families of other in our neighborhoods in our places of worship in our communities figuring that connection points is going to be a big\nPathway to kind of at least slowing these things down were violent country\nFor a country that I think I said it earlier which is just an hasn't anger management problem which is playing out in politics and culture in conversation fixing that will help us resolve some of these other things so not an easy solution by any stretch of imagination but something we have to pay attention to going forward\n[noise] ten thirty five seems to be with you on this Monday you can win tickets don't forget the ... pregnant identify all four of today's for ... let me recap I'm for you number one the latest on the Pittsburgh\nShooting at a synagogue on Saturday and I were to local reaction to that shooting played some audio and a lot of time walking Jewish Federation every three\nI just ask the questions of the country have an anger management problem and it's certainly playing out in public discourse\nAwesome show notes a couple of things one all the podcasts are up now so if you want to hear your sense of these teams that cares raised the bean piece that's on now are great interview with congressman Sean Duffy who joined me for about twenty minutes this morning talking about the shooting\nWhat Congress could do that is up and also Monday morning quarterback presented by ... hotel casino with\nWith gray with a great ... and and the last one I forgot James winter center the editor right Wisconsin we also talked about the shooting and ask that question about anger management from countries perspective amount of individual perspective I'm On a raft of four I tend to with\nThis one and I asked the question is social media broke and I'm gonna get if I'm going to tell your story give you the details of this thing and you tell me\nSo October eleventh which is my birthday a little less than two weeks before the discovery of the first of these fourteen improvised explosive devices\nThe person responsible for science devices tweets at Rochelle rich is a political analysts just on Fox that's a lot of TV appearances he tweets this to her this is what he says\nWe will see you for sure hug your loved ones real close every time you leave your home that's what the tree read and then he threatened her\nShow rich she goes to Twitter and says hey Twitter remember when I report the guy was making threats towards me after my parents on Fox News and you guys sent back of BS response by how you didn't find it that serious well guess what if the guy who's been sending bombs the high profile politicians\nAnd this was the first time this has happened\nSomebody that's on TV on the radio is threatened by one of these not jobs lunatics in this manner it's not to report it to the social media platform\nWhich in the case of ... rich she did a six or seven minute investigation said nothing the seizure basically that was their first response of course when the news broke that it was actually somebody responsible for the mailing of these fourteen packages\nOf course when the news broke that it was actually somebody responsible for the mailing of these fourteen packages\nTwitter responds with this actually the the the Twitter safety accounts and update we made a mistake on the show Ritchie first alerted us to the threat made against her the tweet clearly violated our rules and should have been removed we are deeply sorry for that some of my question for Twitter\nAnd all of a social media you have rules in place\n\nYou're making millions if not billions of dollars\n\nBased on a platform and suggest solely exist so it's the amusement of its users has no other real purpose and you can't police the behavior\nThat's out there especially when someone notify you of that behavior it's not self policing which show that she told you there was an issue here and you still couldn't act on it\nAnd my question for these companies the Facebook's the twitters others I'm not even talking about some of these extreme social media platforms which cater to violence and hates that's a whole nother reality\nAnd while I Believe in free speech fundamentally free speech the threatened violence is not protected shouldn't be protected\nAnd especially in this case when where shall Ritchie was directly threatened by somebody on a on a social media platform\nIt doesn't need to be that difficult if you're going to have a platform that involves written communication\nAs as is the case with Twitter you need to have policies and practices and enforcement the follow up on that\nAnd I'm a big fan of Twitter\nBut it's hard not to see connections between the ramping up of this anger and hatred and violence\nWhen it's allowed to take place on these huge social media platforms it's despicable and frankly it's not acceptable at Twitter\nReally sends an update says well we made a mistake you were notified\nAbout something that was serious you didn't do anything about it now you feel guilty about it now you're responding\n\nShe she had to rush hour but she had a better kind of but I Can't read it on the air and that's just one of one example of what happened in that case but it happens every day\nWith bullying\nThe political nonsense that you see play house where people can't get past elections keep all people can't get past policy the demonization of elected officials and you gotta ask yourself as a public\nWho do you think's going to run for these offices when you terrorize the people that are in the Republican or Democrat what do you think's going to want to do those jobs for low pay\nAnd the vast majority of those jobs are low pay when talking about local government so number for my fourth time\nI think social media is broken and the fact that we're talking about is\nAgain and again and again it's the storyline Boeing mass shootings\nAnd the threats made on social media suggest they're not doing anything about it\n\nAnd well not an advocate of of government stepping in at some points if you're going to run these platforms changing the conversation chains have died a dynamic in our country you got to be responsible\nAnd so this point to this moments you're making a heck of a lot of money\nBut you're not being being very socially responsible and that is wrong\nThis summer for about four times the four biggest stores as we see it across Milwaukee the state in the world got to give away those marquee rep tickets to go with color number six to Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty be nice to Jordan coming up next the president's

be joining the eleven or a eleven thirty five by a rabbi Jake um herb or I'm going to talk about\nWhat that feels like from the Jewish perspective the Jewish community reeling from this attack in Pittsburgh you know we can all\nTry to assess what um what the impact of a mass shooting feels like I went through one Oak Creek and twenty twelve but uh\nThere's there's some direct correlation to employ anti Semitism and and the feelings that the Jewish people in this country and felt for a long time and I just saw on the er I'm One of my monitors the threats of violence that at the anti Semitism around Seventy percent in the last year so there's there's a\nStrong focus hopefully\nOn on breaking that down and we'll talk to rabbi Herbert at eleven thirty five I Want to spend a few

people jump on this thing it's free will they wait eight ten twelve Fifteen minutes to get a ride on this is the next station or a couple of stations down and then jump off\nOr will be one of those scenarios of play down in some cities across the country where they build one of these things and no one ever rides where you see empty streets are showing the streets in Milwaukee\nBeautiful street cars all lit up no people inside what ones for seven nine nine wants to just one of the act in the mortgage talking types lined the Milwaukee Streetcar all the discussion\nAll the controversies all comes to have this Friday as we launch one year a free service my challenge for the free service\nTypically when you launch something when you test something you can measure the results and the impact based on the on the real life conditions\nOn the environment that you're in that's not the case you you're given it away for free\nWe won't know what the ridership will be when it actually costs something to ride unless somebody is willing to pay for a free three times for the rest of his exist which is not cheap as to ask our friends have Pato army hotel casino\n... takes it off is friday

money could have been better spent on real transport some outlying areas suburbs to keep freeways less congested I I don't disagree with that one\nKevin from mosquito I think a better use the money

time while the president like I say is his own worst enemy and he certainly ... this climate\nThat the media plays into it as well I mean you just you see no positive stories about President Trump and and it's always okay it doesn't matter what Trump does how can we figure out a way to to criticize him and try to make him look bad\nAnd if you think that that doesn't play to a certain part of the

way that you know that some of them but at the same time you can have fun grades as they were saying it though is that right\nWell I mean it it it's going to be the ... again and it's there are certain media ... that are out there and that's the way a story is going to be spun it again I I I go back to where were you had the the left wing nut job\nYou know what was it last year year and a half ago who travels from Illinois to Washington with a high power right who's living out of his band and ended up shooting the Republican congressman well okay that this guy was a Democrat activists I'm not blaming the Democrats for the fact that this nut job grabs a rifle and start shooting\nBut but you don't see that but that's not the way this is portrayed whereas you know in this particular situation where you have a cook\nIt decides to send out all these different pipe bombs or whatever locate Trump is responsible for for this climate I mean the bottom line is lots of blame to go around and I think\nThat there is I think the mainstream media would do well to me to be a little bit introspective on this and wonder Ari are there are times when we end up\nGoing too far and do we own our own to the extent we're going to talk about divisiveness do we help than those flames as well and that's not a defense of some of the over the top things that President Trump says for one for seven nine nine one six plenty of friends on the west side Frederick WGM drink good afternoon yeah\nBut after I think you know both have a have a responsibility you know living in a democracy and and both are part of that that Margaret see 'em you know you you were talking about pushing the Trump likes to push back\nRight uh and the media to a pushes back because you know they're under attack and Trump has a tendency to make it personal ... makes her song act any singles out you know a certain media right in a democracy\nAnd um so uh and every day and uh she likes to manage their nose and he has the bully pulpit and the bully profit is far more effective and stronger and and gets more attention from different news media if uh\nYou know he doesn't like why he goes to you know my favorite pick you know without getting you know personal as though you know which one are political and saying which one's more biased and the other you know they're biased you know all over the place by the president\nMost of all being a leader you know the media isn't doesn't take a leadership or the president like the whole\nYou know has this role as a leader\nAnd what he says means something church that their constituents like in the Catholic Church for example and the pope speak you'd better be listening and I think his constituents feel the same way because they are ... you know his talking points\nYou know and and so that's all they have so he should be more careful you know\nWell I yeah I mean I I agree with you to call it and if you miss him actually a really interesting point as well do you know we talk about the mainstream media like it's this giant monolith\nBut you know you were saying that the Trump tends to get personal the mainstream media isn't isn't really a giant monolith ... its people it it's it's individuals men and women it's his editors reporters and I think collectively and I'm going to generalize now I think\nA lot of a lot of reporters very very thin skin and then and then put the TV or news me they're very very thin skin because they're not used to\nBeing being question there used to being the ones who say okay I'm I'm going to be the arbiter of what's right and I'm going to be the person that decides what gets reported in the fact that cetera\nThey're not used to having somebody like President Trump who goes on in in ... on the attack and calls them out\nAnd again I think I'm speaking generalities there's some of these people that are very very thin skinned and they don't like it and I get it I mean they they don't like it you got the leader of the free world it's attacking them so what that does is it makes them individually get their backs up and I get it that's the natural thing\nYou know like Trump he feels he's big attack he lashes out\nAnd I think you have individual reporters and editors and things like that who on the other side they feel they're being attacked and what they decided to do is they decided to hunker down and and they're you know they're going to double down it's human nature that all that stuff happens\nWhich is why again I I think and this is not a justification for some of the rhetoric you get out of the president but\nI Do think that some of the grown ups in in perhaps the mainstream media would do well to kind of take a step back and say All right are we\nLeBron James has gone they get off to a rocky start their own six\nBut they fired him Cavaliers fired the guy you know it's like okay you want to talk about what have you done for me lately now I mean you don't have to be too upset with him because he's midway through a five year thirty five million dollar contract and the way that works is he gets paid regardless so it's it's not like\nIt's always funny what people have contracts you get I think they should fire so and so er what I Want to see you lose your job and kind of say well you've got a contract so you could fire and but if if you want to\nSecond really hurt him because he's he's gonna get paid ... regardless but I mean you just want to talk about a brutal business dynasty to go up to a bad start but man talk about like a short leash okay I I Know Steve ... feet he talked about this briefly last week but I I Want to kind of double back because it is part of my life\nHalloween is is tomorrow\nBut already already it's not just that there are Christmas decorations out there because there are a good a lot of stores and they're they're still now everybody's switching over to Christmas don't you know forget about you know waiting for Thanksgiving now I mean you've got all the different Christmas decorations but that's not what I Want to talk about\n'em in the category of I Would say sometimes women are from Venus and men are from Mars or whatever but this is this is more than that my my wife will tell you\nIf you were to ask her what sports is just like to watch when they're on TV\nShe would say it doesn't matter as long as it's sports just watch it it could be Irish curling and if it's on ... we'll we'll watch it and you could say to me with this friend like to watch and there there's there's two words have come to mind hallmark channel she's she's just\nShe loves the homework chance\nAnd what for those of you who aren't familiar with with the hallmark channel it is incredibly popular particularly among women but there's a lot of men that like it as well and what they do every Christmas season and the Christmas season for homework starts it started last Saturday October twenty seventh\nEvery year they make a bunch of movies\nSpecifically related to Christmas that they roll out over the Christmas season and then show over and over again I say a bunch of different movies but the truth is they're really the same movie now they might have different people in them and the characters might have different names but essentially the plot of homework movie goes something like this you have\n[noise] and and the the genders will switch around but you have\nThe highly successful woman working in the big city who comes back home and then falls in love with a falls back in love with the ex boyfriend\nWho's struggling to make his reindeer business work in in Christmas down or the story might be you've got a boy who works for the the big company looking to buy up some Christmas hotel in small town and he gets sent out to the town to make the deal\nMeets the girl who's running was struggling hotel or maybe it's her father that's running struggling hotel girl doesn't know that boy is from the the big city trying to buy it out they fall in love misunderstandings they all get together at the end I mean it it and it's pretty much all variations of those\nAnd they all get together at the end I mean it it's and it's pretty much all variations of those there's a very famous hallmark channel drinking show drinking game that you can play like every time they say Christmas carol you take a shot every time you see somebody in a Santa hat you take a shot every time you see a raging you're taking shots you you can you know you you can get blasted really quick\nBut the hallmark channel is rolled out their series of movies and um our friend Matt Miller genes son who who writes from Milwaukee dot com he's got a piece categorizing the these are the different movies to hallmark is rolling out between now and Christmas\nOr producer grew is look at these are the titles\nChristmas temporarily manner Christmas joy road to Christmas marrying father Christmas it's Christmas Eve\nThat's a a soldier's Christmas Christmas at Graceland a

around the clock small town Christmas Christmas made to order Christmas bells are ringing win calls to heart Christmas and focus on love okay\nThese are all movies that are going to be rolling out once a week or sometimes twice or three times a week between now and Christmas and then\nThey will be shown over and over and over and over and over again I Know because I Will watch them because my wife will watch them in bed which means if I Want to sleep in the same bed I'm going to never really watched them I Will go to sleep\nWatching these hallmark movies and and I did I kind of some points I kind of get fascinated and a lot of the actors are actors and actresses are\nThere you you kind of seen them like like soap operas or like it's in the movies and stuff like that where I Know that person from but it it's it's one Christmas movie after another now maybe you're listening to me and you say Geoff\nThis sounds incredibly silly you mean I Can't believe they've got all these movies I Will tell you the hallmark channel during Christmas for these movies may very well\nNon sports non live action sports these may be the this might be the most watched cable channel um I'm certainly among women and and also perhaps among men over the next several months this is a formula that is an incredible winner\nAnd I admit that I mean they're they're harmless fun I get it there\nYou know we there's so much bad stuff that goes on the world in the world\nIt's just it's kind of senseless fun escapism because the plots are kind of all the same\nYou could figure out where they're going but you know what I mean you know it's going to have a happy ending you're not gonna have to worry that you know bad stuff is going to happen you know the Christmas Town will be saved you know the boy will get the girl is a girl will get the boy\nIt it's kind of a good feel good thing I understand why these are so popular for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that you see I get a mortgage talk and ...\nAll right fans of the hallmark channel\nLet's do a segment about this these are the Christmas movies that are coming out there\nDo you get it do you love it do you look forward to this\nI Will tell you my wife is in this cat and then by the way then after they run these Christmas movies\nThey they kind of put them away for a little bit and then they show some in the summer um but this is a big deal is a big time are you are you a fan of the hallmark channel is this your favorite time of year and what is the what is the appeal of all these different type of movies which I take it for me\nThere all the same movie there might be different people but essentially they're all the same movie but it doesn't but people don't get tired of them for one for seven nine nine once explained

Wayne let's begin with some of the news is raking today Thai Montgomery has been traded hot Clinton Dix has been traded let's start with time Montgomery a so the game and I thought you did a nice job summarizing it on\nThe play by play over the past weekend time Montgomery runs a kick out of the end zone he fumbled the ball that kind of seals the deal and that loss for the Packers and then afterwards\nOr his teammates some of them apparently said that they think it was a selfish play comes out that maybe the coach instructed them explicitly don't do this he's traded today was this\nKind of a foregone conclusion that he would not be on the Packers for long after what happened over the weekend well\nOr certainly the residual of what was going on behind the scenes had a lot to do with it I'm sure um I don't know for a fact that it has a faith was sealed once he returned that kick out of the end zone I Do know coaching staff told him if the balls in the end zone don't return it and I think that the um the rams side\nUm you know the kickoff they wanted it in place so that the Packers would have to return it and uh take some time off the clock to kick or got a little bit too much of it ... it a little bit too much of it if it did get into the end zone by about a yard and a half two yards but\nUm you know tie made that decision and it was costly for the team and eventually closely for him\nWait who do you believe is in line to return kicked for the Packers\nWell I think they'll probably I'd be surprised if they didn't bring up Trevor Davis now and put them back there for ... um you know he did an excellent job over the last couple of years doing that he's on the injured reserve list he's one of two players that they have two moves off the injured preserve list they haven't used any yet they should be able to use one this week if they need to\nUh that's the bigger question is who's going to play safety [noise]\nYeah it was going to ask you about that every time I look at a trade or somebody being moved I often wonder who's a suitable replacement and does it make the team better I think there are some replacement options here for the kick returned spot obviously the running back to the waste and I think is stable with ... Williams\nI I don't know that the Packers got better by reading Huck quitting Dick but it is clear they weren't going to sign him after this season so they've got something but who are the candidates here and and will it be suitable it up\nWell obvious candidates would be Josh Jones who's a safety and raven green who's the safety rating brings a rookie free agent Josh is the second round wrapped choice but the guy who's playing more and more and he was taking steps away from ... control Bryce who will probably see more time in the field now that he has in recent weeks\nIs germane Whitehead who's been Joel Wit told me a couple of weeks ago he said he's the smartest football player he's been around since Charles woods and now he does not have Charles woods ins ability don't get me wrong but\nThe fact is a kid knows with the parents are like a glove he's been playing kind of a cornerback linebacker type of hybrid roll it wouldn't surprise me if he and control Bryson some combination of Josh Jones eventually in there at that safety position others have felt that maybe they can be drawn Williams back there I I don't know if I buy\nThat well it seems like it hot nothing else you have three picks that he was playing well it seemed to be and when you have your pair of young safety is is that is that a tricky thing to to work with the way they at least you had experience with ha ha there's not a lot of experience with the other guys\nYeah you know it can be there's no doubt about that I mean\nYour safety is your last line of defense but how was in in ... well at times he wasn't a very good tax or let me put it that way and there were things that happened to certainly the end of the Detroit game last year that that really soured things up for him and I think that ... they knew they weren't going to sign him next year so they're they're moving on\nI'm going to be a problem have young safety short to be a problem youth anywhere Greg is a problem I mean let's be honest this is the NFL this is in college football this is a man's experience was mostly\nAs a man's league you've got that right that's Wayne Larrivee the voice of the Packers way we'll have have any on thank you so much\nAre you guys have a great day it's a man's league history twenty six the WTO O.

a corner in a little\nBall let me ask you about that because there's there's a parallel to be made here you are behind significantly in the months leading up to the election do you feel that same sentiment in our state when you think about the current US Senate race\nIs very comparable and I have a hard time believing they're going to be very many Scott Walker and Tammy Baldwin voters and again I you know Scott Walker should be reelected easily uh it's probably a tight race or it shouldn't be this tight but I think if he wins I think we've got a very good chance to me she was right there she should be\nRewarded also with helping turn the state around and you know she's a mom and there is somebody who cares that that's what Wisconsin nice wanting and they're lucky to officials

Bush Rocco bomber now Donald Trump\nAnytime there's a midterm election right after the the first time the president's elected there's always a challenge for the party or an office at the time so it's all these historical facts all these other things we just believe though in the end if we get the facts out if you know people notice Scott Walker dot com and see the details there we get the facts out right on line or when the election\nI Want to ask you about your father your father passed away recently I Know he was a role model for you he was a mentor for you he was involved in what you did for a living what would your preacher father think what did he think about the state of discourse in the state of debate that we currently have in politics in Wisconsin\nWell I think bodes well and they are good in the world really I mean it's one of the challenges I think it's more than just last year's even with social media is on and said I think that's one of the challenges as great as it is to stay connected at all so people tend to say and do things they would never say in person that they'll say on Twitter or Facebook or other anybody right outside of politics or not\nBut I think that's just my dad but my mom I'm One of the things I'm most appreciative of from my parents\nIs they taught us to look out for other people ah they taught us to stand up for what we believe as we definitely do that we do that and I've tried to do with her son but they also taught us to respect people respect people regardless of their beliefs when there's political religious or otherwise and that's the biggest thing missing and I think it's something we need\nYou know respect to something we all need involved in but it starts at home and starts not just talking about the modeling and turn it and I've tried to do that with Matt and Alex our two sons\nGovernor Walker you mentioned in previous interview is that if we elected governor ... third term it would be your last\nThe term it would be your last why three terms for the limit for you and when dishes do you have after that potential\nTurned denial Africa for like ... will be happy just to get past that yeah we are not know what the future might help but really for us ... we really did talk and pray a lot about this\nYou know first one was all about jobs current term now more people working ever before really focused on educating and training the workforce is why we put for example more money in the schools that are before it wasn't just for students' success was because every day I hear from employers say I got jobs they just need people to fill those jobs\nAnd now it's on the third time I just want to grow I Want to finish the job off I Want to finish what we started together and grow the workforce that means keeping are graduates here that means making sure every student graduates\nAnd that means attracting new people and we we've been out recruiting millennials from across the Midwest we've been out bringing alumni back on what the coolest things we're doing is actually going to sixty different military bases\nTo recruit active duty military personnel and their families about to retire or the number one state in America for veterans benefits so that for me is really kind of finishing the job off we've talked about uh twelve years enough time to do anything and then who knows what God's got plans for both of us after that\nGovernor Scott Walker and first lady to net Walker with us in Studio ... tonight I Want to ask you about the campaign candidate dove tail and what I what I asked the governor about\nHow tough is the campaign on you how does a campaign on your children when it's nasty it's it's been\nYeah it's it's a hard it's I think it is the worst campaign that we've ever tend to and people will say even compared to the recall and I I have to admit the recall is bad but somehow it just doesn't seem as bad as it is because of all of that\nNews and Twitter and treat than that you know all that I'm sure it was around when we were going to act\nCan but I don't I don't remember it but it's it's been tough and and you know we're tough we've always been tough you know we tend to just before cell um it'll be glad when itself very I'll be glad when it down there and I think athletes will be killed\nThe good news is there's probably want to know about ten times more example people regardless of their party or or the political beliefs are just good decent people and they can disagree with you in some cases but overall the good news is there's many more positive stories and stories like\nThat so governor do you ever do you take your elbow and kind of say come on and tell you one of us are you looking at me like when I look out now and serious when we\nGot up and we were walking away they were actually marching down the street already with their gong they love their little dawn in Madison cell I was like yeah I'm going home so that I Want\nTo ask you about something you're very passionate about I'm In that trauma informed carrying he's been very vocal about that Milwaukee is one of those cities that suffered greatly from childhood trauma what is currently being done around the state to raise awareness about toxic stress stress an adverse childhood experiences yes there are so\nMany good things being done and trauma informed care it's really a movement all over the country so it's nice to see this really moving forward and we've been active since Scott and I've been at this together since ... eleven and\nWe've been fortunate enough to be able to um train seven state agencies and trauma informed care which is really key to the way that we are going to look and treat children and families as we move forward in in um Wisconsin and so um I Know that this year about six months ago the Marquette University got involved which is going to be huge\nObviously the levels can really move the needle and trauma and find care but you know first gotten I no matter what happens and she would say\nUm it's not going away yeah right that's going to be hashed out it's not going away I've been able to have a resolution in the Senate and in the house in in a federal government we've been able to do that we've been able to\nReally kind of just bring awareness\nTo something that's so simple right\nYou have under Scott Walker and first lady to that Walker with us in Studio governor in recent months a handful of your former cabinet secretaries have had not very nice things to say about you what is your reaction to once trusted advisors Breaking Bad on your right before the election\nYou know the interesting thing about this is that I for years even when I was here at the county put a pretty diverse group of people together and so I have people that don't always share my political player so I have a I had a cabinet member for some time it was a strong advocate for a fairly large increase in the ... in the gas tax\nUh but I made a prejudice pledge to the voters years ago I was going to raise their role tax burden and so I kept that promise but he was an advocate for that I didn't booed him out because of that uh you know that was ... I think it's helpful to have a diverse set of ...\nYears ago actually had a staffer with me four years ago who work for Joe Lieberman of course ran with Al Gore back in two thousand into the county had a lot of folks who worked for Democrats and the best I think it's healthy to have a variety of different opinions out there\nI I guess I Would just ask the voters as they make their decision between now and Tuesday or to look now at the facts to look at our results because more people working there for eight consecutive months\nA record low unemployment more this last budget more invested in public education than ever before in the history of the state in terms of actual dollars and\nEven Tony ... or opponent called that are broken budget so you look on issue after issue after issue and we got a gay but we were not satisfied with just where we're at we've got a plan to connect more students to careers to keep our graduate you're in the states and simple things like\nKeeping any graduate a two year for two years or more college or university and we wanna give them five thousand dollars in tax credits as they say and work in the state of Wisconsin for the next five years good things happening on the horizon\nWell did you serve a full term unequivocally if you're reelected how you'll be here for for\nUs for years and this is a is a question was asked before this will be our last term but we plan on being here the whole time\nI Love being governor that's one of the things I learned the last several years more than anything is that there is no better job in America particularly in the American government than being a governor you can get real things done for people every single day so I Love traveling the state\nYou know my bonus loved attacked me on that too I don't apologize I I Love being here market but I Love being in America and and superior in Hudson where I was just at the other day I I think people want to see their elected officials either governor\nJeanette do you like to campaign or is it a necessary evil\nI don't I don't say that I like to campaign but when I left behind at home\nThen I'm like worried about like what's going on so I'm kind of like I Want to go but I don't want to go and so I'll stay home a few days and then go a few days and I have to take a break I couldn't I could never do you it's got this from morning 'til night I I like I have a limited and he knows what my limit is and then I'm done you know it\nBut one of the things that you you said this beforehand that you like the people yeah just the ... the day in and day out long hours and that but the people around the state or wondering\nYeah they're great that that is yeah I Would have to admit that that is one of the great things\nOne of the perks you heard a little further and so on Saturday Night we were one of her last stuff's was ... going to drive to also it's the overnight we've got about two hundred people at a wall places a bowling alley it was a I think it was national American beer day and so we looked at each other and we said we're going to sample\nAnd so we all the French used the Internet or she's a ... you know whether we watch a couple of beers we had a basket to choose Kurds and and we had a disco ball right of our land so uh you can't make it as\nThe as Governor Scott Walker and first lady tone that Walker thank you so much for spending some time with us ex or pleasure good to be with you or we have as Tony Evers to join us as well in the studio have not heard back on that it is for twenty four WGM Jay let's to news about your money is Matthew tested with a WTO O.
