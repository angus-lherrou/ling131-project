Packers kind of getting lost in all the brewers talk and brewers excitement I think\nYou know I think they are a little bit and I think Packer fans maybe appreciate that 'cause they're kind of anxious about the Packers unhappy about the birds so it'd be a tough tough stretch\nRight now they only have the Packers to think about\n... what's the feeling up north it out to ... specially after last Sunday's game are they forgiving amazing crappy\nAnd some are some not so much um I I think they're just anxious to see what's gonna happen next and whether they'll get it together\nRich rhyme in Green Bay press Gazette with us on WGM Jay which I enjoy your work because you take us away from the actors and knows a little bit the title town district is very exciting for all of Wisconsin and they're actually some new developments when we talk about the title Tom district what are some of the newer things that are happening with that piece of property\nWhile the Packers around uh finally because we'd been waiting for for a while I'm there plans to build a how how the an apartment\nA end up at the title pound district so they're going to build a about a hundred and fifty unit apartment building and Seventy to Ninety townhouses or on the property and it'll be overlooking the part part of that\nAnd have used down toward a limbo field at the other end\nAnd people have been pretty excited about that than they first announced the title home plans are about three years ago and now they can finally started to sign up to uh uh get their name on the list to see if they want to live

is one of the few that still remaining there my old house be long commute if I still live there or they done buying property or they done expanding over there I mean the Packers\nWell I my personal opinion is they're probably not but I don't think they're going to be doing anything uh soon they they've got a lot to deal with just finishing off the pirate titled pound that they've got now\nBut their future plans that they haven't said what they're going to do but they do own Bella down at the other end of on Marty and they own the land across the street from that and they don't own a

Curtis Granderson the cage you veteran Hey Greg\nHey I'll give you that love Curtis Granderson John Curtis thanks for joining us manage it crazy what difference a year make a year ago you were playing with the teams that you know facing the Dodgers probably the way the world series Frank\nIs a crazy part about baseball you know growing up watching it you always saw guys play with the team for ten Fifteen Twenty years and now you know you're likely to see a guy play with a team for a year so you know a lot of switching and then guys moving teams which makes a lot of fun here has\nMoved through the stages of the play offs here Curtis anything ... is there a mentality you sort of shift at all or is it is with all of that you do or die kind of\nAtmosphere still got to be exact same way you know you're in a situation where you've got to try to win a series invokes you trying to do that right now we've been doing that for a good part of the last months here hopefully continue to keep a thing going but certainly his first came here at Miller Park and I\nWill be celebrations have been a lot of fog would it be cool to do one actually at Miller Park you know\nWe don't mind where we do as long as we get a chance to celebrate you know and hopefully the fans are with this whether they're in the stadium or they're traveling on the road like they'd been doing so well up to this point or you know watching it on TV you know the fan base has been amazing you know hopefully no matter where we get a chance to celebrate everybody's a part of\nIt I don't think there's any ... in the ... knows the Dodgers better than you what sort of resource of event for the rest of the guys\nYou know what I tried my best to bring as much information as I can to these guys but again it's been a year so a lot of things have changed you know with that organization I was only there for a little bit but I myself have ... you know by plane was shot over there we're trying our best to provide as much influence we chance but they're also doing the same thing I'm sure the Dodgers and organization from what I remember being with them\nWhat their advance scouting and their pro scouting you're trying to figure out what our game plan is actually going to be over the course of the series for the\nGreater good joining us on this program Curtis you also do a lot about Clinton courage saw tonight starter what is it about him that that makes them\nSo it's a challenging at fast you know what he's a tendency to address is also very confident and wants to ball DVD definitely going to come at you and you have to really good approach\nAnd get each individual ... doesn't necessarily pitch to teach the batter was going to be a battle you know fatter and fatter\nSorry better get Fisher Fisher bad every time to go up there and these guys are facing quite a bit of time but obviously you know there's nothing really you can do to prepare for guy like her car shows done\nThe course of his career is a lot of luck to you you're going to take them out for the Dodgers what sort of challenges to present serves of practical lie to\nYou know for so far I think I'm a couch has done a really good job of just letting guys know that they may play in this situation they may not play in that situation but outline of hasn't had too many changes you know for the most part no matter who the starter has been for the last couple of weeks the life is pretty consistent except for some of the middle and feel there's there\nBut I think you know the fact that you have the ability to mix and match out there like to do with our senior Sharm\nStock is sir scope you out there and I give it a lot of uh\nOptions for council go out there and say okay well we'll try this one we can do that one but I still feel just competing\nIf it in a row so how do you make sure that none of the ... states are\nPros and cons of having days off everybody obviously looks to give up you know a guy who bumps and bruises doing a hundred and sixty two plus the postseason you look forward to getting a chance to give some rock at the same time was baseball\nUh you don't necessarily get consistent days off except for the all star break so playing on a day to day basis or something that you definitely want to do a good thing both us and a dog in a very similar situation they've only had one left they often are so\nYou know we're both from the very similar situation trying to stay hot remain hot come off the gates hot\nYou know so it's going to be a battle over who can actually executed do it and continue to keep their house street growth\nField advantage is hoping to get is that here up until the world series [noise]\nYou can't buy experiences like that when a family is a family in everybody's enjoying each other

let's go live inside Miller parks too much this year how much do you do about it\n[noise] um [noise] you know\nIt's he he's not a secret I guess we we we faced in last year um you know what the video it's there's we know plenty about um um\nSo it's you know he's he's obviously got not as ... as a um you know he's had some injury issues this year um he was a you know a highly talented player I'm coming into last last season [noise]\nUm so it's you know ... player we feel comfortable with I Would say oh I think there's plenty of information I'm going to go on with a guy like areas you\nStart growing your left to do a reflect a little bit obviously ... an all time great pitcher could you talk about what's your most about him\nUm [noise] well I mean we you know as\nAs a people who compete in the game and and watch the game I think\nWe all admire um longevity of excellence you know I think guys that can maintain a high level of performance for for a long time um you know it's certainly something to a\nWorld where everybody's impressed by that because it's not easy to to last in the game and and pitch at the level he has for for this long so I'm not an old old ... old player by any means but um he's he's been\nPutting together a nice seasons for quite a long time\nAnd had them in the correct one more on the roster I'm In deciding not to add a Davies or an aunt or something like a traditional starting pitcher\nIs it safe to say you're basically are confident in the guys who made starts for you but maybe knock down the stretch that they're so stretched out enough to deliver the innings need to cover this was there any debate about whether you had enough innings and those guys [noise]\nYeah we we you know I think that innings you know the innings we talked about for sure um\nYou know what we're going to share the innings you know it it's going to be um um you know I think you saw in division series kind of how the final tally of innings were divided um I think it'll look you know very similar at at the end of this series and\nYou'll have to add a junior in and Freddie into that next of guys that have 'em and Xavier and the guys that are adding adults but I think you you won't see a of a player that's kind of way ahead as in terms of how many algae got for us in the series and and that's how we think um\nYou know we recover the uh the twenty seven hours a day

the major league level in and help us win games we saw that throughout the month of September\nI think we're going to see it continues throughout the playoffs in how we deploy a roster and an

TMZ any\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell I Will say that\nI'm very and very very whatever they shine every moment for me [noise] flying I enjoy [noise]\nAbsolutely Jenny appreciate that you know I talked to a couple of guys in the clubhouse earlier today and a couple of yesterday and you know it the the voice of writer right I mean there there's more national media had no one part today than I'd ever seen at Miller Park and and that comes with the territory of playing in the playoffs it also comes\nWith the territory of calling it the might the Dodgers from the one of the largest media markets in the world they all eyes are on Milwaukee tonight there is no other game to divide attention so yes so the lights are brighter but if if it doesn't seem to affect this brewers team it it's\nIt's the same it's the same club house that I walked into in San Diego at the end of march\nIs the same club house that I walked into middle of a losing streak in July\n... here tonight I mean there's no difference either really is no difference I mean you guys are that don't get me wrong there that they're ready they've been able to sleep in their own beds days off it's being spun as positive inside the brewers clubhouse why would you spit it out of the other way\nAnd it is about it's only been because it's a good point at the end of the month disease will be over\nAnd if the brewers are the last team standing awesome it'll be a wild celebration\nBut by the end of this month that's it that's all for baseball\nUntil spring training\nSoak it in pro is in surgeon bay on WGM Jay ...\nHey Greg how you doing tonight\n[noise] great looking forward to the game of rent\nNext couple of days are my comments on the uh\nSeries is you know I think it's going to go six or seven for sure I really I think we're gonna have to beat the Dodgers I think the Dodgers are good enough you don't really give their\nTheir starting pitching an edge here but you know as much as I disagree with some\nKinds of things come for everything that he's doing is working and I hope it continues because it's making Sunday afternoons and this year this week Monday Night a lot easier to forget it might show with that uh you know let's let's enjoy the series and hopefully\nWe uh we we put up a bit competitive or run and and make that national news people realize that these guys really did have a special either and you know let's go to a credit and enjoy it will take care and we'll talk so\nYeah ... you know I think Troy is in the same boat as a lot of rivers fans and you know just it's been an unusual way\nTo go about the seasons away Craig ... manages the bullpen his starters and I I Know we're all used to watching started there were seven or eight innings and and finish what they started if you want to go back to the eighties or what not\nSo different games so I think it's been an evolution fans have evolved and are now starting to realize what great council has done the boy it's his work it's it's led the team to this point\nNo I think that the national media some of the old school broadcasters that may or may not be doing these brewers games\nThis might be even new new to them you know I think the ... ds was kind of an eye opener to some in that uh they didn't get it they just seemed like they weren't used to what the brewers we're doing because it's unique it's unique the Dodgers that they can afford to have a thirty nine thirty five billion dollar per year starting pitcher\nI don't think the brewers will ever be in that category but they've got a bunch of great relievers have good starters who are provided value to the team\nAnd the one Ninety six regular season games if you include game one sixty three so\nIt's a different style it's unique I think fans have evolved\nIdea to evolve as well just it it was different and unique and interesting\nBut I'm at the point now that business way for a couple of months I'm just fascinated I'm fascinated to see what's going to happen next quake council managed again one of the end LDS in effect heavier designated hitter the picture it ever hits you just if it was remarkable it all works to plan\nAnd thankfully the one that came a little hiccup and then I did what they were able to absorb it and when so hey enjoy this up because I Am curious to see who's going to start from gave the game as I Am who's going to pitch second when they're going to come in and where are the brewers and the wind up when that happens\nAnalytics numbers match ups is trumping gut feel and let the brewers to game on
