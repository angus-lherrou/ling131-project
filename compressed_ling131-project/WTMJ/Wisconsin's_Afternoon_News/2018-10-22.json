going to get the money to improve the the roads are to do the work that we need to be done and do road building\nSome people want to see massive increases in the gasoline tax other people think toll roads would be a good idea some people like me think that there's a lot of fat in the deal the budget and a lot of a lot of the ways that we did things there's a lot of waste involving\nFor example the road builders and we start by eliminating that\nBut but reasonable people can disagree the state gas tax in Wisconsin has been frozen at about thirty three cents a gallon\nFor several years the federal gas tax has been frozen at Eighteen cents a gallon since Nineteen Ninety three so in Wisconsin we essentially pay around fifty or fifty one cents per gallon a A N tax\nPer gallon of gasoline that this purchased\nOne of the interesting things now is that you have more and more cars they'd get increased gas mileage\nSo they need less gas to to go farther you also have electric cars and you have the hybrid cars did go further and further on less gasoline so at the same time you're increasing wrote in Egypt cars to get more mileage in some parts of need almost no gasoline at all\nWhich means that if you're driving for example a hybrid yes you're you're paying your registration fees but you're not essentially paying very much and the gas tax one of the ideas that is being floated there was a big piece in the Chicago Tribune about this\nAnd this is becoming an issue in Chicago governor's race\nOne of the ideas is let's scrap the gas tax let's get rid of the gas tax altogether\nWhat do they suggest replacing it with\nStart charging drivers by the mile and I guess there's all sorts of different ways that you could work this out but in theory\nIn theory in a

NFL so what they're doing\nIs they get teams out of their game plan of early everybody wants to run the ball and get out in the past feeds off the run and vice versa\nWell against the rams you can't stay with the wrong because they score at will so teams are getting out of their game plan earlier in having to pass the ball consequently the facts numbers are rising for the rams they're able to St guys back in coverage that they make wife very difficult\nBut sock helps a little bit Greg I'm going to start with Aaron Rodgers and no doubt about it a week ten days off is going to help him be a little bit healthier could we maybe see him more mobile is this is sort of injury where if he doesn't get deemed a lot he could eventually get better through the course of the season\n[noise] yeah I think that kind of remains to be the end I think it depends on how he falls in you know how he fit and how the nearest contorted\nThe bracing to be helping him it aired his look mobile enough certainly mobile enough to play I'm I'm not inside your body so I don't know what the paint tolerance is but yeah you imagine the time off a very helpful for Rogers that I Would expect when the pads go on for practice later this week\nThat he'll be involved as they get ready to take on the rams or the other things on the team is going to leave on friday a set of on Saturday the travel schedule here the next few weeks you outlined it\nIt it's pretty significant they go out to LA they come back home then they go out to New England they're going to be in Seattle that a few weeks I'm living in the Midwest can be beneficial sometimes with travel but nonetheless that's a that's a lot of mild being put on by the team at a short amount of time\nYou know Greg those receivers have not been healthy either demand to Adams has been banged up by a cabin journal Alison didn't even play the last game or so or they should be healthier and more at full strength is well\nWell I'm hoping so we'll find out a little more later this week uh you know they're they're both dealing with some kind of nagging give juries elephants cleared the concussion protocol that really wasn't the thing that helped him back there was more of a soft tissue injury leave with rental car but\nYou know ... days off a couple of weeks off really is what causes had you'd like to think that this needs to be back and very close to full freight\nGoing into what you could easily says they're most challenging threats of four or five weeks on the entire schedule\nI loved his team Greg but at times I'm just genuinely surprised at how bad they are in certain scenarios in certain situations if this team didn't have Aaron Rodgers how bad would it be middle of the NFL or lower tier\n... yeah I think he's ... season you know that this is not a playoff game without Aaron Rodgers idol thing\nNow the other thing that you've noticed around watching the NFL or the bears have a good defense what happened yesterday they give a thirty eight points good defenses around the league are giving up points rules favor the ... it is very difficult to be a stout defensive team weekend and week out in this league and the Packers are just sort of okay on defense\nBut they don't have a fast in stopping the rams in my opinion the rams are gonna score their average does go over thirty points a game the question is can they keep up and you know used to be more you get to one of these ... games and boy they are in Rogers against your guy as well take Aaron Rodgers but even the ... it's been kind of clunky of getting going and\nForced out of their game plan or by the opposition able to score somebody points early on\nBut by the opposition able to score somebody boys early on so that you got to keep this ain't tight as far as possible in my opinion to try to stay within the confines of your game plan in seven instead of having to have ever loggers brought back fifty two times in a bad knee\nIt's brewers

somewhat ambiguous is the terms of David Stern contract some people believe there's another year left we were never really told how long term deal it was when David Theroux was brought on or what the the numbers were the dollar figure is behind it\nOr anything like that the bonus structure who don't\nSo that remains to me a in a gray area\nIn my conversations with David Stern he is very very pleased in Milwaukee and not only with the job but you've got now got a daughter in the mix a very young daughter born a less than a month ago so he's involved in her life and his wife and I bought a house I mean they have\nThey have started to show that they're going to you know put down roots in Milwaukee I never want to say never to anybody and moving anywhere uh especially in the case of David Stern where he may have an opportunity to be closer to family a with a young child to the mix that might be appealing I I don't know\nI Do know that David turns loves Milwaukee and I do know that he loves his job\nAnd what he's done with the brewers is remarkable I mean he has built significant trusted equity and not only with the fan base here but what the players on this roster of everybody of great things to say about David Stern them and how could you not I think he's going to be the executive the year in major league baseball I I think we're printing that way\nAnd part of the reason why he's done such a great job is controlled spending while adding talent\nAnd it's worked it paid off you'll leave shots\nAnd it's worth it paid off you'll leaves are seen as like the shining example of that while teams were overpaying while guys like me\nOn the program back in March and April and think boy I think it's just it's a little white pitching still seems a little light you got to go find a

say standards to become trade opportunities because of a stack field in the outfield and in the rotation\nDecisions so many big decisions that will be made here this off season\nBut you know you've got a core of players coming back so this does not feel like the back of two thousand eight you knew you weren't going to have the easiest about the for the long term it became clear that are having Prince Fielder for the long term well that was going to be awfully difficult [noise]\nAnd that kind of felt like well they just make hay while the sun is shining\nAll of a sudden the sun sets the

something like that I don't know but if she's having a socialist rally currently British Sanders of course will be in town as well other famous us a socialist funded with politics All right I'm going to shift gears completely\nAnd I wanted to talk about this last friday but we have the brewers a broadcast from the tailgate is six twenty W teams in mobile studio um which was fun but as we speak there's like now seven thousand migrants moving up through\nMexico border city of a few that has dogged bill and there's another keeps getting larger and larger and larger and they're they're awesome and mission is to get to the United states and I and I love the fact that he wants to come in I'd say the greatest country on earth\n\nBut this is the second time now that we've had this storyline\nAnd I even Mexico officials are frustrated by the process they don't know what to do with these people and they they've had him since then they've kept him out and and because these people really want to get through Mexico the United states they're crossing rivers are doing they're climbing fences\nAnd they're doing whatever they can to make that uh that track now the amazing thing about this was a couple of amazing things they have thousands of miles to reverse before they get from where the rats to the U.S border with Mexico\n\nThat's a lot of miles to walk the Mexican officials to their credit are trying to help elderly people children women some of them are pregnant deal with the realities of life in those conditions\nSome of the some of the people had actually turned back and headed home because it's it just was so tough and why why is this happening or a couple of reasons one these people are facing violence in their home countries in South America Central America\nExtreme poverty because their governments have frankly screwed them up\nDon't provide for their own people not doing what the government should do in its in its most basic sense how those people that need help that's the proper role of government not to do everything but to do the right thing\nBut the other side of this is something that has become a political talking point\nAnd it demonstrates a lousy include the frustration a lot of us have when it comes to talking about immigration\nThe border with Mexico and why Republicans and Democrats have messed Tibet on this issue for so long\nNo clear immigration policy at least one that addresses this issue now you can think that it's great that people want to come here you can be one of those people the things we our border with Mexico should just be open and we should open arms and except for everybody but that's not possible\nWe can't do that\nAre limits to what we can do as a country and even the policy that we do have in place\n\nThere are limits to what we can do as a country and even if the policy that we do have in place which is flawed outdated and frankly hurts the process has limits on other countries Canada\nOther countries in Europe are actively looking to update their immigration policy to deal with these types of issues because border crossings are happening all over the world because people are skipping violence in the middle east or violence in South America Central America that's the reality of the world we live in but we can't take everybody in\n\nAnd we're spending lots of lots of money trying to resolve this\nFor one for seven nine nine one six point of view I can emerge and stopping touched one what should our government's reaction be to seven thousand or five thousand humor or migrants trying to get to the United states what should we be doing\n\nOr should it be open arms spend as much money to improve their lives it sounds so great and the fairy tale world of Tammy Baldwin that sounds so comfortable and reassuring\nBut it's not the reality of the world we live in there are challenges to these problems because Republicans and Democrats haven't come up with a consistent clear enforceable immigration policy where at where we're apt\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty it's frustrating to me and a lot of different levels because I've been talking about this issue for almost two years\nI've had US Senators on the show congresspeople who said yeah we want to get to a solution\nAnd they all have their own ideas but they don't ever get to a solution\nOne of the Senate Canada\n... two six to line up our military on the board and close the border the president has threatened dance\n\nWhich would mean extreme\nPosition given there's an election coming up in a couple of weeks\nAnd I know that Democrats would seize on that opportunity because that's what they do to portray this as another example\nOf how Republicans are evil and racist and whatever other turn you want to use when they're not really they're trying to provide some balance to a very difficult problem immigration border enforcement as one of the fundamental issues that face as our country right now and for the most part\nRepublicans and Democrats have not resolved it and that's why we're at where we're at\nVery challenging times\nWhat would I Do the texture s\nI Would secure the border with military I Would do it as soon as possible because you cannot have a situation where thousands of people are streaming across that border in ways that they do it\nWithout hearing people are dying children are dying women are dying elderly are dying\nThere has to be border security and as it doesn't make anybody feel good that's the way you have to approach it I don't know what other solution there is given the challenges and the opportunity to do anything about it from a policy decision unfortunate times for those\n\nPeople coming trying to come across
