TI country\nSo this is an unusual sports day certainly a there could be a big brewers when which are obviously is being played right now in Denver, Colorado the Packers were the\nI mean let's be honest terrible last day thirty one twenty three got some thoughts I mentioned Crosby are coming up as well we'll take your phone calls a\nAds for one for seven and nine one six twenty that is the ac unit mortgage talk and text line and also touched them as well get some ah textures that are have chimed in in the last hour of Jeff ... program which just wrapped up here on that in four or five each country an up and down the Green Bay Packers radio network\nOr we will keep you informed as far as what is going on on the brewers a front as well and we've got much basketball tonight the bucks in Des Moines to take on the Minnesota ... NBA pre season and\nDawn the Minnesota timber wolves NBA preseason action a so again as we mentioned a couple of times during the week this was the first time in history that the Packers brewers and bucks we'll of all played on the same\nDay and what I think it's cool is that they're not playing at the same time so if you started your day with the Packers I can understand why that may have given you some ingestion\nBecause they didn't play well particularly in the first house and the second half things a little bit better but nation Crosby didn't and here's what I'll say about Mason Crosby he has kicked a lot of game winning feel goals for the Packers\nAnd I maintain that he will\nWin you far more games than he is going to lose you and I understand what might because he was doing at the end of the game just to try to give them one more shot the lead them feel like well OK it just was the worst day of Mason Cosby's career\nI mean is that he had his hips a few years ago but he and his four field goals and an extra point three feel goes in ... when he left and ten points out there today\nAnd with the last field goal attempt to fifty six year or not I'm not sure what Mike mccarthy was trying to do with that I I Know when he was trying to do he was trying to get some point she was trying to make it a one score game\nBut on a day where Mason Crosby has already missed everything that he's tried I don't know why you put 'em in that situation you're setting somebody up to fail and I and I didn't I didn't understand exactly why that was the situation\nThat Mason Crosby was put in the last of the game absolutely you get it it's a sign that book\nWe know what happened we acknowledge what happened it's terrible what happened today just get a kick and make it and feel like you can actually accomplish a field goal on this day of horrors for your career now social media being so what what what social media is\nSocial media was ready to roast nation Crosby at the stake and if you want to make the assertion today that Mason Crosby lost the Packers this game against the lines okay I I mean all entertain that [noise]\nUm I don't think that it's unfair he had and and I was accused of defending nation how can you defend Mason Crosby\nOn social media you're a kicker apologist somebody called me a kicker apologist today [noise] your check her apologist oh I don't know if I'm a kicker apologist or not I just take a long view of this and if you look at Mason Cosby's career in its entirety it's not that bad\nHad the ... a couple of years ago and had an awful day today nobody is defending the day that Mason Crosby had today it was terrible\nThat having been said have we not all had terrible days at work have we not all of us every single one of us had a day where just everything went wrong\nNow there's a couple of differences here Mason Cosby is paid a lot more than probably every one\nIs listening to the son of my voice right now he's a lot better than I Am he's paid a lot better than you are and the reason that he's paid as much as he is paid is to make those pressure kicks in front of sixty five thousand fans on national television with millions of eyes watching him get that that's OK time\nI get that you're right yes but again we not allowed one bad day\nAfter what Thirteen Years of success well OK twelve years he had that we have one bad year that one bad here\nBut after twelve Thirteen Years of success you're going to skewer a guy who's the Packers all time leading scorer who has been as reliable as just about any kick her in the NFL I I I Can't get behind that\nAgain it was a bad day it was a terrible day\nWhat can you do you just turn the page\nAnd you try to fix not only what's wrong with mentioned Cosby but you've got to fix what else is wrong with his team right now this team was life less in the first half they went down twenty four to nothing a halftime and then it was too little too late there was nothing that they could do to overcome that deficit\nAaron Rodgers has done super a Superman\nA heroic before in his career we saw it earlier the season in week one against the Chicago Bears the number of times that Aaron Rodgers has pulled this team Stan he's out of the collective fire\nYou could fill up volumes you could fill up maybe a case in Canton port obviously he's headed to the hall of fame but\nAlong with his championship right along with his two MBP awards\nI mean that's his legacy is\nCovering up towards on this Packers team but he couldn't necessarily cover up all of those words today I mean he threw the ball fifty two times because he was trying to get this team back\nCare for you know some of the things that we know we can do better so all of it to division games are so important soil for two two and one and we got work to do an extra day to get ready for San Francisco so questions [noise]\nHe saw me off or any kind of went on [noise] [noise]\nWell we'll just your work through things I'm just like any of the things that can go right today we'll we'll look at them all valley way to me will be better prepared for Monday Night\nCivil little slowly in three so far is there anything that you know\nI don't think that there's nothing like ... to one one common thread\nThat we would see on that one about uh what kind of what the hell\nOut of all when a lot of action no fault the ball hit Kevin I'm so all you had a challenge to get the reviews you know based on a you know let's not\nClassified as a turnover so [noise] um well I think they made the right call\nVote on too long and making the place\nI think he's fair [noise]\nWhile going into the game that you know they're seven or Thirteen sects of season where extended play so much for the\nIt's a philosophy or there's a room and they're going to there are three main Russians in certain situations and you'll give up more than ... you know to play coverage and and pleaded extended um play and and and well she would they're relying on his er rustling discipline and so as it's just really a\nChallenge uh we we feel we are very good in that area of accent or places that's that's all they choose to play it and I'm so\nThey're able to make two places I think they are and and the specific girl situation [noise]\nSalt purity going on around [noise]\nNo I don't think it's a problem for him I think it's really ... you know something as a football team is is a better we focus and um you know it's that's where we work on every day I'm not happy with our turnover racial ah I think anytime you new coach and his legal for a long period of time just are staying there there's common\nThreads that run through your successes a football team well ours has clearly been the turnover ratio and um that is not the case right now five five games and toward [noise]\nFor the a lot of good things about our young guys mates employers a bill they made some mistakes too so uh we'll look at that tomorrow and in in ... and grow from it but [noise] um I thought the rotation of all the coaches and\nPlayers are this forest where Walter came into the game but a little bit of the unknown and trying to manage that or early or would you know also when the getting up to her was do we kind of had to go so the thought I thought the young guys to good\nJournalism dollars or something else or else your music cleared it\nHere is not clear to the U.S [noise]\nOverall I think I was young receivers did you think that's part of a number\nOf years back they had gotten killed all those guys I thought there's a lot of good things up a good jobs rotation studies you know huge later at the end a lot like that I like what they gave us today and they made some mistakes you know we'll we'll look at that and learn from that in a you know we'll build off at\nLos pretty fill us in these\nCertain things are really was not ready yet and yet it\nIs about when I go I mean is it you know we we didn't do enough to win the day um [noise] we'll focus on the things one wrong that we can control and we had too many of those today\nAnd then is you know we we didn't do enough to win today um [noise] we'll focus on the things that were wrong that we can control than we have too many of those today\nHesitation sending me\nTo give you any hesitation said to me [laughter] [noise]\nNo it's ... that's the situation you're like more of the you know do you want to be normal troll there what I'm going to say when you get to the sport you want to make sure you do get a chance to win so\nYour team a chance to win some work in the field goal and you know some type of desperation play on the on so I took\nA live there was our last as a last chance\nShe still is a guy leaves you got your mom I'm such a young guy saw or something you saw a\nMatch you know we're not going to point the finger on young guy old guy you know ... we're we're we're not we're not good enough to her and also when it it'd be better\nPackers coach Mike mccarthy after today's loss at Detroit thirty one twenty three take a couple of more of your phone calls for one for seven nine one six twenty on the accident mortgage shock and text line\nGive you a

hour and that kind of timeframe who raises and call the valley dang I Am at the end of the\n[noise]\nAnother nearly sleepless night you're used to write you really ever get used to staring at the

Ninety four or five K. TI country ... rasa with you for just a couple more minutes jak hurts catches a touchdown pass from Carson when's anyway urge ten receptions for a hundred ten yards and that touchdown\nPhiladelphia's still trails at home to Minnesota twenty three Twenty one that is within minutes seven left to play in that game one final call you're an extra point before we send it off the bus basketball Mike is in Chicago\nHi Mike you're on a ... gauge yeah country\nYeah or like I just wish we could all be out in polo you respond to your point is I Can't I Can't get shot a Ninety four point six twenty but I just want to say I think\nI think they're getting worse by week week you may you may disagree or agree though the parks you shouldn't have stuck to really is what happened is football team and they really can't afford to get off shore starts the waiter he fetches play that subtle effects is very good whether it's going to be\nStuck in there that remains to be but I think it comes out of her head coach of coaching staff so a lot of this football team and I said before I don't think they're going to make the playoffs are really truly you know\nI I think Roger just plain totally fair is I think he's an average quarterback or no I Hope to God he gets better because dogs that doesn't bode\nWell yeah I certainly hope it gets better as well thanks for the call Mike I'm I'll I'll I Would say to that is\nThe Packers aren't playing very well right now they continue to play this way they won't get to the playoffs and Mike in Chicago is absolutely right as far as Aaron Rodgers the mediocre I I I I don't know that I Would ever say that I think that he's suffering from lack of joining Nelson I'm ... and I know that\nA ... look joining an air and haven't been that one two punch for a couple of years errands injury last year ... the year prior to that\nUm so we haven't seen them at their best for one against three seasons and now obviously ... he's in Oakland [noise] so I think Aaron Rodgers is suffering real suffering a little bit from that um there's not a lot of depth at wide receiver right now or at least not a lot of experience as well as slow starts they are a problem and if they continue to be a problem at some point\nI'm not calling for Mike mccarthy to lose his job or anything like that because there's still a lot of season left to be played but I think that it is fair to evaluate everyone on every coaching staff after every season no matter how successful you are or aren't and when you have missed opportunities sometimes changes\nAre made to Thompson for example was one of those changes that was made last year by that will do it for this edition of the extra point presented by ... hotel and casino I'm Doug Russell thanks to you for listening thanks to Ashton Rashed Rahman super producer on the other side of the glass\nAnd ultimately that benefits all of us so there's a lot of excitement and walk in this new building to look at an east coast or an avenue north Van Buren street two hundred and thirty eight feet tall two hundred and one apartments as as I said at the side of the former and why does restaurant a mass timber beams twenty four inches thick\nUh the developer says this would be a record setter and how cool would it be that it's in Milwaukee after the break I'm going to tell you the story as we celebrate home Cummings high school homecoming college homecoming games there's a story from\nHartford, Michigan but a cheerleader plots in what she did that when it's maybe a little bit too far will tell you that certain that surgery Jim Jim\nSeverely than fifty one on WGM Jay fifty degrees at Radio City thank you for listening on this Friday\nCooler friday sin to be a wetter friday if you leave all those meteorologist or telling us where you get some heavy rain later today\nHopefully leading a little bit of a dry period for the brewers in the Rockies to get that game in the afternoon of course they'll get a damn just make the tail getting a lot more fun I'm I wanted to bring a store and she wanted to get his homecoming and a lot of different places in the high schools colleges [noise] this one comes from Hartford in Michigan\nSo high school cheerleader she went to the homecoming queen's so bad she's Seventeen years old and I can not to ... going to give you her name Hartford highschool Hartford, Michigan she wanted the crown so bad she came to school\nWith a pots literally a pots a pan of pot brownies and she had to nominate as a finalist for the homecoming queen\nShe was hoping this is what she told police that the brownies would sway her classmates to cast the votes to win the title she gave these goody bags to football players\nBut hers came with those brownies\nYeah showing an absolute no respect for her classmates Jordan for\nSorry at the same the find out what it means to me\nNo respect for her classmates getting them involved in something that frankly shouldn't have happened so she had been doing this to try to sway voters somebody gave anonymous tip to the state authorities who then shipped off to Hartford police\nSo they they retrieved most of these brownies in their entirety and parts parts of the third one or at least eight students\nFace possible spouse and for their roles are reaction in the scheme that it's not just funny as serious as well or Hartford police officer Michael print said I I've read about things like this across the country is not happening in this area that I Know of he said I've been an officer for a long time whenever you think you've heard it all something like this comes up\nIt's like wow unfortunately for the young woman her quest for a homecoming queen title was unsuccessful didn't attend classes last friday and there's now barred from purchasing all homecoming ceremonies\nUs as last friday and there's now barred\nFrom purchasing all homecoming ceremonies the end of the story even sadder she's not moved out of state since the incidents and said the police and the criminal charges will be pursued\nAs for those brownies that are remaining a police say the baked goods will be some of the crime lab for testing than analysis or no to homecoming queen wannabes or home coming king wannabes\nPots marijuana\nDon't put in your brownies probably not a good idea you will be caught it might make it popular for a day or two but you might eventually be caught in this case for young woman has the move out of state and may be charged probably will be charged for her role in the pot escapade Hartford, Michigan\nComing up in the eleven o'clock hour Christie for at Santa for bigger stories as we see it across Milwaukee to stay in the world will be joined by Cory Peterson um she's been on the show before she's a researcher for the more uh Wisconsin has two from our liberties smart woman or she's going to join me Tracy Johnson\nFrequent guest host I should say for when I'm off on vacation or or assignments or they're gonna both joined me but we have a lot to talk about today we're going to spend a considerable amount of time\nOn the cabinet are hearing in the end they vote\nOr I thought to be interesting to have the perspective of two women talking about what that story means not just for Brett Kavanaugh but to the me too movement all the things that relate to that do women when I'm guessing the answer's yes but the women thinking about this differently than men I'll give their responses on that do they think you'll be confirmed\nAs we move forward as I was giving you a some live testimony from uh the center for this a little bit earlier this morning fifty one forty nine and a procedural vote to move this forward now to the Senate tomorrow and it's down to these really these five senators\nAnd and no surprises you're on who these people are because they're frequently in the mix when it comes down to these key votes Susan Collins Republican from Maine she was a yesterday will she be tomorrow Jeff Flake yesterday same question what is tomorrow hold for him Lisa Murkowski from Alaska\nShe was a note today\nDoes that signal that she will be a no tomorrow Heidi Heitkamp is already a no North Dakota Democrat a lot of people think she just essentially ended her political career to very conservative state and Joe Manchin of\nWest Virginia Democrat who\nVoted yesterday in the procedural votes will he maintained that yes affirmative vote in tomorrow's full Senate vote on the on the final confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh ... I'm reading the storylines swirling around this procedural vote and there there is tremendous amounts of uncertainty\nBecause you can't always make a correlation between these procedural votes in the final votes especially when you're talking about a Supreme Court nominee and I'm a great point that's been made by a lot of people commenting on this is this is rare air\nMany of these votes are traditionally historically landslides\nMany of the many of the recent Supreme Court nominees and you go back to the days of Ruth Bader Ginsburg three no votes\nNinety six yes this is a different time and I spend a lot of lot of the early part of the program talking about where we're out of the country what is what this all means I don't think we know yet but tomorrow's votes if it happens tomorrow will to kind of determine\nThat next phase which is between now and November's midterm elections gauging the response gauging what voters will take away\nWell they judge Republicans harshly based on affirmative vote for Brett Kavanaugh will they judged Democrats harshly for their treatment of Brett Kavanaugh and the forgotten figure and all this and I I predict this will happen Christine Blasey Ford\nHer name will be lost and there's\nNo one's gonna care about Christine Blasey Ford that's unfortunate a woman that came forward I Believe she believes what she said but unfortunately she's gonna be one of those relics of history a and again the vote will determine a lot of the storyline but for her her treatments lack of\nConfidentiality when it was requested those things are things that I think any senator Republican or Democrat should look at going forward the news is next cease to be with you on this Friday right here in the ...\nAnd I don't always see somebody with you on this Friday\nGame show an LDS coming up later this afternoon on WGM Jay Giedd Wagner is live from Miller Park beginning at noon today of course every Friday eleven o'clock hour is the friday foreign to different people from different walks of life today we're joined by Cory Peterson she's been on the show before writer researcher at the Wisconsin is different liberty good morning\nAnd night and Tracy Johnson CEO car W but also\nMy favorite filling halls [laughter] great to be here or there have only or so or to jump right into a gym and traced you better be for a car you haven't been part of the friday form before we're gonna talk about the events\nThat are happening across this country and this morning the Senate\nMove forward a procedural vote to go to the full Senate tomorrow for a vote on the nomination of one that Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court I Want to\nGet your thoughts about this nomination at this time and kind of what it means to you want as a woman to as as a citizen the United states what does this nomination you well\nI think Lindsey Graham said it while and the hearings um he call it the most ethical sham I think he's exactly right um I just don't think there's evidence there is just say that I'm Kevin ... is forwards abuser and not saying that forward that's never happened before but I don't think the evidence is there to say that it was half\nAn hour and Tracy Weber Democrats you to Dr Ford is kind of gets red herring for and then the prospect of a sexual assault\nAnd I think that they were exposed for their inconsistencies and they're in sincerity to the real issue I mean even if a Dianne Feinstein this morning\nWhen she was a a bladder and about ... why she wasn't going to vote for him which was hunting on his record\nAnd if this was supposed to be about sexual assault and and this is what really cared about why is this is following all the different places and I think Trump is playing that's exactly right and the Republicans are playing this exactly right\nWhen they grab onto that and encourage Republicans to get out and vote for conservative so that we can ensure there are fewer Democrats like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in those positions of power\nIf Kavanaugh gets confirmed that still up in the air Lisa Murkowski peeled off to the issues now no vote at least in the procedural side of this world", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Conry", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "07"}
