living\nWages and ... you're talking about an Israeli stop you from leaving yes okay a are usually you're Israeli right\nYeah I mean and then I met a guy I I Can't afford to eat\nOut All right so you're a dual citizen yet and they talk to you from leaving Israel are and why do they stop you from leaving Israel\nThey couldn't tell me take you don't know that I Am and find out what what is it now that All right but I just I I don't I maybe I can do this from ... from California\nSo I have to pay and they asked me to pay cash and name\nWho do you have to pay cash to\nThe government\nAnd why do they say you owe them a on this amount of money\nThey found me they take you have to find out why walking it meant like\nDo you know how much you you know how much you owe them they told me ten thousand dollars okay and you're paid them three thousand dollars yes okay and then you got on the airplane and you came back to the United states yet All right and your question is\nDo I K against to the state of Israel yeah shot do have a case okay first of all um have you ever seen my a bar why since my license to practice law no you haven't yeah I Do know where a unlicensed\n... okay state of California\nAre you won't notice the state of Israel on there I ... yeah so what I Would do is go to the Israeli consulate and ... and you know what you can get a warrior up through the conscious that specializes in Israeli American law there are some\nUh who are in they'll give you the name of them but\nI don't know why use real was asking for three grand\nWhy Israel is asking for three grand\nMaybe maybe some executive ah\nMaybe somebody in the government won an extra three thousand dollars 'cause it was a short three grand for the bar mitzvah I have no idea the point is\nI don't know Israel right now\nOr if you were to ask me about your Sierra Leone eat that's\nA different issue because I happened to be an international lawyer who has expertise in Sierra Leone the law I don't know if you knew that\nA while oh that was terrific Hi Erica welcome to handle on the law right on yes ma'am on them yes\nI'm a hundred plus I Know [laughter] we'll look I can do my or defamation OK okay on come on come on line where it was\nAbout oh the live her ... her over that he knew or ... or our nominee late then watch out for her and that our how all her\nWell snake is a sort of up in the air I have people call each other snakes all the time the CDs part that crosses the line I [laughter]\nYeah that crosses the line matter of fact legally it crosses the line it's\nBecause it's a libel per se\nIn other words a libel per se means you're you don't have to prove anything it's by law liable and it goes back to common law goes back to a oh it's fantastic law goes back hundreds and hundreds of years English common law and the rules were liable per se\nIs a accusing a business person of dishonest business practices um Nepal\nThat's one of them are attacking a woman's virginity a ... and other one that one isn't used very much anymore Erica cars aren't too many ... just running around out there or the other one in my my favorite one is\nUh choosing someone of having a lot of some disease\nNow in those days are low some disease was basically it was leprosy black child cry it side believe me that's considered a lump sum those in the Los some disease yeah it's a case for defamation straight out uh I Would I Would contact lawyer is there any money on the other side does he have some bucks\nWon't be and I get ... you know yeah okay yeah I mean you definitely don't yeah you want you want to definitely talk to a lawyer there's no question about it now\nHere is a I think the question and maybe one of the most important questions because you know what you know what the defense is to a defamation suit no okay the defense is the truth so Erica here we go and do you have\nAn STD no off oh wait a second you said that pretty forcefully matter of fact you say that a little bit to forcefully if you really want to know into quickly if you know what I'm Talking about ... percent protest too much\nOr get a lot yeah yeah that's another a concept in the law ... dos protest too much just wanted to say OK\nDefamation liable per se love that and that was in like you know one doesn't anymore but I Love the low some disease one and then ... attacking women's virginity I mean how ... ... is that huh\nOK Dennis hello Dennis [laughter]\n\nYes you're up welcome to handle on law hello I'm Sorry\nDave I Apologize so that you and that's my fault hello there and they're good morning that already has her\nI have a a personal bankruptcy which will be discharged completely next September in the meantime I'm In the middle of a cash out refinance my or so residents\nIt's almost at the end and so we're on a timeline title search revealed that there is a second mortgage owned by a large bank or the title company will not fund the refine left that second is paid off outside of the re fi\nContacted the bank they said there was twenty five thousand but they would do for him I don't know anything about this loan I never paid on it I asked him to send me the records of the contract they said the records don't go back that far\nHow do they know you all the money\nThat was my question to them but it showed up on the credit report\nRight well that could be an area that could be an error\nI I understand that but they won't they won't provide any croquet alone in the meantime the the ... is being up yeah\nAll right so I I think at this point I Would I Would do is get a lawyer let her over to them\nAnd if it turns out that they don't have any proof that you all the money you just have you on was the money I Am because there was a letter or someplace there's some indication we have no backup what you're doing is a illegally interfering with my ability to get re fi\nAh and ah there's some there's some liability they're\nInterested in it in the meantime the locked in rates are going to\nOwn your there's no question now rates are are are exploding oh there is no issue about it at all so you want to work with your legs hurt although the lender is going to do everything now that interest rates are so high would love to get you out of a lock in rates or maybe they still want your\nBusiness who the hell knows at this point and that because I don't know the anticipated the rates going up as quickly as they have been going on in the last few weeks and\nSo you work with them but this is where I I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you're holding up uh my rate which is locked in interest rates are now higher there some damages there and you just you can't do that without proof what\nWe don't have the records well then how do I know the money well because you do I do [noise]\nSo that's why a letter from a lawyer and making a couple of demands would help\nWould there be any advantage to waiting until the next September when the bankruptcy discharges to get a just a standard or a conventional\nThey said the ... when we were having a window because of the zero why why so ... what city board meeting got very very nasty personal with the way I got you back [laughter]\nUm so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding new now or is it just screaming at you\nKnow the finding me a hundred dollars a month or ... or because they certainly are and they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming they're demanding I take the window out or else they would keep falling\nAlright has anybody else in the building a foot windows in in those locations\nNot tell you\nAll right so this is new well I it's\n... they have the right to say no or are they have the right to say if you put one in a dad in violation of the seats in ours\nOr they can say ... and you take it out until you are and and then here's your flying in a way to keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in and they they made it impossible for you to even\nI even make an application and there it is and there there by the way there's the court case\nOkay uh you have to ... ... what would you have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board every every board of directors a H every actually has an attorney who represents a that represents them and just have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible the management company when you call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying and trying and at some point I'll tell you legally what should happen even though it's the biggest pain in the ass you go to the point where they make an untenable and then you get\nA court order allowing you to do that because they made it on technical but that's way down the line so you've got an early on now it's a question of a what a pain in the asked the board is they're going to say hey we set up a time\nA set up a date you could've called us and found out it was eight o'clock or eight o'clock I Am or ... pm and you're going to say I tried yeah you never responded here's my phone call the management company and what you guys who were playing you're playing chicken with each other\nSo it's a problem\nInternally for the board we're sitting right next to me at a board meeting or one of the board that ms ... around ... occasion such quick to the window for putting solar panels and there's ... kicked the window out while a trip to those\nOkay that incidentally uh if anybody else will\nUh will state that who was in the room now he doesn't have a right to do that by the way that's not a legal decision okay that's that's a board decision but that adds to your argument that shows a decent argument really is it's a tough one God has problems today but I don't so that works out hello Dennis Hi Dennis\nWant to know what struck me to turn to break a least uh we were renting properties are flooded for crime there's carpet in the bed\nIt are flooded for time her carpet in the bedroom that we are we're over there to do and go on to dry them out uh we've been colder water and the wall also the water coming from the lab\n... years oh okay you just want out right I've you know they know that have they tried to fix it\nWhat they're doing the work around here are very well we're ... hit the\nRight girl weren't your way and you want and you want out correct\nYeah All right well based on the fact that his untenable to live there basically uninhabitable you say hey I'm Out of here and I don't even know if you need noticed you just say it I just can't live here anymore because of what's going on thank you I'm done and then what I Would do is give this much noticed as possible\nOr a and they're going to withhold a security deposit probably depending on the management company or they're going to demand some kind of a rent till the end of the\nLeast uh I'm assuming you're do you have a leash\nThrough Meg\nOkay uh so All right so you've got a good long time so you let them know\nWhat you're going to do and uh they unless they're willing to repair inside right now and unless there are and they're saying but we have to do it from the outside in a venue can withhold rent whether you can leave or not um I don't know uh but are you a negotiations with them at all\nThere are more crowded into a it is a single owner and what she's gone to the knowledge that the the from the drier and carpet of horrible or how\nDo you live like that now you can't live like that no you can't live like that so while that's happening you have to put you up in a hotel\nOkay and if you don't if she's willing to do that while she's ameliorate in
