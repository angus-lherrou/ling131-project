whatever the case it's going to start working on November sick in the next week joining us from the walking does this journalist John Ryan they've been doing a series of stories on all aspects of the ... good morning\nThere are so many things to talk about what this thing I mean just the actual logistics the implementation the effects where it's going to go what it's going to do how they're going to handle things like you know people are going to keep writing a maybe people are going to fall asleep on or whatever the case may be it also would have to do economically for don't tell me what the first let's talk about the basics it's gonna start\nMid day on November sick and what can be expected if you're driving or walking in downtown Milwaukee\nWell on the street cars have been running along kind of their regular out they just haven't been picking up passengers yet\nSo uh you know the city has already been out there doing a public awareness campaigns you know look out for the streetcar don't open your heart or into the street curb your part things like that but uh come about noon on friday a week from today it's going to start picking up passengers fares will be free and it's going to be running from a five and the midnight during the weekdays\nSo how many cars in total will be running on the track\nA I Believe they have five total but are they going to keep one in reserve [noise]\nSo [noise] how how is this going to work then I mean in terms of passengers getting on how many stops are there and how what are the expectations of how successful this has to be for expansion\nAlways about the Eighteen different stations right now and uh you know passengers get on they are going to have sort of the the buttons you can push to trigger a stop just like you have on the the bus system so it may not automatically stop at every station if there's nobody waiting there just to keep it on schedule\nUm as far as what it means for expansions I mean the next expansion to the lake front or most of the track is already built for that so that's going to happen and that right now the city as an application tending to get money from the federal government to build an extension to the arena\nReliability business journals Shawn Ryan talking about the ... district that's gonna be ah going into full operation next week and I would imagine in terms of who's going to use the ... going to be people who live and work downtown people who go downtown for events and things of that nature but also maybe even\nFolks who want to go to vice or foreign for a buck skin can't find parking nearby maybe they want to take to get to the vice or after the part that right maybe a few blocks away\nYep definitely one of the things that was interesting in speaking to other cities as they found there was a lot more kind of um dinner hour happy hour even you know the evening hours or ridership than they had expected more writers over the weekend to\nSo while you know a lot of folks are thinking folks who work downtown are going to be right in the ... a lot there could also be a lot more people than expected writing it or just for entertainment purposes when they're going out to have a good time\nI Would be entertained I think just riding on it for a while I mean how do you know along the whole circuit Texan\nI Am not sure about that\nRelied with ... Business Journal Shawn Ryan on WGM Jay and in terms of where it goes and where it doesn't go that can be the big issue moving forward you've already talked about the leak of expansion that's\nIn place and ready to go towards the lake front but I Would imagine businesses along this rather are pretty stoked for this because in other cities a streetcar line is meant development\nYeah that's what we found in other cities and I know\nThe mayor and Markey's development commission or have been out there pushing the or the increase and assessed value of properties along the route\nSpeaking of folks in the real estate industry they see it maybe not as the main driver of why they're investing you know millions of dollars into properties but they say it helps it's not something that ah they're against something that they're supportive of them\nAre there's that same kind of a kind of cautious optimism among businesses on the route to\nThat's a good point you bring up I Know you guys have gone to other communities to see how their street ... we have our detractors here in Milwaukee you say well this has been doing for the start executive work people don't want this what did you find it in other cities\nAre well one of the things to expect is that um there are going to be some issues as they you know get passenger service going and some of that is just because of the street car interacts with so much of Kennedy urban fabric I mean there are going to be other drivers that are going to collide with it if they're not paying attention it's kind of inevitable\nIt's going to come up where folks are not going to park writer there'll be a delivery truck to block sit in that ... impact the scheduling uh even when it comes to winter weather there are some changes that I have to be done in places like Detroit to accommodate that\nRocky business drill Shawn Ryan there with a whole series of articles about the ... the new Milwaukee downtown speaker of that's going to debut next week check it out at the Milwaukee Business Journal Sean thank you so much thank you seven twenty six at WGM Jay Dutton now for news about your money here spread out when the WTO ... associates mark it up to us\nTax rose yesterday as Wall Street recovered from the previous sessions earlier this week\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose four hundred and one point one three points mapping a three day losing streak is Microsoft outperformed the U.S and be five hundred again one point eight six percent is consumer discretionary intact both rose more than three percent and an ad\nThat composite climb two point nine five percent of Amazon rallied seven point one percent strong quarterly earnings report some Tesla Microsoft American Airlines and others helped ease some of these concerns reminding investors that the U.S economy as strong as incentive\nFor recent tax cuts continues to boost corporate profits Amazon shares sell as much as nine percent in after hours trading after the company released a mixed third quarter earnings report detect I reported earning five dollars and Seventy five cents per share much higher than the three dollars and\nFourteen cents per share analysts had expected alphabet sock fell nearly five percent and extended session after the company released the quarterly earnings report that miss revenue expectations for drinking associates signed Brant Allen financial advisor for news right\nWell see it signed Brant Allen financial advisor for news radio WGM Jae\nLee things are serving in law's death taxes have a Green Bay\n[noise] all\nOf her do the GM Jay\nJay Leno to hear from town windows and doors that's who I'm Talking with an e for your every window and door need hometown windows and doors is celebrating ten years\nThat's ten years of personalized service from start to end of your project ten years of quality employee installation with the largest selection in the area between pillow Marvin and more\nThe whole tone certified employee carpenters and project consultants are considerate of your time your budget your preferences bill impress you with their professionalism in their expertise you can see all of your options in life size displays inside they're beautiful ... in Berlin\nHelp us raise the bean and he was going to cause any harm to experience a lot\nOn during nine eleven victims is the goal the permanent they will also be an educational center and a place to honor the U.S military hope\nThat people come there\nLearn about bringing the drainage wage\nMemorial will forever give meaning to the words never forget and more information\nHad to WGM Jay ...
