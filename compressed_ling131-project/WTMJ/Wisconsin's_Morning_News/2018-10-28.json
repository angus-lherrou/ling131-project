story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America where the special segment of the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even on Jeopardy\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was written spiritual yes ... spiritual the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nAnd our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent has been institution of New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products Dr freshmen\nWelcome aboard mark ... speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was very troll phenomenon those people out there who just their vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is spiritual and why is it all over the news today well first of\nAll it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty help Journal's weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feed all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries as he founded\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plant\nPlants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and respiratory remark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberries robots first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interested in the early studies showed that resveratrol seem to extend the life of fruit flies of worms even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists you are absolutely wow\nBy two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the delight of certain\nI just discovered that resveratrol extend the delight of certain fish\nBy fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six and here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals\nBut the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent well whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nRestriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt than coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this which Don by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the key\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard now this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a little bit more you Julie products for several years under huge formulas but now there's the ins and would you say is just as important as residents role especially for your heart and uses in some ways it got even more evidence even so let me ask you this who needs it wouldn't generally is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak of water co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat and they were literally looking at hearts and saying what is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nThat co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nI tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity genes\nThey get switched on day help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increased tissue repair and its switched on by a group of genes called sirtuin now they found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases\nThese longevity genes these are two inch\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially use any traditional compound like Reza ... actively target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement in our house and are aging and our longevity\nWell now that the person you said it took you ten ... elite status in the nutritional supplements industry has been so well documented and so well researched all this evidence based nutrition and they didn't give us a brief overview of the research and explain why it took you ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back in Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin\nThe Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana Stockholm University in Sweden that great\nStudy recently at the University of and Connie and mentally on mitochondrial energy and co Q. ten University of ... in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti ... article published constantly throughout the world\nThe archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line in these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow document some charity products occasionally doesn't sleep bottled giveaways but this one sounds really special wasted is

knew there was a meeting with Dr denounce them the vitamin D council and it's made me a believer but un vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve\nYeah now many people go through life not knowing because they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time as more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people\nAnd we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this when most people think of vitamin D day of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role\nAs a supporter of the immune system it supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the university\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school at the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy calm on top of all of that and a great study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin

root cause that's right of pain in the body\nUm before we get into that Dr Janet and I'm a I'm going to ask you and I know this is hard for you because this is this is emotional but I think it's important for people to understand how you got to where you are today or why what what's driving when if you could share their story I'm\nSure well it it it was part that a lot of personal pain mhm and pain that my husband had years ago he had a severe osteoarthritis throughout his body at the same time I have fibromyalgia right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural\nTo help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\nMhm well let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that Amy oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right to your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain I took any oil\nAnd glucose me mhm I use Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay we're on the line that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory Sam and natural organic sulfur that is also just as important as glucose mean\nAnd rebuilding repairing our joints and so I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has no odor it's Greece list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain it doesn't irritate your skin goes in Fifteen minutes later you half originally\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and show and I had right because it right\nThen I have this year by the way of folks would cost me cream comes in a plastic dispenser that has pumped top on it it's\nA town of ... he'll need one to two pounds depending on the area okay of pain of the nation that sanitary contamination so you have to worry about it becoming rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body than the um you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also maybe ... read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply that claim to that area that you're going to target ... okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body heal itself provided you get the raw materials that needs and giving you what you made for your body and take over and do the job that was meant to do in that field okay\nAnd this is safe enough and you have to worry about I have\nTo worry about a thing if you're taking a drug for pain it well conflict with that at all none of these ... going to do that\nOkay so what what is then a a realistic expectation of somebody call today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell them\nI Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you're going to notice that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminate it okay and then over time you're going to rebuild and repair your joints with that inflammation being taken down\nThat's going to restore flexibility and mobility and sleep I mean if you can sleep again that's for our bodies get all of our recoup protest regenerative ability to heal and then with that being taken care of all the things that you love to do you can start doing again\nTraveling exercising so you can lose weight right socialize with family and friends you can be the life of the party\nYeah pain really changes who you are because of all these are the things you your can't do are very difficult to deal with in terms of of living a normal life are trying to\nLive well you can't you're right you're right living normal life in your life has changed forever and get this thing taking care of and you can\nYeah and you've got people

love for you to know how happy I Am with your product my feet and legs are usually and pain from being overweight and on my feet all day\nAt night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas unable to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nThank you so much for making this possible here's one more credit from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a miracle an attitude that truly does take away the pain and worked says nothing else I've ever tried to work quickly and lemonade all of the pain is out to me when our lease or these\nYou do these kinds of responses unusual\nNow really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails are these letters they just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have is my great results that's\nGreat I also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call

six seven nine seven zero nine or give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine [noise] so\nWhere do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that\nPerhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there that are trying but looking at it from a natural standpoint and Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again that when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have\nThe problem and again we've been talking about Dr ... cream and this is\nThis is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and this is good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme is minimal it is it's going to get you with me\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer take your pain from ten to five and ... on the line with continue you mind telling you that's very doable yeah so this is really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this was a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Janet\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all of my things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't\nWork first of all for ... or ... for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them turned out in something if in fact I going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the light of a sudden here taking into early ... months people gave up\nPeople in pain relief thing right now right and that I developed this train again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try it you have nothing to lose\nAnd when you call today you will not be enrolled in one of those automatic delivery programs this is a one time order you can try it and see for yourself how well this works so again the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven nine seven zero nine I'll give it to you one more time it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\nBall that's all the time we have for today thanks again to our sponsor Dr Newton's natural ...

all the gods of the king of nights when we were kids we used to say my daddy is stronger than your daddy a little bit of an absurd argument\nMaybe we can say yeah way is stronger than your job to bail\nWhich is a foolish way to say it because those other God's don't even exist those guys are not only not as strong as your way or as powerful as a way they don't even exist\nThe idols ... we tend to look to for purposes security or pleasure or purpose\nCan't give us a wife\nCan't forgive our sin can't overcome deaths can't reconcile us to one another chance poor grace over our souls can't promise us eternal life\nGuard instantaneously accepted the sacrifice ... offered and in that moment showed himself to be guided by the way that then became a day when he lied just cold all people\nTo a fresh commitment of safe\nIf God be God then follow him but have bailed dear God then follow him\nIf God is God even today\nThan stand up for the lord speak up for the lord confess your faith renew your commitment of love and loyalty\nTo Jesus Christ as God\nDid you know that in the book of revelation the harshest critique of the seven churches in the first three chapters of revelation is reserved for the church I'm Glad to see a because God\nSaid you are neither hot or cold your lukewarm slice bits you\nCouldn't be that we've slid into indifference in matters of faith and other things have become\nMore important to us than God holding a higher authority over us than God and so would become lukewarm\n\nAlliance was normally\nAll right and so would become new war\nLarger was not really courageous to stand up to ... have been just about the threat of death he was courageous to stand alone before four hundred and fifty prophets of bill than four hundred ... of the ...\nUnder the supervision of just bell the queen\nToday is still a day for us to decide where our loyalty lies\nWho is your God what do you believe about God what do you believe about the\nPurpose of life I find it interesting also that it describes ... before she prayed for God to accept the sacrifice repaired the altar\nSomeone one that I wanted to ask the farmer how old is your towel good last he ... called and said I suppose that was one tough of grass out of time\nCould be that you would slowly wandered away from the loyalty of your heart to the lord God who's revealed his love to you in Jesus his son or see here\nToday is a day for you and I just say Jesus you are my God and I will serve you\nThere's one more mountaintop where God revealed his power and glory that's mount calvary\nAnd it wasn't awesome Rob explosive power but this time\nIt was paradoxical power when the perfect\nThan holy some of the guard\nNamed Jesus was placed on the cross outside the gates and Jerusalem and his bruised and bloody bar the was mailed to cross and he hung suspended between heaven and earth until he could breathe you know more and said it is finished\nFather forgive them they don't know what they do and God's power was never more powerfully poured out and his grace flooded\nAll she would hearts more fully than in the moment we're Jesus the son of God our savior and his wife on the cross but there's more\nOn the resurrection morning ball of creation shook as Jesus the lord of life who was dead was brought back to life never to die again and so God in Jesus' name\nShows is power glory by offering us eternal life\nJesus\nIs the God who said ... and the revelation of his tower shows love that is beyond our understanding\nToday I asked you to place your face in him a man ... my\nLaw on AMC\n\n... have\nYoung man was on and on top of\nThe new\nYou know then he was Mad Men\nIn the room and now the\nGlow oh\nOh oh oh\nOh\nOh\nMaybe she saw it on a man in a way out of high and you\nKnow a\nA\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nA\nA a\nA\n\n\nPlease join me in prayer or you've shown your power in glory at\nAnd ... and in the resurrection of Jesus lord from the dead\nYou are worthy of our trust you are the lord of grace and mercy in life we are your servants for Jesus sake turn the hearts of all people to you oh lord\nI'm In\nHere this benediction the lord bless us keep us the lord make his face China north and be gracious to us the lord and look upon us with favor and give us his piece on man\nThe authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings and turns of plot\nAnd author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father he gets the mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way only smaller mom and dad smile baby smiles back\nThey ask questions soon she answers there's give and take a two way relationship\nIn contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level\nFor example Harry Potter Ronald ... her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling they're not even real in the same way that J.K rally in Israel\nThere author makes them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship\nHere saw the Bible says it who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor for was given a gift that God that God should repay him for from him and threw him into him are all things to him be the glory and to the age of the agents\nRomans eleven thirty four thirty six here's how job set it in God's hands is the life\nOf every living thing in the breath of all mankind if God tears down ... can rebuild if God's shut demand in non can open\nIf gosh you gather to himself his spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together in men would return to dust\nJob twelve and thirty four job's belief\nThat God is the author of all things is the foreign at the throbbing source of his anguish we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say God has torn me in his wrath\nGod gives me up to the ungodly cast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the which it live and prosper wire not tons of justice ... by the almighty\nJob sixteen Twenty one twenty four\nThis ... by the almighty job sixteen Twenty one twenty four imagined being trapped in a story like that at a turning point in the story of Harold Crick\nAgain he hears his author alluding to his past interpreting his present foreshadowing his future Tyne is tied here's the voice again it was remarkable\nHow the simple modest elements of heroin life so often taken for granted would become the catalyst for an entirely new life\nBy the end of day Harold had enough again he hears that voice in his head\nHarold suddenly found themselves beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens and utility no I'm not encouraging you used to be shut up and leave me alone\nAnd even if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story that doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you ... here that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trends stressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggled the more you only hurt yourself before you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him one day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nThe universe is a an accident of on guided evolution [laughter] the idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own happy ending I Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living and so it goes\nYou know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away\nIt gets worse\nNow you and I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is unavoidable cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provokes him\nAnd so on this particular Wednesday evening as heroin waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped dos Harold watched trust him into the mythical path of fade little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\nWatch what hey hello why my death excuse me in how\nHarold burst into his apartment ransacked the closet throws open doors turns out drawers searching for the voice okay\nWhere are you probably heard you\nCome on you're stupid voice something desperate now Harold become his own narrator Harold frantically\nGrabbed his lamp Harold incense should get out of room for no apparent reason smash it on the ground stopping it repeatedly\nCome on say something say something say something [noise] Harold\nDistraught God Harold distraught\nAnd the author speaks none about you this time but to you your author addresses you personally now I'm going to ask you to stop imagining and just believe part about God being your author it's true\nThere's another part of the story that I haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late hour author is not limited to one way author character relationships are authors not a solitary on moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father\nBefore even started this story from eternity\nThis author has a given take relationship with his son in in the power of his spirit he loves his son and as much as he loves his son this is how much he loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but his adopted son his adopted daughter\nHe justified your existence not because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you\nTo bring you into an authentic to weigh relationship\nA father son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history to take the named Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters and the strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive and to passively suffer as gospel loving children in his death he showed us how to express doubt with a job like faith my God my God why have you forsaken me\nHe said father into your hands I commit my spirit loop twenty three forty six and in his resurrection Jesus showed us how faith weights on the author of life\nGod is God with us or without us\nYet guy became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nFaith along was the phrase that the Protestant Reformers used to describe the to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul and they insisted that we are justified we are put right with God to face alone\nThis means that we are rescued from our rebellion by hearing in Jesus the voice of our author and taking them at his word trusting him receiving his story is our story that's what it means to be justified by grace alone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proceeding paid program was an outreach of Lutheran our ministries\nWouldn't it be cool if you can buy something and then if it turns out later you didn't need it you get your money back\nOkay not all of your money but some of it\nA little bit at least

I mean it's going to have to make up some bumps who's going to be an accident there's going to be some issues that come up and and you have to learn from it you also have to look at the schedule the schedule right now is going to change I mean I'm kind of what it is now they have to seek out when people are going to ride it\nKind of whether whether times are really well I had to kind of what they found out that he's that sometimes these things run kind of later in the evening that the\nPeople out about ... eleven twelve o'clock are actually on them so it's going to change it and kind of learn something like have the kind of the what we heard from other cities was kind of learn from how it operates and that kind of adjust accordingly\nYeah cause it's amazing we only have to go back a few directors and there was kids in Milwaukee dealt with quite well didn't\nIt did and I just think we have to get used to we have to sit there and I've had it coming to come in there all now for weeks that's been nobody out but it's been interesting to see how people react to\nEverybody's been treated by about ... what kind of running out to see it kind of what's it going to do I think a kind of want this up and running it's going to have an impact having it free is great because that helps in Milwaukee is you know everybody loves free here and I think people people are going to use it but I guess I'm I'm saying and others say if it had issues that it's going to have some here\nMark what's your sense right now for ... quickly we're going to expand beyond the downtown initial Lu\nI think the one that's going to head towards the lake front is probably the easiest and whatnot are hopefully happen over the next year or two they have to find out what's going on with the apartment building has been down at the end of it but that's already being built I think the most\nImportant one is the one that would extend it from the train station to the arena I mean with what's going on around the arena and all the activities and all that having that line is huge and then I think\nThat the natural setting it up into neighborhoods up until they are is held neighborhood down into the third ward and walkers quiet neighborhood because I think I'll be as you might have it just ends up as it is right now is it as just one line I don't think it's going to work it needs extensions\nIt needs to kinda have to be part of the city\nAnd it's important to move forward during the momentum as\nIt is I think there's a lot of momentum right now I think people you know people it's hard to imagine what it's like it's kind of hard to ... how to ride wants it up and running back for a few months it's going to be a lot going back to that first year it's free so I think the city has to really kind of see that kind of grab it and really run with it\nOK talks are underway to extend the Miller Park naming rights you know this is almost forgotten story especially during the pennant shows you know we're all thinking this is going to go on forever but no it's renewable downriver fills\nIt is it time and there's no doubt that it's been a great run for both of hers and four and foreign never course\nI mean people just you know just call it mellow park it's just automatically assume that it's just I mean it's really kind of need this kind of a great partnership I Would be very surprised if it was not read it but it's got to get going here and they are that actually runs through twenty twenty right now it's had a pretty low cost of\n... one million dollars a year for example or having a comparison big bucks new weapons with one of the Pfizer result\nIs over six million so there's a there's a lot of opportunities I think here for both I think there's gonna be a lot of talks you have to kind of play the game but there's no doubt I think in the long run it's going to be able to talk for a long time to come\nYou know what I always find interesting because the corporate world is so brand based on your brand and one's a merchandiser or products or whatever you look around the venues around the country and there's a lot of turnover on naming rights which to me I find surprising\nThere is I think it's for a couple of reasons one is the cost it's very expensive but it's\nAlso hard to measure that there were turned out it from talking to people they say that you know how much return to get for it but I think in this case it's a partnership you have Miller which is located with its operations right near the stadium you have their part shepherd the brewers we're known as it burns city Miller Park has been known that way forever\nYeah I think this one's going to have this kind of like you know you think of other stadiums across that country kind of where it makes that out in Denver with the officer corps in St Louis I mean I think that's a natural fit and I think it's a natural want here for sure\nOkay a earnings are been released a just now or ... as it affects a Harley Davidson I Know you're watching this story very closely what are the numbers telling us and what's the immediate challenge right now\nI think the challenge for them not surprised I have here in our country they've had some pretty good sales growth internationally and that's what they've talked about they really want to go get an athlete but here in our country it's not been as good now it's interesting the Shia everyone's trying to try to determine if all the fighting\nAt Twitter wars with the president's hell impact on that I don't know if you can you know climate for sure but there's no doubt it's had them in the headlines it's had some issues for them and of course as the\nTerrorists that are out there too which is a huge deal for Harley so there's no doubt it's a struggle and there and they said that the next few years I going to be a struggle for that but they feel very confident and that they're coming out with with a with a lot of products with the electric motor cycle\nWith more marketing really try to expand their base in to both millennials and African\nAmericans and other minorities really trying to grow that market but there's no doubt hardly have a lot of\nMinorities really trying to grow that market but there's no doubt hardly have a lot of hurdles ahead of it\nOkay Mark your books have launched the beer garden tell us about a ... is a ticket out here\nIt is it's just something to do that without the opener for the\nBucks a week ago it was the same night as a sex scandal of Vienna affairs for the brewers the buck stir about Seventeen thousand or more people there after that it is what the ... first game about two or three thousand individual kind of went out of the arena they stopped that this ... which had a twenty eight foot\nFreeing up on the wall now that so that's one thing I like in my house mark I don't know about you\nAnd they shouldn't watch the game and they bought beer and it wasn't it it was kind of struck me as where am I I'm not in Milwaukee anymore I must be in Chicago or New York or some other city but now here I was walking on a\nFriday night thousands of people outside and they were watching the game I just make sure that they were sharing and they were high fiving and they were drinking beer and they're having a great time and it was a cool environment and one of the box have talked about if you remember at the beginning they talked about\nReally impact on say try to create a neighborhood around the arena so you can eat you can drink you can hang out you can live you can park you can do all that right around there that's the first time I saw it in action was extreme because the birds around the play offs and the and the game but I think we're going to see that a lot more\nIt's amazing I mean there really is something to Russian rule and they will come\nAfter you had at twenty foot screen\nTV a\nPlace for you but I Do I'll be there mark I don't know about you\n... from there
