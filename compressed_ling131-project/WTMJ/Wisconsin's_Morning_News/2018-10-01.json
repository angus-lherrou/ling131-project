continues against the Chicago Cubs one more game to be played at Wrigley Field to the number one sixty three to see who goes on with the central title the loser will play tomorrow night taking the winner of the Dodgers Rockies playoff\nGame first time in in or MLD history that to play off games have had happened on the same day to finish off ... again one sixty three if you will be joining us live as the radio play by play voice of your Milwaukee Brewers one of them at least ... joining us live ...\nGood morning everybody\nSo as I was doing the master the and that's always a dangerous thing a cubs won the series eleven to eat that's where they get to hosted they but at one point in the season because one seven games at the very start of the season it would seem if nothing else maybe the brewers haven't figured I'm totally safe to say they're not intimidated playing the cubs were doing it at ...\nNo not by any stretch to root for either the or even thousands Seventeen and Rick repair work nine games are quite twenty two teams here at Berkeley so\nI mean they get familiar territory crepe now than it sounds like there's a lot of ... between these two teams um I\nThe brewers know who their faith in God I'm going to be seven times are going to say you're twenty eight people saying oh we've got to them once and it was here at Wrigley Field depends on which way the wind blowing out and I think that's going to be a really talented than others games get played\nBut nobody knows who's starting for the for the brewers yet so we don't know if it's going to be are you going to have a middle ganging up late guys I think it's going to be a huge strategy situation for both men today\n... what about the weather does that play a big factor\n[noise] I mean it's a it's a huge factor because this really feel quite like different ballparks the wind's blowing in the very picture from the ballpark wind blowing out\nIt's anybody's guess to see what kinds of score you're going to end up with so um the weather is a little bit of a fact it is not ready to get cloudy and I don't think it's supposed to rain until later today so that the new start a certainly ... old weather wise\nUm but I I don't think there's going to be any delays in in just a matter which way the wind or\nTalking to a couple of guys in the clubhouse after the game uh yesterday Jeff a couple of them Ryan Braun Christian yellow dj kind of indicated that they're treating today is a must win and it's not necessarily a must win it'd be great to have it but even if they lose today they still play tomorrow and I think Craig council tennis\nIs cognizant of trying to manage like tomorrow's the must win and not today\nWhere your season can't end today that's that the the bottom line there you can't lose your great it could go back home in quite a wild card game tomorrow and then you could see her but um if the brewers winter day then they get two days off quite Thursday and they host whoever wins\nThe wild card game on Tuesday which would be in Milwaukee are in Chicago so it's not ... we're in a it's a really important ball game but I think both managers are managing their game um depending on if this thing gets blown out of the water by either ... whichever way it goes\nYou got to face cooking for tomorrow because then you're you're you for your season tomorrow I'm certainly ... manages very cognizant of if you're on the team out grew as get up big on\nOn Chicago like did it yesterday in Detroit you you're not going to the air naval and Jefferson those guys are because you can save them for a for Thursday and give them even more\nSo it's um it's a really interesting strategy for today's bargain cotton ball game it it gives you a June ... ... if you're the cop you're playing one game of forty days and you certainly want them to play tomorrow more than you want them to have a couple of days off\nChecking the wind at Wrigley later on today and the weather dot com forecast that could get my gloves on short notice easterly wins seven miles an hour or so it's it's not going to be a big deal coming off the lake by a darn said but just enough maybe the soccer ball down hitting out to right field\nYeah no doubt and that's and that's important too because the brewers are facing left hander today that you're going to have a lot alright heres wind up going to be pushing more towards leftist attach brewers end up starting a left hander kinda neutralizes the likes of Rizzo and and Murphy and for her and some of the left is that the cubs might be running out there today\nThis is fun stuff isn't it though this is the black and this is what you play for right you want in the three the first time in history it's happened for for two different leads to go
