really something special\nUm if you look at the best selling ginseng supplement on the market today it contains a hundred milligrams of ginseng extract\nOur tripled ginseng product contains seven\nHundred milligrams of pure ... you've boosting ginseng power and basically what that means is that you're able to get a many times more the concentration of active principles\nA much stronger

Singh a two hour ... one just sitting in here is politically tested deliver brain benefits in his little was just two hours to be while you fill me in on that\nThere's a reduction in stress hormones in the blood and an improvement and function so the ... thing extract that we have in the triple ginseng formula we can say with certainty that it's really a mind sharp in there and you know I I I'm always amazed that\nPeople will say go into a coffee place and spend you know four dollars on a lot to say and maybe they'll do that every day and yeah they get a little bit of benefit you know a little bit of caffeine\nBut you get so much more for so much less money on a daily basis by taking something like this tripled ginseng which works in two hours\nAnd I would encourage people to just think about the real value of having a sharper mind stronger body more energy and endurance for less than what you pay for a lot to\nSort of British use a triple ... also functions like a Daily Doubles and vitality booster kind of helps you get your ... age can you elaborate\nYou know as we age and this week go through life and as we do the things that we do um different dimensions of our youthful functions slip away you know we may not have the same kind of\nA strong energy and drive but just that natural inclination to be active and when you take ... saying I'm not saying that you're suddenly going to be like you were when you're sixteen in fact I'm not sure that I'd actually want that but\nYou get back some of that stronger energy some of that you know I can last all day doing whatever I Need to get done\nA and this really is an edge this is an advantage especially considering that you know we're constantly having to perform whether it's just running the errands for the day or the pressures of work so this this does boost health and vitality and the great news is you feel it\nI Know ... the top of your list the herbs and make a difference in fact you caught experience it and it's kind of rich heritage and present out search parties were using thousands of years ago you tracked ... also in southwest China but ... province ... what did you learn on that expedition\nWell ... is a really interesting place ... it's the most ethnically diverse part of China you have like twenty five different ethnic groups there and\nUh it's a big agricultural center very mountainous water rice lot of corn um but one of the bay area very big product there is ... saying and I went to all around you non uh for a period of time\nOr you know visiting different than saying operations and and what I see that it's one of the gym thing bread baskets if you will for China because as you mentioned before people in China on a regular basis take Jens thing they'll consume ... T belly\n... saying roots they'll take extract and different forms maybe even in liquor and that type of thing so when I went to you in on what I saw was ginseng plantations all over the region\nFirst before we remind our listeners about the three bottles triple ... Singh let's talk more about this are gee one factor the junior triple ... formula and it's not typically found in typical ... formulas because well it's quite expensive you kind of do their homework for us I hear your matched the research on our G one\nWhich is awesome and here's a great article stayed in the ... factor argue one makes humans fitter and stronger another article colds are do you want a muscle rejuvenating break that down force\nMakes humans fitter and stronger another article calls are do you want a muscle\nRejuvenate or break that down for us\nThis relates back to how we like to straddle\nAnd modern science\nIn the different traditional herbal tax China and other parts of Asia you have reference that Jim saying can help you to be stronger\nA you know it can help you to have you know better muscle activity these days people like the science to back up the traditional claims and we have that in human clinical studies\nWe've seen strength enhancement just by taking ... sang a greater level of fitness overall better and better and better recovery and also muscle function in our triple ginseng product\nAlright here's the offer you can't refuse and ... to our triple ginseng make that call these these moved fastest one\nEight hundred three eight three Eighteen\nSixty four simply call purity products right not be one of the first thousand polish they just pay six Ninety five for shipping and handling which is one hundred percent refundable by the way I'm sure he's gonna rush you out complementary bottle of triple ... mess right of free bottle\nDirty knows that once you experienced the to our benefits the triple ... saying that you're going to love it and it's so easy to cheat just too little capsules a day for your free bottle to our tripled since a call now\nOne eight hundred three eight three Eighteen sixty four that's one eight hundred three eight three Eighteen sixty four\nLots of insights today on perhaps the world's most legendary urban genes sing usually popular in Asia back like tons of research to\nEmperors sent out search parties for this prize to root thousands of years ago its benefits are in a word remarkable Christ as we get older you call ... Singh a physical and mental plant based booster of the highest order what do you mean\nWell I look I can tell you from my own experience not that I'm a definitive clinical study pat but you know I I'm older and I travel in in the valley and my schedule is a regular and I really have to go go go go go and I find that when I take this tripled ginseng product\nI'm able to kind of go live through the day you know I I mean I don't feel like a sixteen year old I won't pretend that\nBut I feel much stronger and much more capable much sharper if you're going to take a supplement you will find no ginseng product on the market any place in the world including in China including in all other parts of Asia that can rival our triple ginseng formula\nSo Christian you review the three types of ... in the triple ... formula and why this combination seems to work above and beyond just taking one form of ... which you find in most other formulas\nIn a we have ... saying and panics gym thing is Asians and sang and uh it's very popular for all the right reasons so we have a good\nConcentrated extractive ... two hundred and fifty milligrams of that in this formula we also have the Korean red ... thing\nAnd that is ... ... thing that has been deemed and treated with different herbs that's the one that has the real super high concentration engine Senate sides that we mentioned before\nAnd the third one is the Sarah boost extract and that is an extract of American ginseng which has different properties than the ...\nThe three of these together give you all of the possible benefits known for every type of ginseng\nWith two hundred and fifty milligrams of the Korean with two hundred and fifty milligrams of the Asian with two hundred milligrams of the therapist and as I mentioned before two hundred fifty milligrams of organic ... Sandra Barry extract\nTo really move this whole formula and enhance all of its vitality promoting properties\nAnd Chris for the men and women you say they're going to love this red ... to ... and the triple didn't sing capsules I understand is great for energy and vitality\nBut there's a lot more to the story but research shows this red June sing promotes libido and men as they age and also sexual arousal in women especially as they go through the change of life so this red juicing pretty hot stuff right\nIt is hot stuff that has a long long reputation in the literature for being a sex enhance or oh we've seen some good studies on men and women showing a boost in sexual function and this is one of those kind of surprised benefits you know sometimes people take\nGym thing for energy and then they go wow you know I'm I'm noticing a little bit of a turning back the clock here so yes we have good human clinical study showing that it does this for both men and for women and I think that's exciting to a lot of people\nSo Chris we're running out of time to recap we'd kind of cutting edge gene sing formula here in triple ... Singh\nYou've searched the globe for the good stuff I mean we've got three forms of ... and these capsules best of all the brain boosting benefits you'll experience in just two hours that's unbelievable then there's the energy the stamina vitality benefits on top of all that a free bottle to I mean come on\nChris pleased recapping water give the triple ... formula try\nVirtually every adult certainly can benefit from this tripled ginseng products for the enhanced energy for the reduction and stress for the boost in sexual vitality for the improved and during some stamina\nI'm this is something that really is experience show as you said before you try it\nYou feel it you're going to like what you feel a and if you're a person who wants to any of those benefits you can find no finer product out there no matter where you look than this tripled in the same formula\nSo there's an awesome free bottle offer today on surety products cutting edge to our triple ginseng formula call right now just dial one\nFor six seven nine seven zero nine\nOkay well if you're just joining us we've been talking with Dr Janet ... she's a natural health expert she's also an expert in dealing with pain pain relief\nBut we've been talking about how pain has a devastating effect on our overall health and now how her glucose mean cream this was a natural solution is a way to really get to the uh uh I guess the root cause let's try of pain in the body\nUm before we get into that Dr Janet I'm ...

I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that Amy oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right to your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain okay I took any oil\nAnd glucose me mhm I use ... which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay drama lane that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic sulfur that is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding repairing our joints\nAnd so I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has\nNo odor it's grace list it doesn't freeze the pain and doesn't burn the pain and doesn't irritate you scan goes in Fifteen minutes later you have really so that's why I'm here\nTo share what I Know and show that I had right because it

go down in the body heal itself the body heal itself provided you get the raw materials that needs and giving you watch\nThe raw materials that needs and giving you what you need for your body to take over and do the job that was meant to do and that skill okay\nAnd this is safe is nothing that you have to worry about\nI have to worry about a thing if you're taking drugs for pain it wrong conflict

Noreen routine\nThere were good times in hard times there's lots of conversation opportunities to observe one another as they serve Christ together they spent time composing letters to the various churches we see as we look at the other letters they stayed in touch one separated that usually leads to something\nVery profound and special\nI had a special friend like that\nThe former speaker for this radio ministry Homer Larson and I traveled a lot together\nHe was my best friend\nWe traveled to preaching conferences together and evangelists some conferences we spent a lot of time traveling together and I am so much richer\nTo have known him and shared life with him that way and even to this day I feel the loss of him not being around\nAnd have other individuals that I Would call three am friends is Rob and who I call on a on a weekly basis and talk to are we tax back and forth and there's days when we socialize together as well as served together and\nThere's a certain bond there\nYou want to do so friendship you need to commit to that time in the presence with someone\nOf another thing they had was a there is some transparency deep saw friendships involve self disclosure cultivating transparency they knew each other's personal histories well Paul knew about Timothy ... mom and grandma\nOff the banning trans parents if they knew each other's personal histories well Paul knew about Timothy ...\nMom and grandma unison low us and his background and what kind of a father we had\nAnd Tim new Paul's sorted path nothing was hidden from one another and as you read the whole letter to Timothy Paul openly shares his heart and his soul his affections he doesn't hide anything he says I'm dying my mother raised the end of my race has come and I need you here with me\nAnd obviously as he's encouraging Timothy throughout this personal letter about his own ministry it's apparent that Tim is shared some of its own fears and weaknesses as a fellow minister and Paul knows his strengths and weaknesses and he addresses those in this letter\nDeep so friendships require willingness to show yourself\nTo be perhaps what you would say vulnerable with each other\nAnd they're so friendship\nExpressions of affection\nThere's a lot of affection being expressed in this letter there's tenderness in love and care being expressed by Paul I'm praying for you Timothy I'm grateful that God whenever I remember you and my prayers and I'm constantly praying for you Knight and day and oh how I long\nTo see you because when I see you that fills me with joy Paul says he remembers Timothy steers it their party and perhaps he's referring to X. twenty what we're ... ... what the fusion elders and Paul ... didn't they embraced\nAt one another as they said their goodbyes was Timothy in that group knows he begins his letter my love a child\nMore than once Paul refers to Timothy with terms of endearment such as my son my beloved no doubt in Timothy as mine this guy loves me cares about\nMe\nThere was a lot of encouragement an affirmation as well\nSo deep friendships have encouragement\nA lot of this kind of sentiment Tim I Believe in you\nKnow let me remind you you're called by God you have a gift for preaching God is great plans for you\nI leave my hands on you at your nation I poured myself into you know\nInteresting to you the pressure's good news of Jesus and now I'm asking that you guard that\nGood news is that I've given\nAnd stick with it\nAnd you can I Believe because you have the Holy Spirit living in you Tim\nHow's that for encouragement and affirmation\nTheir deep so friendship\nThese kind of friendships grow\nDeep so friendships with trustworthiness Paul described Timothy as one that that he trusted fully\nAnd other letters he said there's no one like him that has a genuine caring for for your congregation liked him\nWe see that and Philippe eons Timothy didn't run when the chips were down on those travels with Paul he stayed with him\nThey have learned that they could rely on each other\nI'm In trusting the gospel ministry do you Timothy all that I've begun Paul ... said to him\nAnd deep so friendships fine my name\nOr grounded firmly in the gospel and the promises of Jesus Christ Jesus was their strength there consolation their common ground there counseled at one another as they went through the ups and downs of life there is this common eternal friendship with Jesus at the center\nI came across this statement that says Jesus is the only ... totally reliable friend for centers he is the only flawless friend and therefore the only friend who can make other friendships eternal\nAs much as you might love your earthly friends and family they cannot rescue from every evil deeds and brings safely end of the heavenly kingdom there's only one friend that can do that Jesus Christ\nHe loves you look what he did for you at the cross be strong in the gray citizen Christ Jesus they would say to one another\nPerson truly is rich and not a failure with a friend or to like that and their life's too personal questions for you today do you have someone like that that you can turn to that you can lean on\nA three am friend a soul friendship and secondly\nWouldn't you like to be a friend like that\nYou see that's what God wants for you keep your eyes open to find friendship possibilities God has provided them\nJesus never intended that the enjoyment of his presence would replace the enjoyment of the presence of other Christians she has been dying across to create isolated worshipping individuals he died to create Christ exalted friendships\n[noise] you know where you can find those kind of friendships where do I find a poem or do I find it Timothy ... Paul or or a camera to do life together with in the church the church is a good place to start get plugged in to the church\nIn worshipping in service with ... with other Christians\nIn our congregation we have a small group Bible study ministry that's been helping people make friends like that for the last Thirty years\nAnd I'm Amazed at what is done in relationships are ... ... in my own life\nBut as well as I've participated in these not too long ago I I went up to a witness or an adoption taking place five hours away my wife and I drove to go up there and then we got there there were all these people were waiting didn't know we were coming but they were there I said what are you doing here\nIs your church people he said we're in a group with this couple we loved them we've been praying for them to last year and a half as they've gone through this procedure we wanted to see this now\nRecently I was doing a funeral and some people showed up that I didn't expect I said what's your connection oh we\nWere in a small group with this family\nIt's been a real blessing\nThe encouraging shared joy they rejoice but those are rejoicing we put those who weep and that's what God belongs for you to have\nAnd that's what everyone needs something like that a deep soul friendship\nJust that in your life\nI'm Matt let's pray father us provided everything we need for face in the ups and downs of life with you your presence in power the family of faith to encourage and support us along the way\nMay we not only sync soul friends within the community of faith but may we also see to me a soul friend to others in the name of our greatest friend Jesus we asked the same man\nNow is you go on your way make Christ go with you may go before you to show either way behind you to encourage you beside you to the friend you above you to watch over and within you to give us peace oh man\nYou've been worshipping with the Internet and radio ministry of the Christian crusaders gay parade today's message has encouraged you to keep your eyes open to finding friendship possibilities which God has provided\nChristian crusaders is eighty two years old our first broadcast went over the airwaves in Nineteen thirty six you're invited to help us celebrate with an anniversary gift to the ministry of eighty two dollars or more are donation\nI Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified\nWill solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence making the cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kinds that God wants to have with you\nIt will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful considering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around at godsend his son and he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which caused St Paul to say to all of us price did not send me to see how many I could baptize but to proclaim that gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive notice of clever words\nAnd to see how many I could baptize\nBut to proclaim that gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive ness of clever words for I have no desire to Rob across our the preaching of the cross is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world\nTo wash who are being safe from that that it is nothing less than the power of God\nIt is written I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... the president will I reject fucking or what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom has not gone made the wisdom of this world foolish\nFor was after the world and its wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all would believe\nBy the simple mindedness of the gospel message for the Jews asked for me right give us troops and the Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the ... tiles\nBy for those who are called why they chose are gentile as price the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise]\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology I'm joined here in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us minister Easter Lutheran our ministries\nThe rapid pace of technology has not slowed it all has it\nI I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield or we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] I don't know I got up and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started they started to you know kind of multiply in their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let them next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI have this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need\nThem [laughter] and now you know\nHow it's going to permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin it it also brings questions of of morality and and usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better ... that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm a someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die\nReally yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that\nWell I I think that the the point is that when you have a faith of any kind um that talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point no this is the right point or my way of saying here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith and thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we've reached that message each week you're on the program and that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity\nIs the goal post really never move [laughter] it's a a Jesus has already kick the ball and and the game has been one [laughter] um and for us the message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God is here\nFor you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever and his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and while things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic is something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a\nDifference and in that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people have got\nOh and this is the kind of the beauty of it in almost a ... knowing beauty but it's it's a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from saying\nWe are connected to that death\nSo in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platform\nThe real question that we should be asking is as hot as God's Ears and God sees us in Jesus our identity as him\nIn him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at us he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us any cares for us any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the uh the foolishness of the message\nThat the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really the why is this person in the world would not have come up with this is a solution to the to the problem is and you know so you think that okay\nSin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that Jesus in in that son of God and his sacrifice is somehow a Tony for us\nThat doesn't make sense it it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically\nOr treat it like math or science or you know something like that in dissect it in the end you kind of step back from an eagle wow how that is not how I Would have thought about that that's that's not how I Would have done that but in many ways that that again is where the beauty of it is God's solution\nFor a problem that transcends our ability to cope with it\nAlso has to transcend our ability to cope with it so if God had to provide a solution that was so beyond us but in many ways I just kind of really stand in awe of what the gospel is and the doubts that he went through and what that meant\n\nThe proceeding paid program was an outreach of Lutheran\n\nThe proceeding paid program was

really one that's taken the headlines right now and I think this is the eleventh iteration of Halloween but it's really supposed to be the sequel to the original do I have that right\nI think I don't have to say anything else because you've summed up perfectly you know if it's a big box stores\nAre but the Halloween to you know still a on a ... on the big screen a yeah it's a ... in the Nineteen Seventy eight classic which is you know written directed by John Carpenter it's regarded as sort of the patient zero of the slasher genre of the original film\nIt's set in stone that morally simplistic a woman as victim\nI Am a format where you know bad girls diet and good girls live the original stunt you marry Curtis as a babysitter reflect back as the killer Michael Meyers kills her friends and uh and uh and and the new film critics returns to the franchise says that gray haired shot gun toning grandma\nHunting the killer from the first film of course you know her mother is certainly who is murdered and the shower scene that cycle and becomes director of the report a David Gordon Green is an art house director with the B movie mentality\nIn ... he wrote the remake with Danny McBride the actor specializing in a noxious characters and many of his films\nWhat is it about that genre or what was it about the original Halloween that gave birth to that slasher genre\nYou know that's a really good question I ... it grew out of the eighties you know that was the Gordon Gekko a era you know I think you'd want to create I think there was sort of in a more now you know immorality running through the country in the film sort of a parallel that the slasher genre\nAnd I don't know it's it seems peculiar to the American for some reason because a lot of cultures have art films but the flashing sheets or non of some kind of American uh\nUh I don't know I mean for violence and and you know of course he's from Korea and young women which makes them a kind of a you know a politically kind of a volatile film so yeah there's a lot going on in those things that I just somebody attacking some on\nThe other big news you're more locally when you talk ... is a the marquee

B. J. good morning mark\nHow are you they've gotten not bad [noise] baseball\nI'm curious to get your thoughts I Know you've been to a bunch of these games and a bunch of these playoff games what impact that you've seen\nLocally can we quantify the impact of this playoff run just based on your expertise and analysis\nHere on the I don't think you'd put an exact dollar amount about it but there's no I mean there's no question it's been great for the city\nIt's been great for the sponsors think of I think a a new records\nAnd all the and all the attention is getting could think of George Web and all the attention is getting big of all the businesses where are you seeing all this was after the brewers I mean this is great for them this year but uh but you know it's always great for that team the really the next year thing all the sponsors were going to walk her name with them next year they call the season tickets are going to be sold next year\nI mean they're going to have I mean they had a great year this year off the field they are going to have an incredible year next year because of the success and I think because people think\nThat it's not a one kind of your head I mean if they're set up for three or four years of this it's going to be great financially for them\nI'm curious to get your thoughts as well Spicer forum I don't know if it's lost in all of this brewers um hype and and chatter and excitement but\nVice or forum friday night the official regular season opener for the bucks but my gosh the lead up to that with the concerts after concerts under shows I Know you were at the eagles last week um if that impact as well has been remarkable\nIt really has I think that's showing people the real impact of the reason I mean the bucks came there was great you had a full house and it's really cool but think about it for four nights other than the box opener\nFrom you you mean you had the foo fighters and the eagles and Metallica and the Twenty one pounds may think of all the fans that were there I Know for the eagles show I mean the alliance for the merchandise were were\nWere hardly lawn I mean at the concession stands are selling lots of stuff I mean they're making a lot of money this week it was great for the building is also great to try it out because you see all kinds of things like ... and I mean I'll tell you I was in ... it was the first show August ... and the sound there is great so much better than the pilots on it because it's so open\nAnd the food was good at it which is a great experience but it's great for the city I mean on a Thursday night I mean down town I Am a world there she wasn't hacked you can get near there and that's good for the city and I think it's happening a lot more and you're bringing huge acts acts that have not come here as often as a as obviously with rallies are\nOne of the other big stories that are you guys covered this past week looking at the governor's race\nAnd the angle of where business executives are kind of throwing their support and I guess maybe just as importantly more importantly their money so they can be kind of relate what you guys down when it comes to the Walker Uber's raised some where some of these execs are going with their wallets\nProbably not surprised a lot of them are going for Scott Walker I mean he's a lot of support in the business community ... years and that support has met money he's raised a ton of money in there now I've seen some inroads for ... you know he's got some pretty high profile names behind them kinda like Alex ... in the box and some of the other people like that\nHave been behind him so he's getting more but it's still Scott Walker I'm I'm In the business community is very pleased with what he has done from an economical standpoint\nFrom a air regulations that boy so he has the support now is it enough I mean is that enough to offset what's going on in this country with the blue wave will shape but there is no doubt if it was an election from the business exact it would be a Scott Walker when\n... kind of thing on the political tone for just to be longer it's been interesting to watch the on again off again relationship maybe that's too strong a phrase when it comes to President Trump and Harley Davidson and we we seem to be in this little bit of a low period where we haven't heard much on that front\nWas kind of quiet right now which I think Harley loves hardly I mean quietly will say how awful it was fun to be put in that position to have the day the\nObviously the head of the country aiming at you almost every day every couple of hours so for damage really been quiet which is good what I found interesting is just from speaking to people about it you know hardly handle that one pretty while they were quiet they didn't engage with the president and then go back and forth with them\nAs others have and their brand is strongly we've talked to a lot of the writers of the ... area and there were income what they've heard is that the brand kind of worn out people love the Harley brand they love the Harley name and that's the kind of want highly has been as successful as has been\nAnd really if he doesn't come back to it I think this issue is over for them obviously I think of it when if anything happened in it for them I was moving the jobs at a country that's going to come back but for now probably isn't a good spot\nTalking with mark cast as we are\nNow how is that a good spot\nTalking with mark Hasse says we always do every weekend you're in Wisconsin's weekend morning news the last point I I Want to bring up is something that has been\nOf interest to me now for a long time and that is the the state of Mitchell international airport and we heard some news again as you guys covered this week another announcement of a major potential major renovation so what are those plans what's the latest there on this or whether they finally\nMoved to head on the plans for international terminal and that's the area\nAs you're walking on the on the south that old terminals really not use right now so they're going to turn that into the national national trauma and that was actually\nOn in a whole other building if any ... in the current terminal so that would really help I think there's a lot of work that's been kind of plan the airport is kind of looked at your national Trump will be first after that would be a ... a ... wants to carry insurance\nI mean think about all other airports are almost I had a pretty good you enter once and then you can walk round you hit the retailers you hit the restaurant you go to all the gates\nIn Milwaukee there's three there are three points of insurance\nI mean you've got to go through three different security access so I mean if you arrive on an American flight and you're living on the southwest like you have to leave their security and you have to go back to your skirt again and you wanna try a restaurant in one of the other terminals you've got to go through security again very inefficient very hard for people to fight you and I think that has really hurt the airport\nWe've seen a number of less than a minute left but I'm just curious to get your your answer to this ... we've seen some of the recent um changes in terms of a look at the airport looks nicer than it did five ten years ago and we've seen other tweaks along the way and there's been a leadership changes\nBut what's the biggest challenge facing Mitchell international airport moving forward because it's just not what it once was and nobody can say and convince me otherwise\nRight no I agree with you a hundred percent but it's more flights it's more direct flights I mean that's the key to get direct flights execs will fight through there and you can draw more out of northern Illinois I think it's slowly working back but it really has a ways to go\nHe is mark ... editor of the marquee Business Journal by what am I on
