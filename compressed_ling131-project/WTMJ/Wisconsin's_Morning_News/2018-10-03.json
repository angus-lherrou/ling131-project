happened big announcement\nLast week for you you're you're going to be heading up to board for the Wisconsin senator district what what what does that job entail\nBasically kind of overseeing all business operations of the convention center of the panther Reno and the highlight theater so or seeing all that making sure that we're making that vow those viable entities providing things for the community of those are three great assets were place or you don't mean panther arena where um\nThe mark yet most play and certainly obviously ... answers play but bringing more energy and more conventions and really getting people expose our city was what's the convention center and then ... ... feet are of course\nBrings in some a gray concerts and has a house so many great things on time so really separate things but all under one umbrella\nCertainly it's an exciting time to just oversee that entire district how do you capitalize on some of the energy some of that heat now that it's in that region\nI've been on the board for about three years now my ... ... what we've been talking about we have a great we've had a great board um we've brought in some new leadership Marty Brooks process started about a year ago most of the day bringing that leadership and and\nKind of capitalizing what's going on we we see we see it every day there's a renaissance going on in the city of Milwaukee and it's exciting it's energizing\nAnd we feel that the next big step for us to look at what we can do at the convention center I'm Pfizer farms been a great asset and a great addition to our downtown and we see when we build and we invest in this community\nWhat happens right when you build places like Miller Park great things around there\nWith the expansion of the the convention center what's left to do their obviously besides putting shovels and the grounded what are some of the challenges you still have to overcome\nYeah I think when you talk to people I'm certainly our our legislators people now their heads when you talk about a new convention center excuse me ... expansion of the convention center they nod their heads saying and it's a good thing it's a good idea to do it our biggest challenge will be as always with these things Mike is how do how do you find it\nSo we're looking at a lot of different options are a lot of house for that I guess now I don't have all those answers just yet about the team's been working very very hard prior to this and we've had a\nLot of good studies that have been done and we've actually had some design work done already from the previous board that we looked at back in I Believe it was June which is a it's exciting to see when you you put images on paper people start getting a little more excited about it\nDo you think the center district in the convention center in and of itself is being used to its full potential or is there room to grow\nCertainly room to grow and and that's part of why we're looking at this convention center and you look at a pure cities we've kind of fall behind a little bit when you look at a convention center specifically it's a great place\nBut it can house maybe one event at a time there's not a lot of flexible space and the new designs that we worked on with some of our consulting partners kinda show more flexible space opportunities to bring in two or three spaces I receive tax and emails from people already saying hey we would love to come to the Wisconsin conventional\nCan't load and unload out fast enough for the space isn't big enough so\nIf we look and re imagine some of that stuff make it more flexible flexible you space is\nIs a big thing and and every industry right now how do you make those things work for multiple reasons and multiple occasions I think is something that we really need to re imagine ourselves and make sure it's not just for now but for twenty five years from now\nHow is the working relationship between what you're doing with the Wisconsin Center district and in other major players whether it's the mayor's office or other developers I mean do you guys work together a lot on on some of these things we\nDo and and we've actually
