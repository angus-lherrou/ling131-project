of day on Saturday mornings you just got such a great a great sense of what's going on in the business with the actual the business region\nA and as a starting point there's just so much energy right now in downtown Milwaukee and here's why\nWell Mark your folks are broken big store here in reference to the changing skyline of downtown Milwaukee once again huh\nYeah it's really something that seems like every few days is a new project for downtown but this one after admitted it very unique get day at Twenty one storey apartment building new thinking okay you know we've heard that before but in this case it's actually a would be able to get timber building\nIt would be the largest I'm Sorry the largest and the tall his temper structure building in the western hemisphere you know it'd be over two hundred and thirty feet tall it would have a couple of hundred apartments it'd be at ease ...\nAnd north named Aaron street with a former and why does this and it's very unique in that what the developer said to us is\nThat you have all these apartments that are being built on top I mean there's I mean it seems to be almost a new proposal every week he felt he needed to stand out he needed to be kind of something that would drop people and so he's going for more of an environmentally a sustainability approach of a building that would be very very very uh\nKind of interesting and very and very unique\nWell how unusual is this material this architecture for such a structure such a tall structure\nA very rare for top structure to this point they've never been taller than than than seven stories uh you have them in a number of cities and they're becoming more and more common there is a a does actually won that\nThat's close Eighteen stories up in Vancouver that's a dormitory but I hear this will be Twenty one story so the opposite opposite obviously would be bigger and it just really unique you know I think it's kind of cool for the downtown because I think what you always wanted a city is you want properties and you want products that are unique that don't look like everything else and see that's why I think people really like the\nAnd about building you know have that glass front that kind of looks out over the lake that's why people like the arena and that's why you have a lot of talk about the Iraq because it because it has a interesting book to it so I think the more books you had that really helps your overall image of a city\nYeah market business or in a which is here with our listeners has a great slideshow on your website about this in terms of it's it's certainly stands out as a memorable in terms of general I appeal it is most interesting isn't it\nIt is not looked like an average of ... it looks very different looks like something you'd see in New York are you seeing Paris ISI in London and a much larger city but here I mean if this happens if we obviously he hopes that does\nIt will be here in Milwaukee edits again in my apartment segment where are you seeing so much interest no one's building any candles anymore everyone's been the apartment so these guys really feel that they have to stand out why would I rent from one that looks the same as the other well here's one that's not going to look like you're either so I might want to read from that\nNo one no lower level before level toward degrees is going to be multi use some retail ...\nIt'll have retail it'll have a service there but yeah I think I have is I have a pool that will be but I was fascinated to have a pool that's open air in the summer and then close to the winter\nYou know getting kind of a unique experience you don't see you and we'll get like three weeks for summer so I think it's good because a lot for the rep and everything but very kind of unique dry get having a pools kind of unique but also the ability to have it as an outdoor pool in the summer and they closed one in the winter\nThis will probably be considered one of the anchors a beach town immigrate or a ... square neighborhood woman\nIt is as part of a site that's been vacant for a number of years God of the kind of that ad ... and there's a couple of other sites that you had north on banned beer and that that have been talked about for either apartments or condo so you know this growth in downtown we're still waiting to see what happens with the ... which is supposed to start construction hopefully this fall early next year\nAlong the lake front and all these other apartments kind of along the river there's so much happening you know you out for other people as well so I'm kind of what is it going to stop it out to what did you see the surge\nWe we're we're we're through at about and what's really raining and it's still happening\nYou know mark I know that you're able to get some more information with regards to Foxconn plans for down someone what you what are they saying no\nYeah we had a really touching eventually this week with\nAlan Young he's one of their head execs here in Wisconsin we sat down with them at an event and I think he talked about I thought was fascinating in that everyone knows they are now in the six eleven building on West was I'm Sorry he's Wisconsin Avenue a and he said\nThey're already looking at it they're going through the drive or actually putting people in the building and they're already realize that they need more space there looking at their options that could be an expansion of of that building it could be a new building on that parking lot which is right to the south the building it could mean\nSpace other where I'm Sorry other places in the area so I get Foxconn already paying off a region has a building and spend a lot of money to buy the building is already looking for more space in our area\nAnd speaking of Foxconn a another major health care uh agency or hospital actually wants to be part of the greater presidents amount of blood understand\nIt's just ... south you know one of the big competitor is where the roar advocate ... so I mean it is actually this is something you and I talked about and that's all the stuff that's going to happen to route box out Foxconn has a great project no doubt huge project is going to have a tremendous impact but we talk for a while about what's going to happen around it whether it's retail whether it's office whether it's housing\nWell it's going to be Thirteen thousand employees they're Thirteen thousand employees will need healthcare right so why wouldn't you put a hospital or clinic right nearby and that's what a ... had to get a rose doing and that's not what for what I think it's going to share of property line that could be right next to each other so you've got to get to choose\nI visit there I was in charge of the people are are seeing what Fox time to me and are trying to try to get it already in position to to help their business\nUh yeah it's it's a town isn't it it's a community of what's known as ...\nIt's going to be its own set me I mean it's not going to be a fish will say but it really should be because it's going to be it's going to have everything you need in terms of to live work and play yeah absolutely\nYou have to shoot names obviously highly and Amazon are they going to be a lot of clothing a lot of the Harley brand you know everybody likes to wear a highly that he could get caught like me I can pretend I ride a highly even though I Do but you know there is a highly clothing there is a highly belts there's all the merchandise a highly hats and a great way for them to help increase their sales of course is what on Amazon Amazon as the big\n... is the big one that's out there now and that's the one everybody uses so highly again as they try to increase revenue they have to look at all channels right they're not going to sell the bikes are going to sell a lot of clothing a lot of merchandise or Amazon is a great way for them to help those numbers\nI Know you're also watching the Milwaukee Brewers are posted can run very closely but as it relates to the regular season wrapping up to all of us how are they doing them in numbers there are tend to\nThey actually ended up think about the ... they were never chat and all the major leagues wow a Jew over two point eight million\nAh they beat a lot of the larger markets they'd be Philadelphia they beat Miami they beat you know a lot of other larger cities you ever think I found interesting is overall ever be was down about four or sat for tenants and walk you know it was over\n... percent third highest increase in all the major leagues so clearly having a winning team on the field helps when I think will be interesting a swan is one is I was going to get to be the playoff run and that's going to be great for the team I go to make a lot of money it's very good but having\nHaving a great you're also helps you out of your next season so I think you'll see in Nineteen you'll see an increase I tend to again because everybody is excited they have on the bandwagon and they want to be out there\nWell and also what's interesting about this current structure the playoffs every new level brings a new one terrible brings a new line above the related stuff so every time I go a bit of higher in the playoffs yeah\nYou're the hat she'll see shirt I mean I was out there this week now twice for the games that airs playoff clothing for every level for just being in the playoffs for this round for the next round for even thinking about the play offs I think there's a level of quote again it's not just

supposed to take a minute rich Hi Lynn how can we help you today Welcome to the zoo\n[laughter] Hi um I guess that Raul perennial bed around the house ah when our electric grass and the guy I'm John how far it and I generally like to leave that\nDuring the winter for the winter and trim sure but I Know a lot you know ... everything back at this time of year and\nI was just wondering is there a good rule of thumb because I Would prefer not to do it right now 'cause that look like\nThat's a good rule is um if it looks nice keep it I like that and in truth truthfully I I Believe all of that up anything that the birds could eat the winter um anything that gives me winter in interest out I Would just eagerly leave it up until spring and then\nJust make sure that you do start to cut it back before you get some new growth starting down if they're done at the ground level you want to cut that back then and so I'm a procrastinator and sometimes I don't get my grass has cut back until\nThere's eight or twelve inches of new growth and then it gets a little bit and not have rent yeah it gets a little bit it was the ... kids you know when they get the shoes yeah yeah um but the um ... as long as you get to put away um before spring gr before the new growth comes you're going to be just fine\nAnd with the ... go ahead and and break those seed heads up and left the seeds fall to the ground so you can um let them grow and become babies and then eventually big beautiful flowering purple calls are\nGreat thank you very much yeah that's a hard enough\nPower and ... and things like that on the ball right and I guess wasting my time it got dark and throw them out just throw the head out into Harry area\nFor their [laughter] uh yes they will uh um I I tend to break I just grind them up in my hands real quick just to kind of get that seat a little bit closer to the soil they may if if you just pop the head off\nAnd throw it out if that had lays up off of the ground it'll take several months if not years for that to eventually\nThe seed wound that sprout until it's in contact with soil\nOkay so the enzymes in the soil breakdown and allow the seed to to to uh be germinate\nBut uh if you if you put the grind them up in your hand a lot of those seeds will fall right down into the soil and after snow in the ... the frost cycles you'll be doing getting a lot of those seeds ... next spring\nOkay thank you so much for your time is it nice to have somebody who goes in ...\nIs doing the right thing when most of our listeners do the right thing but by listening is yes it is what I meant yeah it is I Wish we give it a shot up to the brewers they're just playing so well I just feel the need to do that little shout out yeah it's been great um [noise]\nThe great comes on I think he's doing a fabulous job it it's and it's\nJust so exciting to watch now you know the ... or you're a baseball fan or you say oh yeah yeah\nI thought so it isn't it's just so exciting to watch and and the the strategy going on now and then I keep asking myself so why don't they do that you know in the regular season so we didn't wind up you know playing what is it a hundred and sixty two games and you're tied\nYes and we ended up being a hundred and sixty there but that was going to be exciting to that it's been a very exciting for for ... and I've never seen a pitching staff managed like this I mean I think goes was doing a fabulous job and just you know they just the is changing the nature of the game yeah there's a lot\nOf good pictures and I was I was so excited that um I I was down in ... the first night when he kinda went a little they got a little rough and there and then but you know we won so I was still happy in and then yesterday they cut critic also used them again and I thought that was awesome and he did really well\nYou know the confidence exact confidence in all of his players which is really neat\nSorry one more let's go on more

talking next line is for one for seven Ninety nine when ...\nHi I'm Brett ... owner of bread I couldn't have seasonal services and only be experts here is more of a designer yard show\nOn WGM Jay\nWelcome back to your job we got almost ... we're uh\nWe're bored if you wanna call it will gets right on the air negative mortgage talking tech signed on for seven nine nine one six twenty five is you know more baseball talk for a while I'm Eric in Johnson's great Eric welcome to the designer your joke how can we help you\nYes I Know you're a couple of some of them and um I guess a lot of that I find this year and I'm like the price of them don't know when to cut those airplanes to\nI'm Sorry you want to know what to do with what like a hostile\nTo cut back I Know one of those that are doing just let 'em take its course oh yeah and one should I I'm Wondering like\n... I Would just let nature take its course eventually the leaves will kind of dry up and decay and\nThey'll release naturally and I I Am a big advocate of us especially with perennials that have just been planted 'em in the last ... you know this season or last season you don't really need to do a lot with your perennials because it gets a little you know you want them\nOnce they're really established and then growing a lot then you can be a little bit more assertive with your perennials but at this point just let those leaves fall away naturally and in the springtime you can break that up there's not much left of hostile leaves after winter anyway\nUm and then in the tulips I I Would we want to get down a little bit cooler where we're not bumping up into the fifties and sixties anymore um if you plant them too early they could start to grow it probably won't hurt them a lot\nBut I I Would wait until\nYou know probably November first late October early November certainly before the ground is frozen\nAnd then um dig 'em up ... you want about three times the diameter of the ball so if if a bald as an inch\nAn inch in diameter you want to put it down about three inches and the pointy the point the part of the bulb facing up putting up but when you're part of um a lot of ... most balls or shape somewhat like a teardrop and so the point in part goes up\nAnd then um it's not a bad idea to put two or three inches of mulch over them right away after you plant them so that the ground cools slowly and warms up\nCools slowly and warms up slowly in the in the spring and then just as you start to see those two sleeves begin to emerge you may want to rake often ensure but half of that two to three inches of bark much give them a little bit of a room and the soil warm up a little bit quicker wants to see the foliage coming up in the springtime\nOkay thank you very much very much for the ... year congratulations on the new home yeah go on this time in people's life\nIt is for a member of your first one I remember ... yeah it was just amazing accurate mortgaged architects lead is available for one for seven nine nine one six twenty and student Walker shows texted inbred\nSays it's got bare patch using shady backyard when and how to seed in the fall and with what he wants to be able to stand up to attract or more\n[noise] Mm okay so it's doing Walker job in full sun spots you can just you want to recoup and disturb the soil do so you get good seats so contact\nAnd then by a premium sunny seed mix you know he says he's got a shady S. uh I'm getting a lot of that got ya um especially with the long wet dreary days the grass is kind of given up underneath\nUnderneath the trees so ... you want to buy a premium I never go cheap and seed and um I I Do that by seed with the the mulch isn't it [noise] um okay I like to use the ... and by by my own I don't like to buy seed with anything else in it but seed\nAnd I'm so a premium quality lawn seat mix for ... shady areas\nAnd you can go ahead and and seed anything right now this is a great time\nI'm In till we get to a you know to really get to probably end of October it gets a little bit dicey mhm um but certainly through October fifteenth this but if we have a mild winter you can go a little bit I mean a a mild fall you can go a little bit longer so\nUm go ahead and get going and the other thing is with shady areas you really got to look around and and look up to see if there's if it's ever going to get enough sun\nAnd if there's a mosque growing that's a great indication that you're never going to get enough sun bowl really um to support good grass so you need to consider either opening up the canopy of the trees hiring a certified divers\nGo up in um assess you know maybe there's some ... parts of your tree that aren't as healthy as others but we're going to print out some of that to let the light through the trees or can you afford to remove\nWhen the reason I like it
