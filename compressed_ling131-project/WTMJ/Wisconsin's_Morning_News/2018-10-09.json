least one for sure there are more that died after enlisting after nine eleven and then the dot com back home it's going to do so much more than just say hey these are the names it's going to teach\nI mean they're planning on educating they want this to become like a field trip place there's going to be a place for a speaker to speak and address students or others\nI mean it's so it it just so much larger than just hey we want to put up a tombstone here or a marker is something that's going to bring a generate love in education\nAnd at the same time remind you of what happened on that day so

you don't have the same perspective and you're right and I I Believe firmly\nAnd I've already seen it happen I I've been up there a few times several times since we've taken on this initiative I saw eight year olds taking a walking field trip to the memorial and they were standing there looking at the steel being they're touching it the teacher was explaining a little bit about Andrea since she's
