Ballenger and max Muncie a couple of guys that are younger players and the Dodgers lineup but to use genes words they can match two\nMonths they've come out of the middle of nowhere Ballenger somebody laugh you know it was on the prospect radar and and it wasn't a huge prize in that regard when he went on a rookie of the year but months he's somebody who had two years in the majors with the AIDS\nAs a really light hitting the utility guy they released them Dodgers picked him up last after spring training last year he spent all of last year AAA and had a good season but didn't get a shock but the team in September started this year and AAA\nCame up a few weeks into the season it thirty five Ron Chevy ... with that became a lot more confident but it was a guy who's out of baseball\nYou know a year and a half ago and then in July and homerun derby so he's been a really critical story for the doctors to watch develop this year\nThere's a whole lot of history between these two teams the season the only face each other seven times the Dodgers won the series four games to three but you have any takeaways in terms of vulnerabilities or or advantages between the ... and the Dodgers\nI just think it's a really fascinating matchup guys with the Dodgers position players that date Roberts deploys them kind of like\nTwo lines if you put it in the hockey terms you know you got your line against right handed pitching you got your line against left handed pitcher and they're two totally different lineup surely with the only ... bean Justin turn a third man ... short and it's kind of turn into ...
