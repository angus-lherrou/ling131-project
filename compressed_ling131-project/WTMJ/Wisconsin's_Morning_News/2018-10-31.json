director of the constitution center a nonprofit think tank speaking in the wake of what President Donald Trump in to see about birthright citizenship this week hinting that he could make it go away by executive order a man who knows the was ABC News legal endless royal oaks who joins us live on WGM Jake morning Aurora\nMorning yeah big questions are are rising as to whether or not the president is right that the true meaning of the fourteenth amendment is no birthright citizenship and also process wise\nIf he wants to make a change does he do it by executive order or would Lindsey Graham have to go ahead and fulfill his promise to introduce a bill to that effect in Congress or the other alternative which would be a tough sell would be a constitutional amendment so you got huge fights over substance and process on this issue\nWell other than the birthright citizenship what else then the fourteenth amendment covered\nWell essentially the that is is the focus it says that if you're born in the United states you are a citizen of the United states and then there's the sub set to that language that says oh by the way\nThis only applies if you are subject to American jurisdiction so that's the sticking point people look at that language and say well what does that mean how does that really changed the basic part about your your baby born in the U.S you're a citizen of the U.S assuming that\nIt just because your here no matter where your parents came from the subject to American jurisdiction clause according to some means\nThat if you owe your allegiance to a foreign country than the baby born in the U.S really shouldn't\nBe a citizen back in Eighteen sixty six when we passed the civil rights act of that year and then the fourteenth amendment shortly thereafter the idea was we want former slaves and four children a slight edge\nTo be citizens we also did not want American Indians Native Americans to be citizens because we consider them subject to their tribes the jurisdiction of tribes as so that was the fight back then of course indigenous Americans were made citizens in the Nineteen twenties but that's the issue that the president wants to tee up by way of executive order we\nAre allied with ABC News legal analyst royal oaks on WGM gee we are not alone\nIn offering birthright citizenship more than thirty other countries do so most of them in the western hemisphere but it would seem that there is there are parts of this planet where this is not an option\n[laughter] that's right and of course of people criticize the president for his comments in the last couple of days where he says it's ridiculous for the nation on the planet to do as well as it turns out to thirty nations as you say including Canada do have birthright citizenship it seems that what the president is trying to do with his\nFrenzied run up to next Tuesday's mid term is to really focus on immigration issues got that immigrant caravan coming north and he's kind of portraying it like high noon wherever they just send the fifty two hundred soldiers to the border and on top of that\nIs adding the birthright citizenship issue I don't think it's a coincidence that he is putting this on the national radar screen right now in the week before the election Democrats of course say let's say about health care\nPre existing conditions in the climate of hate in the nation\nSo it's really both of a legal and political fight or you can about one thing though if he does go by way of executive order to get rid of birthright citizenship immediately you're going to see court challenges combination just like it it was the travel ban\nThe immigration issues and of course so whatever happens at the trial court level you're bound to find a judge here
