I mean it's going to have to make up Scott some bumps there's going to be an actor that there's going to be some issues that come up and and you have to learn from that you also have to look at the schedule the schedule right now is going to change I mean we're kind of what it is now that the kind of what people are going to ride it\nKind of whether whether times are really well I had a kind of what they found out I Would say is that sometimes these things run kind of later in the evening that you know\nPeople out and about ten eleven twelve o'clock are actually on them so it's going to change it and kind of learned from that kind of the kind of what we heard from other cities was kind of learn from how it operates and that kind of adjust accordingly\nYeah 'cause it's amazing we don't have to go back a few directors generous kids in Milwaukee dealt with quite well didn't\nIt did and I just think we have to get used to we have to sit there and I've had it coming coming there are all out for weeks that's been nobody out but it's been interesting to see how people react to\nEverybody's been treated by about ... what kind of running out to see a coyote what's it going to do I think a kind of want to separate running it's going to have in fact having it free is great because that helps him Milwaukee has you know everybody loves free here and I think people people are going to get to it but I guess I'm I'm saying and other cities that had issues that it's going to have some here\nMark what's your sense right now for ... quickly we're going to expand beyond the downtown a missile loop\nI think the one that's going to head towards the lake front is probably the easiest at one that'll hopefully happened over the next year or two they have to find out what's going to let the apartment building has been down at the end of it but that's already being built I think the most\nPart one is the one that would extend it from the train station to the arena ... I mean what what's going on a kind of around the arena and all the activities that having\nThat line is huge and then I think that the natural fetch and it's up in the neighborhoods up into the perverse hill neighborhood down into the third ward and into the walkers point because I think I'll be off the mark if it just ends up as it is right now is it as just one line I don't think it's going to work it needs extensions\nAnd needs to kinda to be part of the city\nThen it's important to move forward during the momentum as\nIt is I think there's a lot of momentum right now I think people people it's hard to imagine what it's like it's kinda hard to kind of ... how to ride was it up and running back first few months there's gonna be a lot of momentum that first year it's free so I think the city has to really kind of see that a kind of grab it and really wrong with it\nOK talks are underway to extend the Miller Park naming rights you know this is almost the forgotten story and special during the Pentagon says you know we're all thinking this is going to go on forever but no it's renewal downriver fills\nIt is it time and and there's no doubt that it's been a great run for both ... and four and foreign Miller course I mean people just you know just call it mellow park it's just automatically assume that it's just I mean it's really kinda neat is kind of a great partnership\nAnd it's just I mean it's really kind of need this kind of a great partnership I Would be very surprised if it was not read it but it's got to get going here and they are actually runs through twenty twenty right now it's had a pretty low cost of ... one million dollars a year for example are kind of the parents and the bucks new Web ... one of the Pfizer result\nIs over six nine so there's a there's a lot of opportunities I think here for both I think there's gonna be a lot of talk so you have to kind of play the game but there's no doubt I think in the long run it's going to be able to talk for a long time to come\nYou know what I always find interesting because the corporate world is so brand based on your brand and one's a merchandiser or products or whatever you look around the venues around the country and there's a lot of turnover on them your rights which to me I find surprising\nThere is I think it's for a couple of reasons one is the cost it's very expensive and it's\nAlso hard to measure the turnout from talking to people they say that you know how much you're trying to get for it but I think in this case it's a partnership you have Miller which is located with\nIts operations right near the stadium you have their partnership with the brewers we're known as a burn city Miller Park has been known that way forever yeah I think this one's going to have this kind of like you know you think of other standards across that country kind of work make set out in Denver with the officer corps in St Louis and I mean I think that's a natural fit and I think it's a natural want here for sure\nOkay a earnings are been released a just now originally there were as it affects a Harley Davidson I Know you're watching this story very closely ... what are the numbers telling us and what's the immediate challenge right now\nI think the challenge for them that surprise is here in our country they've had some pretty good sales growth internationally and that's what they talked about they really want to go get an ethic but here in our country if not then it's good now it's interesting that she was trying to determine if all the\nFighting at Twitter wars with the president's haven't backed out of I don't know if you can you know climate for sure but there's no doubt it's had them in the headlines attacks vicious for them\nAnd of course as the terrorists that are out there too which is a huge deal for Harley so there's no doubt it's a struggle and there and they said that the next few years are going to be a struggle for that but they feel very confident and that they're coming out with with a with a lot of products with the electric motor cycle with more marketing really try to expand their base and to both millennials and\nAfrican Americans and other minorities really trying to grow that market but there's no doubt hardly have a lot of hurdles ahead of it\nWell ... bucks have launched their beer garden tell us about a visit as

only I Know that sort of that now that the Dodgers have moved on I guess we want to despise you for [laughter] thank you ... they speaking of despite invaders um let's say that\nI've been really good at getting rid of crab grass or whatever and now I I've gotten rid of the grandparents when I got a big brown watch on my lawn what do I do\nWell so today what we're going to talk about is getting your turf grass ready for winter and and um this this summer was really tough I'm so in order to control gravy crab grass lawn care companies like ours um we put down a pre emerging crab grass preventative right in the springtime and fertilizer\nAnd what that does a lot of people don't understand how that product works but it's a grand Newell and so what it does is when it dissolves in water it it basically forums a barrier\nIn the in the top layer of the soil so that when a crab grass little baby sea that's been sitting in the soil all winter long when that sprouts\nNo I pulled up just a portion of it probably about twelve linear feet of it ... and there was this was the worst part where it almost totally died and you know and it was not return obviously I put the seat and like I say I grew to heighten button insurance stopped now it's about two months ago\nSo [noise] um my ... my thought is a lot of times that miracle grow or that beg to top so it's very it's it's fixing Dewey um it it it's in in top so our native topsoil has more sand in it\nUm yeah and it dries it drains and dries very well so you what you may want to do is is go to a garden center with perhaps like a a a\nMaybe a garbage can or a couple of buckets and get some topsoil try to find some drier Sandy or topsoil and work that in with your you don't want to necessarily remove the miracle grow topsoil at this point that'd be a messy job\nSo if you can work in some native Wisconsin topsoil from a ... a nursery they let you go in and get like a bushel basket or a couple of Bush will baskets fall rake that in work it in and then I Would see that\nI'm I'm a big fan of seed versus out any way it seems to be more durable and I'm In the other thing is is don't buy any to\nAsk your garden center what type of grass seed to buy 'em I a lot of the national brands\nThat there are so generic gym there they're designed a girl from northern Wisconsin to southern Illinois\nAnd you you know I I prefer like I I Love getting like rangers grass cedar\nGrass seeds from local ... um local blends because it's specific to our area it's a big difference between southern Illinois in northern Wisconsin where else and and anything that's designed to grow in any of those climate is probably\nNot ideal new generic to rework much right right so I'm Rick it up get some Sandy topsoil in there and ah and then receipt and ... you're not going to get in German nation out till spring more than likely although it is rather mild right now but\nMy assumption is that we probably won't get much determination to spring\n... okay thanks very much for the call we appreciate we hope and help you out a little bit\nUh let's see it's a Twenty one minutes after twelve step for message will come back and there was a

can we help here today [noise]\nYeah I wanted to write this year to a an air raid and oversee you\nKnow it's perfect time get out there today and get her done\nAll right it probably won't do it this year but it'll be ready to go first thing in the spring right\nExactly and then also and this is for you and everybody listening everybody put any seed\nDown now or if you want to put any see down in the spring do not use crab grass preventative in the spring because it doesn't rain the difference between the grass and back crab grass\nYeah I'm I'm just going to take my aunt that with the crowd route 'cause we've got about the last year but I Need to get them the real feedback in their\nExactly and that's the that's ultimately when I get some time between calls here that's where we're going to talk about the best way to keep crab grass another read the pay is to keep your lawn nice and healthy and fertilizing air rating and over seeding in the fall is a great way to do\nThat Tom thank you very much Nicole and as long as we that's on your mind going in juice\n... this is where we're getting to the end of the window on an ... until the ground\nFreezes still do machine boats were targeting ... if you're going there or if I was up in the frozen ground you know the federal a roommate okay but um ideally you probably want to do it between September fifteenth and October Fifteen\nBut um and the other thing is um if you if you do want to oversee it or put seed down with it if you do it\nLet's just say you did it on September fifteenth there is a good chance at that seed would be routing now in growing the if you wait too long All right\nIn the if you wait too long All right you're going to ... stay dormant until spring which is a good thing as okay in the middle point though sometimes what happens gym as you'll get sprouting\nAnd some of that if it's really tender it could get ... by winters rabbit ... so\nBut it's not a bad thing you still over seated a lot of that simple fall down into holes and still in and be protected it won't germinate till spring anyway mhm it's still worth it you you know you just can't control Mother Nature so you just do the best that you can\nUm if you really don't want to redo it in the springtime because even in the springtime if you don't have the German nation um [noise]\nIn you you probably want to wait 'til Memorial Day to judge the success of your German nation I see 'em you don't want to be looking in April and say oh it didn't germinate so I'm gonna wait 'til or I'm going to receive now because if if they both germinate too much grass seed as a bad thing you know\nWhat happens um if ... if it chokes itself out oh I get way too way too many roads way too much grass and it begins to choke itself out then becomes just a little bit more susceptible to issue to to trouble so we don't want that no\nAnd then the other thing is just is up until usually Halloween or around Halloween I'm even to you know maybe the fifteenth of November this was a great time to be putting down your winter riser fertilizer your last application for the phone really and in my opinion winter rise or is the best\nOr it's the most important application of the year and the reason is that it's the price of food that the plants store for the winter and you want to be able to do that or you want to be able to give them a lot of food and so when they wake up in the spring they're healthy and ready to go\nYou know there was a a this is nothing to do with laws which is a ... there was a a um an anniversary very famous anniversary this week\nYou know when it was no the twenty sixth of October\nCast your mind back how far along time\n[laughter] no I don't ... know\nI was the anniversary of the gunfight at the OK Corral oh my gosh probably the most famous shoot up that ever happened\nI should know that I Love movies like why are we uh uh that's a great movie yes\nThe ... the reason was losing ... ... ... it wasn't even when the blade went\nWell you you're kinda answered my question already when you're talking about over sitting um [noise] but uh to expand on that or more do you have to make the wand over seated\nYou do um and the reason is is you need seed the soil contact for seeds germinate the enzymes in the top soil will um helped penetrate the show of the seed so some people just try to spread it on their grass what happens in most of it will lay there and I'm raft\nUh some of it will fall down and actually touching lay on the soil some of that will germinate but it's a very small percentage so we do recommend air rating first and it's a great way to kind of prep pair of the soil for additional a grass growth as well\n... we appreciate that called thank you for calling in all let me see a wall e and received their way for a long time Hi Wally thanks\nFor being with us hey thanks for ... and early\n... thank you I have a few burning Bush is they've been neglected I'm ... years\nAnd they are blocking a sight out of my windows okay so I was wondering when I'm when and how much can I Try I'm All right well I can see out the window right now it's probably a foot and a half to two feet above you know the bottom fell\nRight so the window I Would wait till spring or at least wait till around Christmas Time because we want to make sure that they're they're dormant in earlier I sing after Thanksgiving and again with a with any plan we want to make sure that there is totally dormant before we proved them\nAnd then some of the heavy do two things now bring Bush's or a little bit different than lilacs or dog would write Burnham in that they have one or two trunks and that's it\nAnd so you don't go down to the ground and begin cutting stems away what you want to do is you want to look at the plant and you're gonna so let's say that it is it four feet tall\nOh no oh there are at least know oh I Would say seven seven feet moral my needed them all yeah\nYeah so these are these aren't compact there more of a standard burning Bush so [noise]\nUm what I Would do is go in and you want to look down maybe at at two feet off the ground and see if you can make one cut and pull out a ... a ... that whole branch\nAnd then make another cut and pull out that whole branch and carefully remove maybe three or four branches at about the one or a about the two foot level and then okay once you pull that way now looked at the three foot level and cut out two or three branches there and what you're going to do now\nIs your reducing the overall mass of the plants\nYes that Mary yeah right right and\nAnd so and then you do that maybe four feet and then at five feet and so what you're going to have is you're going to have cuts a multi ... at varying levels and then when you get to the final later you're going to have if there are some tips up there and I would maybe even do this in the spring after at least leaps out\nUh-huh then at that point what we've been talking about up until this point has been proving at that point you're going to share it or\nThe chips are home really it just to bring the height down we often that we've proved it to the Senate and then you can share it to shape it\nLater you don't want to you don't necessarily want to share first because Jim as we're pulling out those during heights of branches we're going to be pulling out what you've shared anyway so what's that will do is it'll open up the plan to get more new growth growing in at the different levels and then also you'll you'll have\nYou'll be bringing it back under control you may want to do that over multiple years to okay\nThank you very much for the call and uh let's see we the phone number is accurate mortgage truck and tax I'm for one for seven nine nine ones are
