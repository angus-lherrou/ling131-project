I mean if you look at it obviously Miller Park out of the name for a meal of course where they had actually handed out free beer\nAs a result of Iraqis series and that was great for the brand and great for them but even things like a war of putting some of their new babies ... outfits right after they were born and even at the stadium you're seeing them\nYou know from Scott's controls\nTo other team their names on national television they're getting a lot of buzz out of this I think it's good for the city but I also think it's really nice for the Brandt\nYeah basilica lose to this quite a bit the fact that you know winning baseball uh down through the years historically has said so just social impact on society and that does\nIt really has if you think about I mean I've covered the birds and watch the brewers for years I Can't remember if such excitement over a team\nYou know I mean it's hard to remember back to ... to it and I'm sure there was but that that that social media and all that stuff that's going on so it's good for city economically it's great we have a lot of\nLA fans in the town this week and spending money at national media but you're also seeing walkie all over the national scene so that's great because it obviously wines are ... and kind of wines are reaching hopefully people will come they're\nJust kind of thing wedding sports is great for city\nI've been following your coverage of the greater Milwaukee foundations on the table or upcoming events I'm fascinated by this I think the terms of public discourse this was a really a creative concept\nIt is actually without one earlier this week it was an ear of these ah I was at one where they were like up to the probably like three hundred people that are split at tables\nAnd it was eight or nine people at a table and you just talk\nAnd it talked about issues you talked about diversity you talked about technology has talked about the kind of the millennials you talked about everything and it was people that was late for me was it was people that you don't normally see at about say where people from all the committee\nFrom all areas of community for all ages ethnicity and the whole work so it's a great way and that's often leads to things that I Know last year that there was a lot of talk about having things happened outside of the downtown area and we obviously seen some of that in terms of moving deliver it but I just think it's good to get people around the table to talk\nYou know it's amazing even you know and and you cover this all the time business leaders oftentimes they they do business over lunch there's something about sitting at a table and sharing food or a beverage that causes people to relax and to be forthcoming\nRight it does I think it's also having that dinner or having that Neal in this case with somebody you don't normally talk to with an individual from another era the community from other industry\nAnd just kind of having a discussion about kind of things you seek out of things that they see I see a lot of respect that these events like kind of for each other and for the other opinions I think you don't feel fail out of nowadays I just think it's great for the city to have these because it brings up a lot of issues\nAnd really all I was a lot of people who are always involved to get involved\nNow you took part in breaking of bread during one of the preliminary events what am I correct on October seventeenth is one of the large gathering throughout the region is going to occur do I have what\nThey already had one earlier this week and that was October seventh and more so that was kind of the ones that they're facing I'll also roll up in the larger and larger issues sunny I think you'll see a lot of discussion about this over the last couple of months\nIn terms of public policy ultimately coming forth from is do you see this is slowly evolving something's just going to be ongoing\nYeah I see it happening every year it's been so successful and it's really I think it'd be more beamed\nAs a kind of evolving and and the people will talk about specific issues more so right now is pretty broad yeah but I think it's just good to get people to get around the table and advocate discussion kind of like the old failing deal you know we all grew up that way where you sat down with mom and dad day and they talked about how the day what we don't see that as much nearly anymore\nWhile they taught us how the oldest woman for right third guy that I still remember that\nOK northwest of mutual is new uh seven Seventy seven luxury apartment a a initiative it's really something to behold but in terms of larger you know downtown residential scheme of things sounds is going to fit in what's it twice\nIs on the upper there is no doubt this is a a probably probably one of the nicest building in the city you know complete with that's with the thirty fifth overlooks downtown beautiful views has the pool exercise room everything you want in terms of luxury but much of a high end but it kind of rhymes with what I was you and I talked about that this residential exposed\nIt's in the downtown area which is really good with say this I'm sitting on the high end but you know we're seeing we talked about the one last week from New land where they wanted to build the Twenty one storey apartment building on the former Eduardo site so more and more people want to live downtown want to spend their money don't want to be down down and that's great for the city\nNow does this movement in this urban attitude cross different generations or is it a lot of retired successful people\nWhy they got the ... of the northwest mutual it's more on the other end because you have to have a lot of money to live there there's no doubt about that but I think just overall scheme as a kind of on both that you have the millennials who love to live down town do you do not have a car or walked over to lift places but I have your people like me who have moved back\nDown town who whatnot back but who move down town just because we want a new lifestyle we want to live near where we work we want to live near where we shop we wanna walk places and it's just kind of I think it's neat to see that throughout the throughout the city of throughout this area you see a lot of age variance in ... which I think it's great\nScreenwriter filmmaker VR successful John Ridley or has not forgotten who's market roots and as you well know because you've been hitting hard on this story doing some pretty cool to pass brewery complex or talk about that a little bit\nWell you open the studio actually on friday and he's he's in town for it but it's really about kind of the economics of city bringing a focus right back to the city\nIt's called no studios but it really is you know it's got a screening room it's going to have aren't related offense she's going to actually have some actual production there but it's about economic impact you know over the years we've seen I've\nHad very slowly growing film industry in this area we see the very successful film festival this is kinda next step to bring a guy like him who's gonna credibly successful with his career\nTo bring some of his money and some of his focus back into the city he's working with critically on this project I think it's just neat because one of one of the areas that the two because it really shows off the city and shows up at a uh an industry that's not that well known\nAnd met collaborative effort by filmmaker John Ridley a

yeah banks live our and\nGo brewers there you go let's go to a lacrosse have Chad what's up you're on WGM Jay money\nBig worn a gentleman my question is not necessarily based heating and cooling as it is a water eating\nUh we've been in the same home or about sixteen years and have the same water here however I recently noticed that um it fluctuates and recharge your water temperature of sometimes seeming that um we haven't used a hot water\nOr or maybe eight to ten hours that the temperature of the water got always wore\nA one or what you think the cause of it is and like a editor or a new water here\nWell first of all first of all do you have a gas water heater and electric gas it is okay yes the thermostat inside that the water heater could be you know that there were standing there could be acting up I'm causing it to a to do that and that's most likely what it is how how old did you say it was\nWell we've been on the house for about six years and it's the same water so that that edge I'm not sure house was built in the seventies so I'm assuming it's been replaced some um but um I Know that we've been on for a sixteen years at the same order your\nSixteen year old water heaters that surprising in itself most of them most of them don't last that long today um I'd probably look at look at that look at maybe getting something a little more energy efficient but if you're seeing fluctuations um\n[noise] I don't know what what's probably happening is when you turn the ... when you start using water you're ... you're stirring up the water in the tank and then the thermostat sensing that when it goes when it's still you know you're you're going to have have the issue so I'm guessing that gas control there's a gas ... on there which is also the thermostat could have just has\nA little die on the front and they're not\nThey're not always the most accurate especially at sixteen years\nSure sure I think the recommendation from a plumber years ago and I do drain it every now and then a however I don't remember what the plumber actually mentioned can be worth your bandages to draining it I guess the most recently I thought if I trained at than buttery store it so\nThat that might work out um can you explain or speak to the advantages to training at every now and then of all that stuff problem or is basically an age of your water heater problem\nI don't think it's going to do anything for the temperature issue but the reason people have recommended a plumbers have recommended flushing or draining water heaters sediments scale out of it and you know I mean there's a nice guy that I've had some plumber say\nDon't ever do that and I've had other plumber sake you know it's a good idea so um I don't recommend one way or another it's it's personal preference I guess but ah flushing the water heater is one of those things you probably should just talk to your plumber or if you've got a local farmer there talk to him see what he says and explain your situation and I'm sure they can help you out with that water heater\nSleep on the line from heating and air he's here till eight let's get him going let's give him working at for one for seven

... believe it or not that's usually the the\nThe a little bit more of a quiet time but if you do spring and fall you're going to get rid of those two periods of of weeds and so yes it's a good time right now but dude work at a pretty quick because as we begin to get a lot of frost\nOkay there's two there's two things that happen to number one it's a ... kill some of the weeds at your weed

handle the move\nWell make sure that you I Would bringing in and maybe bring it to the garage for a week or to get near a window but not right directly in a window what you want to try to do is slowly adapted to the warmer\nConditions of the house so this is a good time to be bringing those plants in because well our furnaces are beginning to run a little bit more regularly but um and then what I Would do is put I put the pot on a big saucer\nAnd then a\nWater it sparingly put put some water in the sauce or underneath the plant so that there's a lot of evaporation of water in the vicinity of it and then just cross your fingers I see\nIt I mean we may have me has a really nice high business plant that she keeps outside and she just brought it in this week and\nIt's going to lose leaves I'm you know but we keep it somewhat moist don't over water and then you know I'm I'm not a house plant dire tropical ... I I don't know that much about it but the trick is is to just let it had to retire for the winter\nAnd it will tend to move through a cycle where it's going to it's going to\nQuiet down a little bit it's not going to be putting out a lot of new grow as we get closer to spring and you get more daylight it will begin to wake up and get a little bit more robust however it's not going to lose all of its leaves and be like a ... tree all winter long it's it's going to have\nLeaves and perhaps some flowers but it's going to be minor because we just don't have enough daylight to to keep it unless you want to get grow lights and working with grow lights but a such a slow transition into the house and and keep it moist\nSo to slow transition into the house and and keep it moist but not not soggy\nOkay and let's say we have time for a call done in Richfield done good afternoon welcome to the desert here Joe how can we help you\nAre you taking my call I got some a river birch trees spring

needed to drain\nOkay for the winter but I get it in the ground and then put about three inches of of of mulch on top of it right now and they're in the springtime as we begin to warm up sir pulling the mulch away a little bit so that the soil can warm up\nAnd then try to put them in their final resting place or their final planted location you're all of them before they begin to leaf out\nOkay

was known as the question of ours Hi Mike welcome to the designer yard Joe\nHey guys I'm Glad I have a question about the over ... is it possible to over water them Italy is like where they're they're starting to get brown a in the middle also\nOkay so the brown we're going to talk about this because we're getting some calls and some tax about yellow wing needles inside of pine trees in Arbor right is right now and that's completely normal um okay the ... again\nIt's normal if it's happening for normal reasons [laughter] so but boy that's clear at this time of year I'm Arbor fighters in pine trees their interior needles begin to yellow and then they'll drop away and that's a normal it's likely drop in in deciduous trees\nSo it is possible to over water or providers and you may get some of the yelling in the middle when they're under stress too so I Would just keep a close eye on him and I'm assuming you're in ... in heavier clay soils\nYes so I my answer to it can you over water in Arbor by the is\nUnlikely if you're in Sandy gravelly soils but likely if you're in heavy clays water retaining soil so\nI Do not water but understand that there probably that's probably the natural if they're nice and yellow if they're turning straw yellow that's okay it's normal process but if you want somebody to come out and take a look please give us a call\nOkay and we will be right back
