Russian Jew might putting all my stuff into a criminal database that could be busted for something I guess I'm a little reluctant to spit too\nYeah well you know what a lot of this is the DNA testing of course coming back into the forefront again with Elizabeth Warren and um\nYou know the President Trump and all that stuff but here's the deal with these DNA tests so I was a scientist recently studied ah about a million and a half of them a million a quarter of them and they analyze that about sixty percent of us can be identified through these DNA cats\nSo you know you're you're talking about you do put it in there and you they are finding people like the Golden State killer um and and and information like this and there you can be identified up to a third cousin which again we had to do a quick um run down in the newsroom today but the third cousin is\nUm I Want to say your your\nSecond cousins kid so it it gets it gets confusing awhile but because most of us do have European ancestry um you can identify who these people are and you know one of the DNA tests or says it's sort of like the layers of an onion you know the further you get away you can actually go in and find more and\nHere's an example though how some people are using these okay this is a personal story\nI'm On my father in law got a phone call recently who said it was from our son and it said a grandpa grandpa I've I've been in jail I Need help I Need money um I you know I've been arrested for a DUI\nAnd my father in law said what and he started going off and then suddenly he was like something doesn't sound right so he said\nI'm ... what's your middle name\nAnd the guy couldn't answer and hung up the phone so father in law called us my husband called the police and the police said yeah there are crooks who are using some of these you know DNA testing and other things that they've found on line to identify names in families and then trying to scan people in that way wow and\nReally scary I only value anymore it seems like ... and we are data that that's all anybody wants from us as we are data\nIt's you know what it is it is true and it's like the more you put out there on line the more that I'm ... that the more that you take that risk another story again and I don't want to do this all about anecdotal evidence but I was at AT T mobile store yesterday and there was a guy there was a customer and he said I'm In\nI Am in um cyber security and I will tell you right now if you have what's app on your phone\nThat is an invitation he said more than any other app on your phone that is the most taxable and that is the most that people are looking at\nOh so it could have been that I mean that's another thing too and I can totally anecdotal but the guy was there he you know he he was buying a boat and he was like I Will never ever have what's up on my phone yeah because of because of what people can find out in there but you go to these DNA ancestry sites and you think well what what is that what is it what's the big deal about\nI'm a swab gene you can send it in chances are somebody in your family already has sent that already knows who you are related\nTo
