not been evaluated by the food and Drug Administration this product is not intended to diagnose treat your prevent any disease\nWelcome to the nutrition invasion by purity products giving special insight into the world of health and nutrition now here's your host pat\nWe've got another fascinating show wind up for you to the bill sorry was dirty products is going to join us in just a moment easier to tell us about a major breakthrough in the field of health\nAnd beauty it's all about a prescription medicine long used in Europe that manages main related health issues both functionally and has medically\nWe're talking things like those visible veins on the legs like spider veins all the way up to issues like those occasional emirate flare ups in fact this is so popular in Europe that literally millions of people are prescribed\nAnd have been for many years what the big breakthrough is still going to swing here shortly is that this is now available in the U.S in the form of a prescription free dietary supplement called new for print\nBrought here by ... products and when you hear what this can do you're going to be amazed\nSo joining us to explain all the detail all the great science is bill ... bills author and he's also a high level advisor in product developer for purity products a leading direct to consumer provider cutting edge specialty supplements were more than twenty five years before we got a lot of ground to cover today Welcome aboard\nWe do and it's all from Mother Nature and purity product list is no the print and of course you get it right away it's something that relief discomfort\nWell bill that that sounds exciting right off the bat but let's get right down to business millions of Americans both men and women are dealing with issues related to their vein health whether it's unsightly spider veins swelling in the legs and they just come to that comes along with the word casual hemorrhage bottom line\nWe've got tens of thousands of miles of veins running through our body in like everything else they endured the wear and tear of aging and it seems like no one's really talking about this issue much less offering options ... manages so what's the problem and watch this breakthrough from Europe\nWell the breakthrough of course this prescription an era when over the counter here and of course it's been used for fifty years safely will expand on that as we talk a little bit more about it and what is it well it's a wonderful well that's the risk he'll extract it I mean it\n... them up so that they will work to push that what we've got red noses the blue hose the arteries and the thing that we've got to push that the Canadian blood and where does it pool obviously in the bottom half of our body and it's got to get pushed up through it back to the heart\nAnd if those things are weak and the\nThe blood pools we only have a these problems tightly Bain spider ... we have a whole issue of circulation we've got to get that circulation going and uh aside from standing on your head the\nWay to do it is new print H deep now we mean I Do that is that does the same does that they use in these wonderful clinical studies that they're laid out all over my desk here so I can remind myself of all the wonderful science it's been done over the years since the Nineteen seventies\nA wonderful actress peel extract that helps your veins get strong so they can do the work of pushing and getting that circulation back to your heart again that your circulation is optimal and you know this the ingredients in this wonderful a new print HD\nAlso helps your blood vessels why it creates a little gas called nitric oxide we'll talk about it a little more\nBut it dilate so why the blood vessels so in those little tiny arterial that are just hear them but they white and that's that's in our eyes and our brain and are critical little issues that we need this great circulation so\nIt works in more than one way\nI noticed is much more than just a cosmetic issue but there's no doubt spider ... where are those visible veins you see on the legs are definitely a big issue for both genders may be more for women\nI sometimes see ads for those creams that promise to reduce spider veins and they're not cheap so I think the jackpot with this appeal to directly address the issue especially if it's helping to address the underlying\nThe spider Bain's there there's a lack of circulation in that area on the legs and so it's making new ones to try to to branch out\nAnd make sure that this is all happening so we we want them to receipt of course and we live in an era when this should be happening because we become stationary we call it sedentary were sitting at desks or a great deal of the time were not\nWalking and moving our legs and it's actually the muscles in our cats\nThey're actually squeezing on the plane and then there are one way checked valves in our day and so the the the blood only goes one direction but knew the print HD addresses the real root cause of this but the issue is it shouldn't be happening that the main should be strong enough\nTo make sure that that blood doesn't cool and it does get pushed back\nInto the heart so that we can get oxygen aided blood so this is an issue of circulation and we certainly want to promote good circulation address the real cause\nAnd of course what's interesting is in Europe it's been used for fifty years well documented and of course it's affordable and today purity product is offering the audience a chance to even try it for free so\nIf we have a wonderful remedy the ingredients is the ... electric called die off a horse chest ... extract\nAnd another ... peel extract a call ... three doses three ingredients three kinds of ways to get at these things and make them stronger and tighten up the capillaries the capillaries or the connector is between the red and blue hoses\nUh that's where the oxygen is exchange where nutrients get in were waste material comes out and those can actors can get loose and therefore a genetic so on will explain more of that as we go on but certainly this wonderful remedy from purity product new book print\nHD from purity product is the answer\nThe cause of what is the origin of these spider they even have rights because that's the main problem also\nI think all of us in the kind of lifestyles we're living we're gonna have some symptoms of this we're gonna be in a static environment where we can't move around too much and for hours and hours that blood is going to a pool and the lower half in our legs and so I'm gonna get swelling and so on\nOf course it's just overlook in Europe it's that prescription we talk about well it's not that costly there here it's over the counter all you need to hear as well what kind of symptoms of I having why should I use this and of course we're reporting all the good science for the medical literature over the years\nAnd this started in the Nineteen Seventy\nSome line we have over four decades abusive there's millions of prescriptions it's just been overlooked we love talking about this story because for a lot of people it's the first time\nThey've ever heard that something can be done about your spider thing about the discomfort about swelling ... about your limb system where we're talking about things were the days get weak way down into the small blood vessels we want to make sure that good circulation we have a return system\nTo the heart to do that\nWe want to strengthen up those they were these wonderful sisters steel extracts\nBig ingredients ...\nSo do I I just want to mention will give up the phone number at the end of the program here so don't go anywhere [laughter]\nGeez you're just shooting and we're speaking with Bill sorority on behalf of purity products we're talking about an amazing products cool new reprint we should have some pretty extraordinary things for our circulation are appearances you've heard even camera wage if you're on lucky enough to be doing with that\nNow bill before we for the disgust a link to them or what is used I Want to ask you about ... because earlier you mentioned the new prince is also good for the loop system too right so why is that so important\n... systems kind of the garbage system it take stuff out\nAnd and yet that circulation going so that are just things that we dispose of our body's lymph system is there for that and of course you've got to get that worked and so it goes along\nWith the venous system because it's part of the returns system is to get things disposed of into our system so that it is that the cells clean themselves up as a limb\nIs there to make sure that we have a good immune system too because it takes things away and so\nIt's all part of great circulation in our body and and we want those things we want to remain healthy but then when you have these things well don't wait until this becomes unsightly and then\nIt's just cosmetic makes you do it all of that coming from week Bain's in the legs so I didn't stand this and of course what's that tell you and of course we want to get these blood vessels\nExpanding dial eating and that that's the the other part of it we didn't understand early on is it it's not just making the bane stronger it dilate said why this these small blood vessels to make sure\nThat we really do get the micro circulation weigh eight\nSo you know it's pretty amazing how all of these issues are inter related I mean smarter veins hemorrhage swollen into the legs the\nThe ... will beans I Love how this all comes together with the same mechanism of action addressing all of these things the frankly well nobody ever really seems to talk more specially supplements it's really all about optimizing your circulation might do it\nIs we want to be elastic our body needs to be elastic our main needs to be elastic and of course to do that we're talking about the print HD to do it the ingredients that we have a maintaining tone in these days we want lakes that are smooth shape like\nWe want beauty in our legs we want to look good we wanted to do all these things looking good needs help and you're healthy or beans are going to be evident that's the issue you can start doing something about this today I'm just looking this was in\nThe first use of the ingredients\nIn ... this was in the bulletin of the federal society\nOf gynecology an obstetrics in France in Nineteen Seventy one and what did they use it for heavy lake during the ... so you see they they didn't even start out with spider ... it was on heavy legs and that that fluid it's cooling and they're low half of our body\nWe want to know how in the world that happen well it's because your veins got week there's is something you can do about it you don't eat a doctor's prescription and it's affordable and available to you today and the same doses they've used in the clinical study\nPurity products now making it available it's called ... H. D.\nSo now I just want you to clarify something for folks listening to your you've mentioned a few times that these ingredients are actually available as the prescription pharmaceutical in Europe which\nObviously speaks volumes modest effort to see it when I just want you to explain to people that well it's technically a prescription drug in Europe\nIsrael was a dietary supplement your in America is in this combo as an extremely well documented record of affected this clinically now I Know a lot of people here prescription and it might be saying oh\nThis might be too strong for me but the reality is these are plant based compounds\nWhich are from citrus fuels was a very well understood mechanism of action right\nIt is and certainly it's been used a well for for decades now they've been positive studies over the years and these are quite a few studies I Would say two hundred up and it's hard to sort through just to see\nHow effective this has been over the years there we now realize it has a greater effect it creates this nitric oxide gas to the white and our blood vessels and that sends a hell of a signal throughout our body because once that's going on\nWhite then it activates her body to make certain antioxidants and so on to protect us so it's very important for our good health\nTo have all these wonderful benefits and it's real obvious were sedentary society we're sitting at our desks were standing in a static way so that we're not getting these muscles in our likes to push everything back and of course over time these these Bain's become weak weak and

and raised three children during that time\n... ... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose I mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that Amy oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right to your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain okay I took any oil\nAnd glucose me mhm I use Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay realm Elaine that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic sulfur that is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding repairing our joints\nAnd salad I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has no odor it's Greece list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain and doesn't irritate you scan goes in Fifteen minutes later you have frankly\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and show and I had right because it rice\nAnd I have this year by the way of folks were costs me cream comes in a plastic dispenser that has a pump top on it at\nThe top and it occurred you'll need one to two pounds depending on the area okay off pay up our nation that sanitary you know ... so you have to worry about it becoming a rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body than um you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also maybe I'll read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply the cream to that area that you're going to target mhm okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body feels itself provided you get it the raw materials that needs and giving you what you made for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that seal okay\nAnd this is safe enough and you have to worry about I have\nTo worry about a thing that you're taking a drug for pain it long conflict with that at all none of these bogus\nGoing to have it okay so what what is then a a realistic expectation if somebody calls today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell them\nI Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you're going to notice that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminated okay and then over time you're going to rebuild and repair your joined flip that inflammation being taken down\nThat's going

feet and legs they usually and pain from being overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas I'm able to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nJust one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a miracle and a two that truly does take away the pain\nWorks as nothing else I've ever tried to work quickly and eliminated all of the pain is out to me you know\nThese are these you do these kinds of responses unusual\nNo really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart glad to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails or these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have he's my great results\nGreat I also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call give that to you know it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\nAs we've been talking about

six seven\nNine seven zero nine or give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine [noise] so\nWhat do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that perhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there but\nLooking at it from a natural standpoint and Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again that when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have\nThe problem and again we've been talking about Dr ... cream and this is\nThis is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and there's this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme in is how minimal it is it's going to get you with me\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer take your pain from like ten to five and ... on the line with continuous use mhm I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand what it was a very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Janet\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried all the right things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't\nWork first of all the little cousin ... or ... for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the airline industry here taking into early to remind people gave up\nFor six seven nine seven zero nine\nAnd remember you have

the grade children are afraid of death and so are their parents\nIn fact one of the great fears of children is that their parents will die or that they will go away and not return or they would break up with one another and rent a beautiful little family or something will happen that will bring about change which almost always producers fears in children just as it does in older people\nAll the

disappear\nFear and be a gift from God it can wake you up they can jog your loose from your complacency it can turn you from fiction the fact it can bring you back to reality but fear will never make you strong and take something house to make a strong\nFaith makes people was wrong\nNot any old kind of fake ... faith in God that is for real it's not just a vague feeling about God but actual face confidence and got crushed and God even closeness to guard\nWhich is more than ... piety because it is a deeply felt conviction on which you paint your life\nThat pain when did this faith in God\nContrary to what some people say and think faith does not eliminate fear faith in God takes fear and channels it in the right direction fear destroys and face saves\nUh thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine and go back to um I think if I'm remembering correctly about when I was seven ... and um I was going through some rough times are in my life and I started to have nightmares ... when I Would have these\nDreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you couldn't get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from his dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half a week and half asleep and I would see the shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was that I had a closet that didn't have a door so dark um and I\nHad a a Barney Rubble nightly\nMatter that I don't yeah I had like night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it helped and sometimes it cats odd you know shadows on the wall but what happened is I was going through this period of when I went to sleep I Would have this dream\nAnd I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and for boating\nAnd I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things away [laughter] and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now and lay me down to sleep and I knew the Lord's Prayer\nAnd so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick\nAnd I would take these\nBricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it's like a pillar of ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears of that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear\nAs well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see a childish technique because now that I think about it ... it probably wasn't that bad of a thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that I had these kind of foreboding fears and and how he handled it\nAs you look back on that as an adult do you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector\nYeah for me it's interesting with prayer it\nAs a as a Lutheran a lotta times will say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realized that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that\nMost of the time still oddly enough I I use prayer when I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep\nPrayers about the only effective way for me to to do that so it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude in it actually is is is powerful yeah\nWhat'd you say fear is a bad thing I guess you know what kind of fear\nIs it and who you ask probably so when I was a little kid I felt that that fear was bad maybe a it was my subconscious working out the issues that I was going through so maybe it was good but as an adult\nI I found that that fear actually can be good obviously fear helps to protect us from things that you have that that a fight or flight syndrome that we did a hill and fair exactly sort of healthy fear of of things that would do damage to you I also think that when it comes to fear that\nIt is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that we remain faithful to God's ... and then there is I'm not like a horrifying kind of fear but a fear when we look at it God in who he is honoring him and that's a kind of fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive\nFear as well yeah actually the first use of the law would be an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place the curb\nThat yeah restrained you from acting out on whatever simple impulse you might have that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy a fear to have\nYour ... like the the the first use of the law um why do people\nObey the law in in that sense\nIt's because they're fearful of the negative punishment [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm I'm not going to do this because I don't wanna go to jail so you're not really\nA doing things for a wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the penalty but at the same time it's not like the man trying to keep you down you know I mean it's it's really about\nProtecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so\nWhile there's fear involved the overall goal isn't simply tear the\nOverall goal is to Maine taint peace and to keep us ...\nUs protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me death is one kind of loss okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to loss or death being probably the largest one but\nYeah I I Would say that the death is a former law and and if you think about it that way that many of our fears are connected so uh we're fearful\nIf we're going to lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship\nWith someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose part of our identity you know or part of our freedom\nUm all of those I think go back to last for me and made it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of loss of of\nOf many times his his been something that that I've dealt with over my life I it it also I think it exposes the fact that maybe we think that the things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world\nAnd if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God and those types of fear\nIt seems to me that fear could also be a result of uncertainty not knowing where things are going to go and so you fear what could happen\nThat exactly I I'm I'm One of those people that I I I'd probably do\nMyself a harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can imagine like forty different horrible things that could happen [laughter] you know I'm so uh I\nI tend to I tend to let my mind think through those things and sometimes I'll notice that that will that will actually impact me emotionally that I Will be fearful about a consequence that I have\nDetermined to simply be a possibility in my mind and trying to realize that there's there's plenty of real things to be fearful about instead of just being fearful about the thousand things that I make up [laughter]\nIn his sermon Dr Hoffman says when fear is so thick you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is a God and where God is no fear\nNow I couldn't agree with that more you know as we're talking about this I only thought of the illustration as I was coming down here about the story of when I was a child\nBut thinking about that statement and also thinking about some forty six and that he's using is that a ... you know kind of thing I thought well I Know of course I didn't know this but uh in a way I was kind of building a fortress yeah we'll for her ... her ex yeah with prayer\nBut that is true in the darkest times God is that defense he is that lights that cuts through that darkness we also know from scripture that a lot of times we don't necessarily see the light of God in less it's dark\nOr to put another way we see it more clearly are more brightly or when it's dark\nSo ... it's interesting that when you talk about faith and you talk about people's relationship with God through Christ that if you ask them to tell you a story about it many times are going to tell you a story about darkness\nA story about fear a time when God made a difference in their daily life so in many ways without these signs of fear without the times of broken it's without these times of darkness\nMaybe we wouldn't understand God's graciousness and provision as much as we do today\nTo learn how you can support them worldwide outreach a Lutheran our ministries go to lose the run our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's one eight five five five six for six three one six\n... be removed and do the mountain speak carried into the midst of the seat\nWhat kind of talk is dead anyway when we're surrounded by all kinds of possibilities that strike fear into the hearts of people and even terrified them to death\nWith all the other fares there's always the fear of death it hard to people from the cradle to the grade children are afraid of death and so are their parents\nIn fact one of the great fears of children is that their parents will die or that they will go away and not return or they will break up with one another and Rick a beautiful little family or something will happen that would bring about change which almost always producers fears in children just as it does in older people\nAll the fears are really members of the ... fair the fear of death\nThat explains why people don't like to talk about that what they talk about it they try to make it seem pleasant when they know otherwise\nThe Bible does not blink at talk of debt it faces dance with a clear I and it calls dad an enemy talk about change that changes everything that changes things for people who die and it changes things for people who are left behind\nFear is a fact of life is not all bad it keeps a child who is burned his finger on the stove from doing it again fear it keeps us from all sorts of rash and reckless actions\nFeared drives people to see the doctor for it keeps people from going to see the doctor for fear of what he will tell them they pretend that the pain isn't there are they act as if it will soon disappear\nFear and be a gift from God it can wake you up they can jog your loose from your complacency it can turn you from fiction to fact it can bring you back to reality but fear will never make you strong and take something house to make a strong\nFaith makes people strong\nNot any old kind of fate that faith in God that is for real it's not just a big feeling about God\nBut actual face confidence and got crushed in God even closeness to guard which is more than ... piety because it is a deeply felt conviction on which you bank your life that face when did his faith in God\nContrary to what some people say and think faith does not eliminate fear faith in God takes fear and channels that in the right direction fear destroys and face saves\nFace saves people by overcoming the frenzy I fear which is unhealthy and destructive turning the face of fear in the right direction which is called God\nFace turns people away from themselves toward God it may sound unrealistic and foolish to some people actually it's the only real an intelligent way to live\nI Wish I could tell you how often I prayed with people\nWho are scared to death as someone close to them as being carried into a hospital unconscious and placed into the intensive care unit hovering between life and death the whole family stood around in the horn way young and old not knowing which way to turn all kinds of fears were all over the place\nThen we prayed to God quietly confidently altogether\nYou have to experience something like this to feel the piece that settles on that same fears may still be there but they are no longer in control something else has taken place faith takes over and people put their fears into the hands of God\nThat's not just a religious feeling are pious talk when fears so thick that you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's like again no matter what may happen there is God where God is no fear\nGod is a refuge and strength of our presence help incredible therefore we're not we fear though they may be removed and do the mountains we carried into the mix of the sea\nFaith in God punishes pier and pointed in the right direction the direction is toward God fear of God becomes\nHealthy thing when you have faith in God with faith in God and ugly fear that goes very well with pay people begin to see things again with a clear I entered take things with a clear mind it's a good thing to fear the devil but you've got to know where he's at\nWith faith in God you know where he's at\nThe great thing about God is that he shows us where he's at where the devil is at and where we're at in relation to God and to all the forces which are rise to deceive into trouble lost that great God sent his son Jesus Christ into the work\nHe rented came the story is there for all to hear all to read all the seat mysteries about God there's none of us understands\nAnd mysteries about Christ that nobody can explain but there's no mystery about who Christ is and what price did there's no mystery about who crashed isn't money is always doing he died for the sins of the whole world he did that for all\nFor the sake of his son the great God gave us the citizens of our humanity whatever they are if for some all he does this for the sake of his son who died for us as a sure sign that God forgives\nThe great guard raised his son from the dead and gave him a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every nation that takes place devolved than the DeJesus\nIt takes face to ask God for forgiveness\nAnd it takes ... forgiveness for the sake of Jesus Christ it takes faith in Christ\nWhich is not content justice saying nice things about God in Christ but actually powers that need before him it takes face to see yourself both as I said and just sitting there in the site of God save by faith in God's great hot\nAnd moved into the right direction by a holy fear of God which is cruel recognition of your own humanity along with love for God which has plenty of room for wholesome all of his sovereign power and his overwhelming grace all of which you see in his son Jesus Christ\nFaith in God that he is truly a father intended as a father on saving you rather than destroying you\nProduce has a new kind of personality with love for God combined with fear of God and fear of God combined with love of God with that kind of personality you can draw close to God as he has grown close to you\nYou're perfectly content to go along with God with faith and fear and lob producing a new maturity without really help the outlook on life that's what Martin Luther was talking about when he explained the ten commandments we should fear and love and trust in God above all things\nWe should fear and love God that we may tame our cursing and swearing and crabbing as sharp and filthy tons\nWe should fear and love God that we may offer him acceptable worship and praise we should fear and love God that we may honor respect love and obey every proper authority including parents'\nWishes fear and love God that we may stop murdering people not simply with guns and knives with loving and hateful words and deeds\nWish it fair love God that all of our thoughts words and actions may be sexually pure and clean we should fear and love God that we may not engage into grand larceny or slander whereby we Rob people if they're good names\nWe should fear of God that we may not craven covered what we can never\nOwn or possess we could live that way in fear of God and a lot for God we can do that by faith which is born at the foot of the cross of God son Jesus Christ\nThat's why we were not fear citizens we know God and we will not be given to the fear that destroys [noise]\nThere is a river the streams where a show make glad

deceive or you don't have to be perfect but you can be forgiven and you can be late in the right direction as watch Jake that the lord of house is with us the God of Jake God does our refuge\nAnd one of those people that I I'd probably do myself a harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can imagine like forty different horrible things that could happen um so

President Kennedy's promise\nThat puts Armstrong edits sadder rather than the events that we see everything from his perspective while observing him at the same time as he adores the physical cost of escaping earth's gravity\nOr as the machines he rides in ... in like a ship and star some may find the style and storytelling kind of suffocating the performance mechanical but I found that absorbing and stirring portrait of the personal cost of obsession and perfection first men open on friday\nYeah you know I didn't I didn't realize and still use until he started talking to me about this film you know on the personal side Neil Armstrong went through some challenges a leading up to his a famous space mission\nYeah and there were ... as did NASA which a separate deaths and uh they're they're portrayed him fill a and they affect the Armstrong you know I don't know ... portrait as but I'm assuming that he was kind of a closed up guy who just pretty much focused on the mission and that's how it's portrayed\nMore young and on the personal level a tragedy within his family\nYeah and they and it it's really one of the first scenes in the film we experience that and then one of the lessons or something as well it's a really well tied together\nOkay I'm excited about the old man and the gum and you had a great interview with director David Laurie tell me about him\nWhile the men and again it's a pretty witty and entertaining a multi shot tail it's ice film it's a romance character portrait added star driven of course Robert Redford plays a gentleman bank robber who charms of victims and the friends of widow played by ... it's set in the Nineteen eighties and it's kind of cut from the same clock\nAs film so in that era that maybe start Redford like staying in Butch Cassidy uh Danny Glover and Tom Waits play his partners in crime and Casey Affleck plays a haggard cop tracking them the director David Lowery doesn't really invent a profound as much as bring a spirited tone to it was quick scene but at the center brown\nAnd focusing on peripheral details on site the central action Redford has recently walked back his comments that he would be this wouldn't be as last film but if it is\nAs valedictorian work already has helped a right for ... a high note of course as we as we may or may not know already up as a as a Milwaukee area native born in\nAugust shy he moved out of here when it was about eight years old he still has family in the area as a kid he used to go back and forth and\nAnd visit without a and he goes in Milwaukee reference I in in the movie which is

I mean if you look at it obviously Miller Park obviously name for a meal of course where they had to actually handed out free beer as a result of the Rockies series and that was great for the brand and great for them but\nEven things like a war of putting some of the new babies and brewer outfits right after they were born and even at the stadium you're seeing them you know from God's controls to other team their names on national television they're getting a lot of buzz out of this I think it's good for the city but I also think it's really nice for the brand\nYeah butts illegal looser this quite a bit the fact that you know winning baseball or down through the years historically has said so just social impact on society and that does\nIt really has if you think about I mean I've covered the birds and watched the first few years\nI Can't remember such excitement over team you know I mean it's hard to remember back to ... to it and I'm sure there was but that he didn't have social media and all that stuff that's going on so it's good for city economically it's great to have a lot of LA fans in the town this week and spending money on national media but you're also seeing walking all over the national scene so that's great because of\nObviously wines are Brad and kind of wines are reaching all the people will come there this kind of thing wedding sports is great for city\nI've been following your coverage of the greater Milwaukee foundations on the table or upcoming events I'm fascinated by this I think in terms of public discourse this is a really a creative concept\nIt is I actually was at one earlier this week it was I couldn't hear of these ah I was at one where there was like probably like three hundred people they're split at tables\nAnd those eight or nine people at a table and you just talk and it talked about issues you talked about\nDiversity you talked about technology you talked about the kind of the millennials you talked about having and it was people that was neat for me was it was people that you don't normally see at about say where people from all the committee from all areas of community for all ages ethnicity and the whole work so it's a great\nWay and this awful leads to things I I Know last year that there was a lot of talk about having things happen outside of the downtown area and we're obviously seen some of that in terms of moving to neighborhoods but I just think it's good to get people around the table to talk\nYou know it's amazing even you know and and you cover this all the time business with his oftentimes they they do business over lunch there's something about sitting at a table and sharing food or a beverage that causes people to relax and to be forthcoming\nRight it does I think it's also having that dinner or having that meal in this case with somebody you don't normally talk to\nWith an individual from another era the community from another industry and just kind of having a discussion about kind of things you see kind of things that they see I see a lot of respect that these events like kind of for each other and for the other opinion something you don't feed on say a lot of nowadays I just think it's great for the city to have these because it brings up a lot of issues\nAnd really allows a lot of people who aren't always involved to get involved\nNow you took part in breaking of bread during one of the preliminary rounds but am I correct on October Seventeen years when the large gathering throughout the region is going to occur do I have a what\nThey already had one earlier this week and that was October seventh and more so that was kind of the ... the things that are also rolled up into larger events and larger issues sunny I think you'll see a lot of discussion about this over the last couple of months\nIn terms of public policy ultimately coming forth from is do you see this is slowly evolving something's just going to be ongoing\nYeah I see it happening every year it's been so successful and it's really I think it'd be more ... deemed\nAs a kind of evolving to envy you know people will talk about specific issues more so right now it's pretty broad yeah but I think it's just good to get people to get around the table and having a discussion kind of like the old failing deal you know we all grew up that way where you sat down with non bad day and they talked about how the day when we don't see that as much nearly anymore\nWhile they taught us how the whole this woman for a gripe third grade that number that OK northwest of mutual is new uh seven Seventy seven luxury apartment\nOr a initiative is really something to behold but in terms of larger you know downtown residential scheme of things sounds is going to fit in what's its place\nThis is on the up right there is no doubt this is a a probably probably one of the nicest building in the city\nYou know complete with that's with the thirty fifth overlooks downtown beautiful views has the pool exercise room\nEverything you want in terms of luxury remind myself a high end but it kind of rhymes with what I'm Glad you and I've talked about that this residential explosion that's happening in the city are seeing more and more people who are believed in the summers in the downtown area which is really good for say this is obviously on the high end\nBut you know we're seeing we talked about the one last week from New land where they wanted to build the Twenty one storey apartment building on the former Eduardo sites so more and more people want to live downtown want to spend their money they don't want to beat out down and that's great for the city\nYou know there's this movement and most urban attitude cross different generations or is it a lot of it retired successful people\nWhy they got in the end of the north west mutual it's more on the other end because you have to have a lot of money to live there there's no doubt about that but I think just overall scheme is kind of on both ends you have to millennials who love to live down town do you do not have a car to walked over to lift places but on the other hand you have people like me who have moved back\nDown town who whatnot back what what mood down town just because we want a new lifestyle we want to live near where we work we want to live there where we shop we want to walk places and it's just kind of I think it's neat to see that throughout the throughout the city of throughout this area you see a lot of age variants ... which I think is great\nScreenwriter filmmaker verse example John Ridley has not forgotten his mark your roots and as you well know 'cause you've been hitting hard on this story doing some pretty cool to pass brewery complex or talk about that a little bit\nWell you open the studio actually on friday and he's he's in town for it but it's really about the economics of the city bringing a focus right back to the city it's called no studios but it really is you know it's got a screening room it's going to have aren't related offense he's going to actually have some actual production there\nBut it's about economic impact you know over the years we've seen lives\nAnd very slowly growing film industry in this area we see the very successful film festival this is kinda next step to bring a guy like him who's been incredibly successful with his career\nTo bring some of his money and some of his focus back into the city he's working with Chris safely on this project I think it's just neat because one of one and the area it said the two because it really shows off the city and shows up at a uh an industry that's not that well known\nOkay Mark Hasse editor in chief Milwaukee Business Journal always re checking in with mark he's got a
