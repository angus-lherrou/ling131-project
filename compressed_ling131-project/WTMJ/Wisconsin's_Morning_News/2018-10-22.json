C. S.\nUh that that was a long season of not always having the consistent off and said he was the moves that they may they may move they they went all in with the fence\nOr when they decided to move Travis shot a second and bringing my stock is and some other moves and there were still periods of time where all of a sudden they just had a really hard time scoring runs so if there's one thing to look at that's probably that's probably it you\nThink there'd be a change in the emphasis mad because it seems like this is a team that didn't play small ball a wasn't really good at bouncing are moving runners advancing runners was very concerned about launching very comfortable striking out so if you if you're not any home runs it seemed Milwaukee Brewers were offensively challenged\nYeah I I don't I wouldn't say uh you know a change of approach I Would say you like them to\nBe a little bit more sound in terms of situational headache you know being able to move the runner over I'm not talking about putting down\nA bond every time he got to run around and second and nobody out seeking a sacrifice flies score one run that's never going to be what this team isn't quite honestly it's not what the ... teams should be because they are going to they're going to score a lot more runs swinging away with a runner on a second and nobody out\nThan they are ... do not run or over but\nThere are situations where you know I got to do is change that approach a little bit and make sure the very least are hitting the ball and the right side of the field so you can move around her on so I Would not say it's gonna be a change of approach I mean this team just got to game seven of the you know see as soon as one of the last three teams playing I don't think there's any reason for there to be an approach change but as\nAs the evolution of this this current group in this era brewers baseball continues to move forward they they certainly can get better and some of the situational areas\nLooking into your crystal ball as best as you can in your best estimation opening day twenty Nineteen who's the brewers third baseman and who is the brewers second baseman\nOh man that is tough I it really comes down to do they tried to bring up my stock is back and I think there are Fifteen million dollars or so is that mutual option mutual opposite they're almost never picked up because I always one side doesn't want to do it\nBut I thought it was ... was a really good fit on this team and if there's a way to bring him back especially if you move on from Johnson scope\nAnd keep them in stock is around ... that would to me that makes a lot of sense but that's just a just as easily as that happened and maybe even more likely\nYou see Travis shot back at third and it's back to the age old question of who's going to play second base for the brewers and the the thing there is has to here is knocking on the door and he's going to be a really good second baseman and the big leagues now listed teams ... coming up we'll be one game short of going to the world series you're not going to\nGive second base to a rookie going into next year plus he's not going to be ready to start the season you're not just going to have a place fill are there so you have to have a legit option\nI I liked the idea of bringing new stock is back having Travis shot seconds and wants testing here is ready you figure out that issue at the time and and baseball things always work out so I'm not making a production I've\nJust say I'm just kind of laying out the scenario because you do have to remember a in the next year test here is going to be making the brewers debut in all likelihood were live with\nBrewers extra innings was mad polio WGM gee starting pitching machine at the start of this year to be the birds efficiency could be a strong point from twenty Nineteen look who's gotten Big Jim emails and a couple of other guys who you could stretch out and putting that rotation\nOh yeah absolutely I mean with the veteran guys got Nelson coming back but you have your least shot scene I just have to believe that weight Mali is going to be back\nUh it just makes way too much sense after what he was able to accomplish what the brewers and how he had a career renaissance of them from a you stay on poison corporate burns is going to be in the rotation pretty ... says another guy who you are they going to get an opportunity to be there look at what brand new wonder if it's done recently I think they're going to have to make the decision\nDo you put him into the starting rotation or do you say he can kind of be a right handed version of Josh hater out of the bullpen and leave him there there's going to be a ton of options and I would expect that\nUh there's there's gotta be guys out there whether it's free agency or whether it's trades that make sense are already seen people clamoring for sunny great to be acquired because the Yankees are almost absolutely going to train him there's there's other names of Nathan involved they are a joke Kelly names like that\nThat seemed to kind of makes sense so I Do think starting pitching this going to be a strength of

missing and answers in a premium joining us led the way this is the b._b._c. news correspondent Brian ... morning right\nGood morning yeah here's the latest what we have as far as the search goes one week later we know that twelve hundred tips that come into the Baron county sheriff's department as they continue to try to look for Jamie ... some kind of evidence any kind of information that late may lead them to her uh they've already responded to about a thousand of those tips so they continue to I\nAsked for more ask for the public help anyone who may have seen something out of the ordinary may have spotted Jamie to give them a call ... we also learned over the weekend uh that uh the nine one one call that was placed a that alerted police chewed a home\nWhere those bodies were discovered was placed on the phone of Chinese mother Denise\nI'm there was no response when nine one one dispatchers picked up the phone but they did hear a lot of commotion and chaos and yelling going on in the background when police arrived at the scene about four minutes after that nine one one call was placed a before discovering the bodies they get noticed the front door kicked in so\nPerhaps I'd other reason as to why it is that they are including at this point the Jamie was taken by someone who was armed at the time it no gun was found at the scene so um this is the assumption they're operating under is that she's out there somewhere and that there is a gunman who took her\nMind working from that assumption that when I think back to the case of Elizabeth Smart you know you think how can you stay hidden all that time it can be done\nIt can and I actually it was talking with er with Brad Garrett or FBI and and crime analyst with ABC about this uh you know how is it that you know it it is it possible that she's far away in California or Florida or a you know somewhere outside\nOf Wisconsin He says you know it's probably going to be something in Wisconsin nearby that's going to eventually lead police\nOr to conclude this investigation so I it it may be something you know that maybe she wasn't taking very far away\nUm that's one of the reasons that uh we saw hundred volunteers on Thursday scouring an area about three miles from the whole we don't exactly know what it was that\nA wet police to that area whether it was a tip whether it was a some kind of cell phone paying or maybe some kind of canine activity we just don't know at this point but are they scour that area and to our understanding didn't come across anything significant\nRelied with ABC's Ryan borough talking about the disappearance of dreamy closed in the murder periods and authorities from the get go seem to see that the folks in beer in that vicinity don't need to worry that this doesn't appear to be a a a serial killer or something random so then that would only do\nWhatever it was the the trigger this incident whatever that may be the Saudis won't talk about that\nA patch or potentially a targeted attack yeah or they're keeping a lot of information very close it's frustrating it's frustrating for the public gets frustrating for ah the media because we're not getting a ton of information about what they know or whatever it even took them like thirty six forty eight hours to tell us that the parents\nA bird even took them like thirty six forty eight hours to tell us your parents were shot to death which seemed to ah you know to be a necessary but um they they want to keep this information as close as possible because they don't want to keep any one off\nOr perhaps they do have a bead on someone and they're following cell phone records or perhaps\nA they why they're they're monitoring someone's activities and and they don't want you alert them so I that's one of the reasons that being said that they need to continue to keep the story front and center so they will be having a press conference around four o'clock this afternoon or there will also be a gathering of hope for Jamie cloth\nAt her school later this evening so either try to keep it obviously front and center of the other hand they're not giving away a lot of information\nABC's ... joining us lead
