Rendell the brewers radio network and joins us live on WGM drinking morning or\nGood morning it's good to be with you guys a what a what a wonderful day for the brewers yesterday\nSo another day another champagne shower and a lot of room away from home is it getting old\nAnd we we were actually talking about that in in the clubhouse when the celebration of starting to wind down a little bit that want it never gets old uh being able to celebrate like that\nOr to see guys that you watched grind through the season day in and day out and and to see them accomplish what they've become I mean it just it it's a really\nSatisfying feeling to see those guys get to celebrate in that fashion so that part never gets old\nBut it's funny all three of these celebrations have been on somebody else's turf\nAnd now hopefully the brewers can find a way to to get one at home um you know there's a chance to maybe the the strength to continue at the same time but um it would be fun to be able to celebrate one of these Miller Park because uh the the brewer fans obviously deserved it to have a lot of these where they could celebrated at home too\nI understand there are quite a few fans now even in a Colorado they've got to come down to the ... come down to the field after the game\nYou can always tell at least over the last two months you can always tell how many fans are in a visiting venue for the brewers when Mike ... because you can hear the moose call\nSo to speak and it was loud yesterday I'm a you know the brewers never really let the Rockies fan to get into that game and and I and that was a big deal because it fifty plus fifty thousand plus fans are at Coors Field and even on a two strikes on a brewers hitter it would start to get louder than the rock\nAnd had a base runners start to get loud but the brewers would would kind of shut them up again and I think that if the Rockies were ever able to get a little momentum going they might have been able to write that crowd that the brewers just never let them\nGet that done but there were a lot of brewers fan so when you walked around low do that the downtown area around who are ... you saw a lot of ... year and that you could hear him in the in the stadium yesterday too like I said on my stocks to play the ... very loud\nI don't want to be the one who brings a room down but just for a second here the brewers have been so hot and they want to eleven straight games they had to play the extra game a week ago today the Monday game at Wrigley Field than they had just two days before ... beginning the LDS now they've got four days off how much of a danger\nOr do you think there is that that four days off could cool them off and how do you prevent against that\nDoug this is the U.S have to set trombone\n[laughter] well I\nI just I'm trying to not let this happen but I'm I'm I'm John and\nSaying I Know what you're saying and I think it's probably cross most people's minds listening so hot maybe if they are All right let's get back on this thing going you know I like in this run a lot to the twenty four to Kansas City royals um\nThat was a team that got hot late they actually ended up being a wildcard teams for a little different in that regard but they won that wild cargo BAs then they swept the angels and the LBS then they swept the Orioles and the er at and the ... ale cs\nAnd then of course what seven games with the giants in the world series but um and then they went back and Fifteen and they won the world series this team has a lot of the same feel to it mainly because there's some of those players on his team at and Lawrence of and buy stock is air crafts you know you're playing the co seasons on that for two teams [noise]\nUm but also it was kind of the way they were winning\nBut they just got hot and it it it it became this thing where no matter what was going on in the game you felt like they were going to find a way to win and that can have some long way off a fortune team on their way to getting to the world series um but it never really\nAnd never really slow them down they would just pick things right back up and keep doing what they were doing the brewers have a great recipe and I think anybody I Know I certainly felt like if this thing could get into the post season they were going to be a really challenging group to handle because of the bullpen\nAnd because of the manager of you know how to ... to crate counseled as rocket enough credit for what he's done both culture wise but also how he addresses the buttons\nWith this group and and and find ways to piece together the twenty seven out so I think that's been on display in this series and a big way and I think people that maybe has been has two two she'll be tipping they're kept him now because you can see\nJust how ... years at that aspect of managing the game but\nUm I I took to me I I've always felt this team is going to be a really tough out uh in the playoffs because of the dominant open because of a really good top the order\nBecause of an elite defense and those are things that that play really really well in the post season and I think a layoff sure I mean we all kind of I think have those types of thought from the back for a minute but I I don't think it's going to change those things\nAre in a big way and in some ways it's going to get that ... and more rest it's going to allow the brewers to set up the rotation maybe a little bit better at it and I'll see us and so I think it's really a good thing and the brewers are going to embrace
