I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with raspberry trial I worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist and my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from Tim recruit and was there a troll from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from in a very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and or considered super feeds the green tea humid there was very ... why do you want to combine just read there's always a method to your\nYour madness if I could see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other works better you caught a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose\nOut of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidants\nSo they actually ... pardon the aging process of the cells\nIn our bodies and protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press\nEach one issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti ... activity and have lunch to sign on to recap some of these headlines in ... while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing\nPlasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume they don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among\nThe most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration\nOf antioxidants substances which are protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glued a sigh on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compounds called glue to science\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called\nGlue to fly on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplementing gradients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on you as we read reviews are all found in the new green tea combo formula review offering free bought him a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it\nBut scientists and researchers knows when the most powerful she proceeds on the planet\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea\nHelps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar\nAnd unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increase the weight so by stabilizing\nBlood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract when you've got the right extract but the science is there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see this with charities formula provides you with about three cups worth greedy in each to Capitol serving these cutting edge liquid soft joke so you know green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for ... in just too soft gel caps\nPlush you get to Kirk human and there was very close to so it's easy you call it your daily short cut to better health explained this idea of a healthy short time and explain some of the top benefits as well\nWell I mean you could for example drink three cops are good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor recruit and drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of\nThree of the biggest superstar protective health enhancing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that you can get in a capsule\nAnd a good liquid soft gelatin capsule or otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine hundred now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to yeah I Know this is one of your favorite readings for joint comfort and even for brain yeah\nWell I especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact blood studies show\nThe newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants\nIn their blood at that time a birth so we need a functioning super\nHealthy very strong liver we might not think about our livers that much but we need that ... and we know that Kirk and protect the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels and from a joint standpoint we have in New ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief and stable inflammatory activity\nBetter joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk human I like the brain protective\nStudies says well you know I think everybody wants a sharper\nClearer mind and Kirk human delivers all this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware path that most people are not going to eat\nEnough rock ... wrote to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated Kirk human extract\n[noise] I don't want to remind people didn't call now to get started with the free bottle of green tea see our dirty products this is their unique green tea formula secret human and the ... you ... today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now operators are standing by one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five right back to the show Chris I don't want to get to technical here but these ... oxygen green tea or classified as ... females and there really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists\nBut in his green T. C. R. formula there's more green tea ... human the ... we talked about\nFlash grape seed extract behind bars bio five annoyed vitamin C can you talk to me about this a re a really super anti accidents in ...\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract in pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue\nIn the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the current imminent resveratrol the bio flab annoyed\nAnd hence the overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nWe put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realize that we would have an utterly superior formula and just to reiterate pat I Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great\nThis formula the green tea the our will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nNot Christian I Love this green T. C. R. combination formula and remembers the C R stands for human interest reversal loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners she gets sorted for free that's great value what when people expect to pay if they bought all of these separately in the store well\nI think if they bought high quality products that contain the thin gradients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or

wouldn't get the pine bark extract the ... of the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results can people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking swimming\nI think that people

body\nBefore we get into that Dr Janet I'm a I'm going to ask you and I know this is hard for you because this is this is emotional but I think it's important for people to understand how you got to where you are today or why what what's driving by you and if you could share the story of\nSure well it was first that a lot of personal pain and pain out that my husband had years ago he had a severe osteoarthritis throughout his body at the same time I have fibromyalgia right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural\nTo help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\nMhm well let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that any oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain okay I took any oil\nAnd glucose me mhm I use ... which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay we're on the line that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory than natural organic sulfur that is also just as important as glucose inane and rebuilding repairing our joints\nAnd salad I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has no odor it's Greece list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain it doesn't irritate you scan\nDoes in Fifteen minutes later you have for ...\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and show and a half right has it right\nThen I I

... that sanitary you know ... so you have to worry about it becoming a rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body than um you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also they don't read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply that claimed to that area that you're that targets ... okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body feels itself provided you get the raw materials that needs and giving you what you made for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that seal okay\nAnd this is safe is nothing that you have to worry about if you have\nTo worry about the thing that you're taking a drug for pain it wrong conflict with that at all none of these ...\nGoing to have it okay so what what is then a a realistic expectation if somebody calls today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell them\nI Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you know then I noticed that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminated okay and then over time you're going to rebuild and repair your joints that inflammation being taken down\nThat's going to restore flexibility and mobility and sleep I mean if you can sleep again that's for our bodies get all of our recoup protests regenerative ability to heal and then with that being taken care of all the things that you love to do you can start doing again\nTraveling exercising so you can lose weight runny socialize with family and friends you can be the life of the party\nYeah pain really changes who you are because of all these are the things you your your right hand do are very difficult to deal with in terms of of living a normal life for trying to live\nWell you can't you're right you're right live a normal life in your life has changed forever and get this thing taking care of and you can yeah and\nYou've got people out there that are that are already getting great results\nBrought some more emails and letters he'd like to hear you okay um let's see Chris yes I'm from ... from California\nI Would love for you to know how happy I Am with your product my feet and like they usually and pain from being overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas unable to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nHere's one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a miracle in a tube that truly does take away the pain and works as nothing else I've ever tried to work quickly and lemonade all of the pain\nIs out to me now these are these\nYou do these kinds of responses unusual\nNo really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart\nTo hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails are these letters that just confirms that hundreds of thousands of people have used like great results that's\nGreat I also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call give that to you know\nIt's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\nAs we've been talking about here Dr Janet's formula is a fast acting glucose ... cream that provides relief on contact for those nagging aches and pains in your joints your neck your back your shoulders maybe your wrists are hands and knees basically anywhere that hurts\nAnd the best part is it's older loose if Greece loose and it won't stained so you can use this every day even on to your best clothes\nThe number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven nine seven zero nine and just see you know Dr Jana hasn't raised a very special offers only available to listeners so when you call me sure to mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of Dr Janet extra strength glucose swimming pain relief cream\nAgain this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\nPlus if you call the next ten minutes you'll also receive an extra free supply\nAnd so folks this was a really great offer again that number to call

hundred\nFor six seven nine seven zero nine or give it to you again it's\nOne eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\n[noise] so where do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that\nPerhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there but looking at it from a natural standpoint and Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again but when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and those how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue the half the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr Jana ... cream and this is this is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and this is good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme it is how minimal it is it's going to get him with me\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer and take your pain from like ... to a five and ... on the line with continue use mhm I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand what it was a very unique this was a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Janet\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried all of right things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't\nWork first of all the little cousin Marine Corps and ask them for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact I'm going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the light of some here taking it or early ... months people gave up\nPeople in pain they weren't really saying why now right and that I had developed this cream again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you

nation's\nSlippery amazing story isn't it I'm surprised at Hollywood hasn't made a movie of it yes\nWhat does it have to do with us though does it have anything to say to our time our day it does\nMe and my as the last of the history books in the Old Testament so we must remember this is another chapter of God's redemptive history that began back in genesis three\nWhen God said that he would crush the head of the serpent and in genesis twelve that he would make gave her hands descendants of blessing to the nations of the world\nThis was another chapter this was a time when God's people were disgraced in on the ropes and people wonder what God's Plan lay waste had deserted them to make it on their own was this beyond his help and the good news is God did not desert them he sent someone\nA cup of that came to put things back together again so that his great redemptive plans couldn't move on\nGod is faithful to his people we see it in this story today as I said this was a chapter in a much bigger story or restoration project in the midst of a much bigger restoration project restoration of the world\nAbout four hundred years later a new ... there will entered the scene\nIs restored

higher and he was tempted to give up buddy didn't\nI'm doing a great work and I cannot come down just like me and my aunt and God raised him from the grave affirming the new covenant in his blood\nAnd the story moves on this God's continues his restoration through the church\nYou and me bringing others into his kingdom slowly but surely moving us towards that new Jerusalem that new heaven and earth at the end creation totally restored\nGod's work finally completed and that my friends is one of the great reasons to pray God's faithfulness\nThis story is not so much about Nina mine's leadership and power but we do learn some important things to his experiences it's more about God faithfulness and grace that he has given us is valuable tool called prayer and he answers prayer\nThis is a prayer and hard work story not just\nThe prayer at the beginning of his memoirs but all the way through the project he's praying praying for help praying for strength praying for protection St remember oh lord\nHe accomplishes great things this God through obedient servant who answers called to serve and to pray for this story is for his workers meaning if you're in Christ you and me\nAre God is on changing that same grace and strength is available to you and me as God's workers in\nHis field as a church and mission he still has an unchanging planned to restore his whole creation to bless all of the nation suicide in Jesus\nAnd we're the call people empowered by a spirit to serve out his purposes and bringing people to that kingdom so our take away from this near my story\nAs missionaries as servants of God working for the Lord Jesus Christ to bring people into his kingdom is simply this prefers and work hard\nThing happens with this combination in this order prayer hard work and God's faithfulness dot that wall built didn't\nCheeses operated the same way in this day to day ministry and even before the trial the cross there was prayer in the garden of ... and you might say yeah but that wasn't near my as time and the timing cheeses can those things actually happened today let me tell you a story\nIn two thousand ten a group of eight people from two churches felt called the Detroit boulevard neighborhood of Sacramento, California\nIt was known as one of the most notorious crime written neighborhoods in all the Sacramento each house in that neighborhood was a place of danger nonetheless this group of eight decided to walk through the neighborhood praying over each home praying for the presence of Christ or rain over violence addiction and ...\nThe panic oppression they began walking through the neighborhood praying overreach home and review the demonic strongholds of addiction and violence one of the eight former Sacramento police officer in gang detective Michael Jong reported that each time we prayed over the houses we felt the weight of oppression becoming lighter\nA woman from one of the house was confronted that once you discovered they're praying for the community she asked for healing and God healed or\nThe group soon physically moved into the neighborhood and started what they called Detroit life church a couple of years later a local newspaper the Sacramento Bee reported that there were no homicides robberies or sex crimes\nAnd only one assault and Detroit boulevard between two thousand Thirteen and two thousand fourteen\nDetroit boulevard has been transformed by a small group of people who began their ministry in the neighborhood by crane around houses streets in parks\nFor the power of St Louis vanquished\nKingdom prayer in body is what it means to be physically present to his presence in this world listened near my favorite is issue when things but overwhelming\nProblems at odds with the kneeling position and then he got up and worked hard made that be said of us as individuals and as the church of Jesus Christ amen [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nWe ma\nAnd\nYou\nKnow\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nWhat'd you pray with me lord thank you for the privilege of prayer\nMay be our first thing to do instead of our last resort as we face the situations in our lives\nWe praise you for this story today reminding us that you do answer prayer and that you are faithful to your people in the name of Jesus we pray a man\nNow is you go on your way may Christ go with you man he'd go before you to show either way behind you to encourage you beside you to befriend you above you to watch over and within you to give us peace amen\nYou've been worshipping with the Internet and radio ministry of the Christian crusaders we prayed today's story of me and my I Will inspire you to first take your chairs to God in prayer then get off your knees and get to work in God's kingdom\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value than those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nHinder gospel of John we recall the account of where Jesus healed blind beggar in their travels de Jesus and that disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him rabbi\nWho send this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man's sand or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient\nNot worthy of having right now has this new life\nIs it in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves throughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year the arguments for abortion ranged from not wanting to raise children with birth defects\nTo those concede due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lives as we are we may no longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting\nSin has caused us to become towel a sub seeing life as having great value from the one who gives a dead as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWould good could\nBring a disabled child into this world possibly brain what purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\nEven though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away\nIt isn't really a life until it solely enters the world we hear today and until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock is a time looking at strangers seeing how they are dresser are thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less\nThan our own but what if we are wrong what if\nOur sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once\nCreated in his image oh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold self value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness\nYou see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnant of it\nAnd God loves that so much that he wants that all would be saved\nAnd if his value for all of us just so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not and as Christians\nWe cannot be complacent about this issue\nWe cannot claim to see God by his words to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives\nYeah using evil for good as God does all lives have purpose we may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is\nYou see God it's a servant king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is\nAnd how valued his creation is to be seen thinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow yet wanting none of that God and knowing how we\nCould never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded of life for our dead ones ones that deserves nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nJust see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are\nGod still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him\nAll lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own defects maybe then we can see how his loved extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and\nDeserve to know of his love also those who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist\nAs lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nDOJ grants to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive loved in return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with their trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be him closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understanding of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening\nAnd do you have gone against that which God wish for you to have\nTaking of life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain I\nEncourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil wants you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the sooner the last the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age\nAnd in that there is much to be thankful for the life giver our lord and savior seats to give us life eternal in him she wants to share of his love\nThat you would share his love with others also I mean we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purposes God declares us to be for behold children our heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMaybe we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them\nBut there was nothing greater to be thankful for today man a father who spared not even the life of his son to save ours and trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life\nThat never ends me that\nPiece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior Jesus Christ in his name we pray\nAll men\nTo learn how you can support worldwide outreach of loose on our ministries go too loose run our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's why I made five five five six for six three one six\nOh God
