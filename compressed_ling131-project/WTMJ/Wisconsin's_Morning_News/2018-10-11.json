Packers head coach Mike mccarthy is Green Bay gets ready to take on the forty\nNiners the Monday Night game is is the only Monday Night game on the back of your schedule\nI Believe it is they've got a Monday Night game in a Thursday night came they've already playing a Sunday night games on the way the NFL schedule is kind of spread out over the years remember when you get them to the maximum three Monday Night football games that was the sign that you were one of those marquee teams will now it's just kind of spread out no\nNo and then they're trying to make Thursday nights little six year\nWell the massive sort of very good of the matchups been great um but it it's still it's such a tough week on the players I mean the the turning burn is that's tough on the body\nThey loved the routine to be like a regular things that regular times in days off when they're supposed to have days off and so forth anyway Packers forty niners that can be happening Monday Night at seven Fifteen kick off you can be there's we follow the Packers presented by what's been the silver lining will take a fresh qualifier at seven eleven this morning one more to my own and out of those five that we choose each and every day\nWill choose one that lucky duck will get to go to ... to see the Packers take on the niners and get off this night of two two and one the Packers are not hitting an all lead admittedly especially in office\nNow if you look at the penalties and that's one of the things that uh if we do get a chance to talk to the coach how do you clean it up during the week because that's the one commonality and the two losses that they've had they had twelve penalties for a hundred twelve yards this past week when they shut up buffalo five penalties or six yards which is certainly manageable\nBut the week prior to that double digit penalties triple digit yards in their last against Washington that seems to be the commonality\nAnd it's the un force there's the ... the taunting penalty last week against Detroit you didn't have to be a liberator to see what like a because he was saying to that\nKid is he was coming off the field after you get flagged for that um it was it was that the king's English but if I can say that you know what were you thinking what do you do when you get a stop and you do something like that in a gated deficiencies in the field and\nBad things just got worse speaking of that routine I just had my life will go off I'm Wondering if the coach is on a Monday Night routine and he's thinking maybe we're calling\nTomorrow ... we have um right now what we do yep racial just found him hey coach I doing wrong with\n[laughter] or will show last [laughter]\nIt was a break [laughter] we didn't sneak up on it did we\nKnow no I was in the office bookstore were the words are often says as you can imagine\nOh okay yeah I work never stuff well let's talk about what's going on with the team I'm One of the issues I Would imagine besides red zone finding some balance and rhythm and often she had a ton of yards against Detroit and the laws but probably not as many points obviously is due to like you've seen on the scoreboard again\nYeah definitely I think you know anytime you want to move the wife or the fill them up with that we did a very good job of them are just didn't\nElect cheer her opportunities and the roads also you know just like anything we put one from a little more time than normally going back through the mature worker and the drugs that they don't learn but they were going to come away with the porch\nWith ... with a you know it's a tough game to swallow especially rare division game on the road those are those that are clearly my view the horrors games when a division games on the road and well we only have opportunity we felt going for us\nYou know and I were just talking about penalty is last week twelve hundred twelve yards you win against buffalo the week prior to that manageable five penalties for six yards week three again double digit penalties for triple digit yards in your loss of Washington is there a formula during the week during practice that you can get those things cleaned up on Sunday or in this case Monday\n[noise] well it really was saying is is a segment that article for both of which are just so scarred with all of those main main topics random today will be the first Persian with the with the force of power so\nWe're breaking down through code words you can buy the penalties are near the supplemental as you go for each and every one of them and you know the bigger so at the discipline that was just no excuse for him so much the only reason\nThose types of things so we need to rip those for more performers to keep working uh keep working on the techniques and it just cleaned that up to the tobacco was growing up also\nIn briefly before we let you go yeah mission Crosby at a rough day on Sunday but the body of work you said I was watching TV show last night or

Milwaukee forty one a double duty and Jay\nThis young man is considerable portion of his life involved with your Milwaukee Brewers versus a player now is an analyst for Fox Sports Wisconsin jury August dean joins us on WGM Jake morning or good morning gene how you doing today for\nDoing terrific group played baseball in October argues or anything better than that\nIt is awesome I just the way this ball club has gone on that at all you're\nJust make that much better and now they're playing such great falling you look at what they have to do from the beginning of August ... start winning series they did that and uh you know I like what they've done in the way they've done it ... that an unusual at times like they've been very very\nI mean what challenges are they going to face going up against the Dodgers\nPitching I think ah when you look at the Dodgers I think they are real balance walk there are very good cook and it took to manage my childhood\nThat ... that makes a that makes a big a better thing\nBut uh I think they're a well balanced team uh I think we're going to see a lotta left him that you and I think we have therefore ... that we will see will be a left and so as a lot of left out of it you know like we did during the year at times but they're just a good balance ball club and we're going to have to come play out that's baseball\nWe can ask David Stern is when we talk to him in an hour what roster tweet she might make but he's not going to tell us a because the rosters do until ... am tomorrow morning but kind of looking into your Augie crystal ball what squeaks you'd think they might make from the divisional series to the championship series going from a five game series to seven games\nWell first of all I think they're going to need it they're going to the bullpen is going to change that I think they're going to have to have a left hander products that Daniel probably be activated either of those two guys for sure\nOr they may change around it probably another starting pitcher I don't know if it reaches Patterson or is that a bees but they're going to need another starting pitcher because you're going to go seven games and the extra started ... and the whole way through I don't think\nSo I think they're going to have to add another star so\nI think that for you to go see the big thing to be interesting to see who they do keep a a you know the the Dodgers have a real good at all so that they're that left handed starting rotation that they're going to happen to have her Shaw is it there ... going to be there really is going to be there\nYou know do you see those guys for sure a lot of uh so I think you're going to see some more of a right not giving them\nA that they're going to have off the bench\nWe're live with former

the most coveted players during the\nDay before the trade deadline he winds up with the Dodgers does this first daily news conference at Miller Park places first game is a Dodger your uh do you think the brewers are better off without him\nI you know he's a great player I think you anytime you get a higher caliber he's going to help you there's no doubt that that it brings a lot of all of a shortage of power is just a good all around player\nYou know he's a kind of kind of guy that already do you look at the Dodgers or you get to that yeah that that that that RBI slot in their line up so I Would have been better within yes where are we have we got about what we've done very well we've had guy stepped up and\nUh I think this is a well rounded all of that belief in themselves\nAnd they go do it they have to do in a I think he look past that now and now it's just a matter of going out playing good solid baseball and it could beat the Dodgers can they do it if I I think that can do it because I think the way they go play each and every day\nNumber one that looked at their effects they haven't proved that Leon defense all year long they're coming up with big gets off that leader
