correspondent Stephanie Ramos morning Stephanie hey good morning no real surprise is I guess yesterday was out of the president in most of the other than\nA little bit of a situation that we talked about the explosive devices and the need to be United then pivots and says the media is to blame\nYou got it that's exactly what happened to president last night\nStarted this campaign rally a little differently called for all sides to quote come together and peace and harmony\nHe did not specifically mention Hillary Clinton representative Maxine Waters CNN the Obamas or any of the others targeted yesterday and those are the names who are routinely mentioned in his speeches at these campaign style rallies\nNow as he said the president even though taking this civility and unifying tone I'm Still blame the media and also ... tweeted about the media this morning saying that again blaming the meeting this morning saying that I'm at\nThe very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false that an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news so\nIt continues today as police investigate and a pipe bomb or suspected pipe bomb that was delivered to the offices of Robert Deniro who has also been a critic of the presidents\nHave any I Wonder if the mood was maybe a little bit less rock is at the rally last night because as you said without mentioning some of those big key points that he likes to slam and his rallies it seems like it might have been missing a little something\n[noise] All right I mean there were still he's still kind of jokes about his his own change in tone saying see how I'm behaving we're all behaving very well which\nAre the supporters and and the crowd there I enjoy uh but uh yeah you ... your clue right he didn't mention at his usual um\nThose by name but we'll have to wait and see if if this continues he he even said last night and even though there he's behaving we're going he said we're going to keep it that way so we'll just have to wait until the next rally because he's rally will continue right up until the mid term election\nWere led with ABC News correspondent Stephanie Ramos there was the report late yesterday afternoon about President Trump ignoring the advice of security officials in continuing to using an secured cell phone in part because clearly doesn't want to change contacts or or do any of the other things that you have to do when you use a government secured phone his he said anything about that yet\nHe has he tweeted about that an hour ago he said that to the so called experts over at the New York times another on media outlet that he's often criticize\nUs he says that they wrote this this article about his cell phone usage if he's just saying that that that that it's wrong but it's incorrect so\nI Will just have to see what else what other reporting comes out of that is what other proof and document or anything like that but at this point the president is tweeting that that is just not right if this is accurate Stephanie that would really be quite something oh it would especially\nI mean all of what we heard about Hillary Clinton and her her email server and and and that's actually a topic that the president continues to talk about this this will be huge and it would be um\nA just a very hypocritical if it's actually if it's accurate\nData kick outta that times story is that he's been told that the Russians and perhaps even when that the Russians because they figure he's in okay with\nBlood and reporting to the point where the Russians don't need to monitor is private phone calls but the Chinese they say these security experts say are probably listening in on his phone conversations on this insecure device we'll
