until the end of October ... we will it would burst and they have the benefit of the long ball yesterday but they they still had enough to when they just peace left together enough offense against a very tough a tough starter\nThey did you know they they use sacrifice bonding with shot scene they just they found a way yesterday it was one of those find a way games\nAnd uh they get the early run and they're able to push across those two runs in the eighth inning I mean Orlando Garcia going for for giving me a break it seems appropriate that Ryan Braun with driving around with the importance of yesterday's game Christian ... once again could not be put out so they they found a way yesterday to get that one\nMan who would you prefer to see them take on in the next in the next step is should it be the cubs again do they have enough to take them on again or would you prefer to see the Rockies\nI think they got better chance it gets the Rockies I think the cubs are a little bit of a better team against the Rockies the other side of that is Kyle three lenders are pitching today for the Rockies and he is clearly their best pitcher\nSo the fact that he's going to de means the brewers would not see him until a game at number three so all things being equal I think they have a better shot against the Rockies and the cubs but I think they've got a pretty good shot inside of those teams\nNow that the rosters men have to go back to twenty five you don't have this expanded uh September roster any longer you don't have fourteen guys in the bullpen anymore in your opinion how much difference do you think the game will be managed by crank council because of that\nIt will be different but I don't think it's going to be all the way back to what we saw it may June July August because you still have a bunch of off taste so you're allowed to manage the game a little bit differently because of all those arms in the bullpen and all the guys on the bench during the month of September now you get into the postseason\nAnd while you don't have all those guys you don't have to be quite as careful with the bullpen because you know you've got a more off days coming so yeah it's going to be different there's obviously going to be some times or maybe a starting pitchers asked to go a little bit longer but I don't think it's going to be exactly the way it was earlier on in the season\nWe're allied with Bruce extra innings host Mitt polio WGM juice or what do we figure three men rotation for me run up\nThat's what I was up for the for the divisional series yes I think

back to four man rotation but absolutely for the divisional series with the off days I generally scheduled after I games or to an after games for\nI think you can definitely go into that and it just take three starting pitcher so how was the bar yesterday\nIt was fun man it was it was a it was a good time you know a lot of people after the game got overlap brewers fans ah walked over from Wrigley Field and really enjoy themselves there were still a fair amount of cubs fans who were there and it was it was more interesting to see the reaction to the cubs fans because it was just\nIt was almost like they were expecting what happened yesterday to just to happen they were uh they don't have a lot of confidence in their team right now and I don't think they were real happy about\nPlaying that game and the first place so it was it was a dual dynamic it was cool to see all the brewers fans as happy as they were but it was also really interesting to see the way the cubs fans are reacting\nIt'd be interesting to see what the cubs have left in the tank tonight after losing that game yesterday and they're tired their dog tired they haven't had what they had what maybe one day up in the last forty\nI think it's thirty nine and forty yeah that's it that's incredible and you know they didn't sell out yesterday's game and ten thousand of those people were or brewers fans are they going to sell out today's game where they aren't well I don't think a lot of people are on that flight from Denver to Chicago today to go check out that game so what the crowd looks like it

game one sixty three and a the Chicago media at least one column is being very gracious to the brewers David is it ...\nH H A U G H\nOf the Tribune says Milwaukee's Best was too good for the cubs the better team or in the division title regardless of any lazy local narrative that suggests otherwise the brewers won the division more than the cubs last it\nGoing Nineteen Seventy in September ... hot on the first day of October the cubs did what they could by winning for their final five series with the regular season when sixteen and twelve during the final month but it wasn't enough to keep the brewers from overcoming a five game deficit at Labor Day think about that they were fighting back and Labor Day yeah man\nCubs vantage three measly it's against the brewers wonderful under twenty nine foot home run to Anthony result if the cubs bass remain in storage Tuesday night in the wild card game suddenly thrust on Wrigley bill he writes than the off season will start Wednesday\nIn the playoffs the cubs could see the same brewers ... been the shut them down as early as Thursday by then we used to lift the Josh eight or should be arrested along with every other brewer's reliever starting pitchers will carry the cubs will be so far at some point he says the hitters most reconnect restore confidence in this deem\nWere not did in the water manager Joe ... some signs of life by hubs hitters he writes would make that more believable so yeah but you felt that we as like the steam to go toe to toe with the cubs\nWithout a doubt um they say that the last piece of any championship puzzle in baseball is mental really than when I say middle relief I mean that's it's become early to to middle really for the brewers\nAnd that really is the last piece of a championship team because if you got everything else some place you need a lockdown games and make them shorter and if the brewers have a lead after six innings you feel really good about their chances in starting pitching has been better than I think a lot of people thought it might be\nUm the only thing that I Would quibble with um a data off their homes yeah we'll call them we'll go with that will go with that um is that they won't necessarily facing the same brewers bullpen because the rosters now shrink to twenty five as opposed to\nYou know the fourteen relievers that Craig council had at his disposal throughout the month of September the other thing is the cubs had to play this gauntlet of games in September the ... the brewers didn't\nYou remember right before the all star break the birthplace twenty games in Twenty one I'm Twenty one games and twenty days and they had that losing because they lost all five games and that fighting set against the pirates right before the summer classic\nAnd they were just out of gas and I think that's what we've seen with the cubs are in the month of September and they just ran out of gas meanwhile the brewers lay the schedule makers made it\nThey had every Thursday off and they had at least one day off I think through each of the last five or six weeks of the season that huge role in the brewers being able to make up that by game deficit lot's changed\nIn this game trust in the eyes of an old man who's been sitting stands for a long time I mean and and just in recent years may have seen changes in baseball but they've been settled shifts but nothing like I've seen like maybe the last five ten years in terms of literally shifts the way infield shift done that they have charts on everybody and they know what they're going to do and\nDarn it if they don't do it I Can't be right there they're dead leaders that's what they are in their ... the shift is going to work up all this stuff about launching gulls and it's okay to strike out and all these other changes but I think the biggest change ... is the bulb it\nFrom the Nineteen fifties when that's where you put the rag guard was where the guys couldn't start games anymore and that's where you just put bodies finished games and he relied on your starters go the distance now it's a totally different baseball game it's changed the game completely and I'm not saying it's better to do just that it's changed the new reality you're bullpen now is everything\nAnd if you get three or four or five innings or you're starting pitcher it's quite a good to the point now where you got teams like the Tampa Bay rays\nIt's quite a good to the point now where you've got teams like the devil rays starting relievers the closures at the start of the game on the river so that both\n... started one batter and get yanked\nThey're ... they're not specialist at all when it comes to just get out when you step yet notes next man up and that's one of the biggest differences
