Houston and then the president of rally the crowd tried to gin up support for his fellow Republican going into the metro which is two weeks from to date you\nAgain one of the things that I noticed in looking for something to social media and some other reports this morning on big take away from last night with that the president referred to himself as a nationalist\nYeah yeah I I'm not sure if he understands kind of a deeper meaning of that that the implications of it but uh yeah he's he's waited in those waters before and and uh he's willing to uh to deal with the consequences at some point

visit on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz to Texas last like what are the polls showing between cruise in ... in terms of who's going to prevail two weeks from now\nWell there's still a lot closer that I think Ted Cruz or would have expected a year ago and probably the battle a record of expect that a year ago a there within nine ten point something like that or it's it's not a comfortable lead protect cruise I think that's why they brought the president down here last night to campaign on his behalf\nBut still I don't think any polls right now are showing O'Rourke ahead of ... or ... as easily out raised him in fundraising it out there that fundraising something like three to one a but a cruise I think still enjoys a lead over or two weeks before the election\nGuinea mentioned that the president said that that ... open borders is that accurate\n[noise] no I mean he's talked Iraq has talked about their border control and and what he calls sensible a border protection down there but uh you is for amnesty and for a sanctuary cities have the sort that are scattered rock taxes and other states I think\nUm so you know he he does walk that more liberal line certainly that
