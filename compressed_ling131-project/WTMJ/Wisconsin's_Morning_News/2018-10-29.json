media calls after these things happen that that has slowed down but now it's it's actually there's this weird fraternity of people that have gone through this stuff so I hear from them so people send me thoughts and prayers remembering Oak Creek when a new tragedy plays out somewhere else in the country\nIn that particular instance tape what Matt gunmen inspired by a particular a story that was in the news or with this just generalized dislike for for people in the Sikh community\nNo I think it was it was the second thing is just the ladder but he was he was fueled by hate a because it was a white supremacy and ... and his personal story was one that had just had a tragedy after tragedy after tragedy in his own life\nAnd all kinds of ramped up his hatred and his vitriol towards one group the the actual nuances of when and when when he decided to carry out his act that's still you know unknown because he was killed\nAs this fraternity grows as this list of tragedy screws we keep hearing the same arguments that same discussions about how to stop it and in that fraternity I'm guessing nobody there has any answers either really\nThere's there there aren't any easy answers that you know I I've said this for a while now at least five years that the short term it's just better security and uh that's not foolproof either long term\nThere's societal issues there's issues with the way people deal with each other this the the the ability for people to latch on the Web sites to fuel this hatred of groups people they've never met\nLong term the way you fix this is I think as people start to relate to each other better but that's a much more complicated process I I'm very optimistic about young people I think they get it but the fact that we have people like like the shooter in Pittsburgh that are just so driven by hate makes it very hard to put to clamp down on these things\nLine and let's see Jessica and he needed after that ... out of the Pittsburgh massacre that if there hadn't been an armed guard there that might not have happened but he the gunman shot for police officers\nThat argument it only goes so far that it it I'm not going to say that the increased security wouldn't have helped you never know that but the fact that there were a\nPolice officers injured in these things you know you you can't there's no absolutes here this is a difficult problem that requires a lot of smart people the way you fix it does not to lash out against other people you you have\nTo have conversations that actually make a meaningful progress that's not happening\nYou know this whole societal issue of people getting the news they want to see and hear and just doing that constantly on both sides this doesn't seem to be a big thing at all certainly that would that would come to find out that there are chat rooms that that welcome the extremists actually even monetize it yeah make money selling this\nYou know we're a country that that allows people a lot of freedoms and with those freedoms have these these are risks of people they gather together to do things that are really inspired only by hates and the desire to act out against another group of people and you know the Jewish people have suffered for thousands of years\nThe fact that we see this rise in anti anti Semitism is is dangerous for a lot of different reasons that's something we have to pay attention to and I'm going to have a a local rabbi on to them and have a lot of ... up in the market just federation\nTalking about what they feel when these things happen in our country and it's it's a horrible horrible feeling to think that you're being persecuted for your faith\nWell and I think to Nancy kind of alluded to see the more we stay in our own levels and I
