J. good morning mark\nHow are you they've got not bad [noise]\nBaseball I'm curious to get your thoughts I Know you've been to a bunch of these games and a bunch of these playoff games what impact have you seen\nLocally can we quantify the impact of the playoff run just based on your expertise and analysis\nHere on the I don't think you put an exact dollar amount about it but there's no I mean there's no question it's been great for the city\nIt's been great for the sponsors think I think a a Miller corps and all the all the attention if I could think of George Web and all the attention is getting big of all the businesses where are you seeing all this mess with us and for the brewers I mean this is great for them this year but uh but you know it's always great for that team the really the next year\nThey call the sponsors or going to want their name with them next year they call the season tickets are going to be sold next year I mean they're going to have I mean that a great year this year off the field they are going to have an incredible year next year because of their success and I think because people think that it's not a one year hit\nI mean if they're set up for three or four years of this is going to be great financially for them\nI'm curious to get your thoughts as well by served for them I don't know if it's lost in all of this brewers um hype and and chatter and excitement but\nSpicer forum friday night the official regular season opener for the bucks but my gosh the lead up to that with the concerts after concerts after shows and you were at the eagles last week um if that impact as well has been remarkable\nIt really has I think that's showing people the real impact of the rain I mean the bucks in there\nWas great you had a full house and it's really cool but think about it for four nights other than the box opener from you you mean you had the foo fighters and the eagles and Metallica and the Twenty one ... I mean think of all the fans that were there I Know for the eagles show I mean the lines for the merchandise were were\nWere hardly law ... I mean at the concession stands are selling lots of stuff I mean they're making a lot of money this week it was great for the building is also great to try it out\nBecause you see all kinds of things like ... and I mean I'll tell you I was impressed it was the first show I ... and the sound there is great so much better than the pilots on it because it's so open\nAnd the food was good at it which is a great experience but it's great for the city I mean on a Thursday night I mean down town I'm In a world there she wasn't hacked you can get near there and that's good for the city and I think it's happening a lot more and you're bringing huge acts acts that have not come here as often as a as obviously with a browser\nOne of the other big stories that are you guys covered this past week looking at the governor's race\nAnd the angle of where business executives are kind of throwing their support and I guess maybe just as importantly more importantly their money so they can be kind of relate what you guys found when it comes to the Walker Uber's raised some where some of these execs are going with their wallet\nProbably not surprised a lot of them are going to Scott Walker I mean he's a lot of support in the business community ... years and that's the part of my money he's raised a ton of money and they're now I've seen some inroads reverse [noise] you know he's got some pretty high profile names behind them kinda like Alex ... in the box and some of the other people like that\nHave been behind him so he's getting more but it's still Scott Walker I'm In the business community is very pleased what he has done from an economical standpoint from a air regulations that boy so he has the support now is it enough I mean is that enough to offset what's going on in this country with the blue wave will shape but there is no doubt if it was an election from the business exact it would be a Scott Walker when\n... kind of thing on the political tone for just a bit longer\nAnd ... kind of thing on the political tone for just to be longer it's been interesting to watch the on again off again relationship maybe that's too strong a phrase when it comes to President Trump and Harley Davidson and we we seem to be in this little bit of a low period where we haven't heard much on that front\nWas kind of quiet right now which I think Harley loves hardly I mean quietly will say how awful it was fun to be put in that position to have the the the\nObviously the head of the country aiming at you almost every day every couple of hours so for damage really been quiet which is good when what I find interesting is just from speaking to people about it you know hardly handle that one pretty while they were quiet they didn't engage with the president they didn't go back and forth with them\nAs others have and their brand is strongly we've talked to a lot of the writers a lot of visitors in the area and they were and kind of what they've heard is that the Brian kind of worn out people love the Harley brand they love the Harley name and that's you know kind of water highly as has successful as it has been\nAnd really if he hasn't come back to what I think this issue is over for them obviously I think of it what if anything happens in it for them obviously moving the jobs that a country it's going to come back but for now how is on a good spot\nTalking with mark Hasse says we always do every weekend here in Wisconsin's weekend morning news the last point I Want to bring up is something that has been\nOf interest to me now for a long time and that is the the state of Mitchell international airport and we heard some news again as you guys covered this week another announcement of a major potential major renovation so what are those plans what's the latest there on on this or whether they finally moved\nTo head on the plants are international terminal and that's the area\nAs you're walking on the on the south fat old terminals really not use right now so they're going to turn that into the national national trouble now is actually\nOn a in a whole other buildings in the current terminal so that would really help I think there's a lot of work that's been kind of plan for the airport this got looked at your national trauma be first after that would be a ... a ... one security entrance\nAnd we think about all other airports are almost I had a pretty good you enter once and then you can walk around and you hit the retailers you hit the restaurants you go to all the gates\nIn Milwaukee there's three there are three points of insurance\nI mean you got to go through a three different security access so I mean if you arrive on an American fight and you're living on the southwest like you have to leave through security and you have to go back through security again and you want to try a restaurant in one of the other terminals you've got to go through security again very inefficient very hard for people to fight and I think that has really hurt the airport\nWe've seen and we have less than a minute left but I'm just curious to get your your answer to this week we've seen some of the recent um\nChanges in terms of the look the airport looks nicer than it did five ten years ago and we've seen other tweaks along the way and there's been a leadership changes\nBut what's the biggest challenge facing Mitchell international airport moving forward because it's just not what it once was and nobody can say and convince me otherwise\nRight no I agree with you on a ... percent but it's more flights it's more direct flights main that's the key to get direct flights execs will fight through there and you can draw more out of northern Illinois I think it's slowly working back but it really has a ways to go\nUse mark Hasse senator Markey Business Journal by what am I on Twitter at mark Katz M.

I don't know what's being taught at those schools precisely but what I can tell you that recent studies show that the lack of basic financial literacy skills\nUm they're not being taught anywhere it to anyone a less than forty percent of people nowadays can answer for out of six questions and a basic financial literacy exam a twenty five percent of Americans have used a payday loan store titled loans store in the last five years\nOf forty percent of Americans couldn't cover a four hundred dollar emergency without either taking out a loan or having to sell something in order to cover the expense\nA small businesses which are the economic engine which drives this nation uh only Fifteen Percent of Americans report earning income from a business that was not directly tied to either salary or wages which tells me that a lot of people are not using small businesses in order to create wealth for themselves\nCNBC reported last year that Seventy eight percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck including ten percent of those Americans that are making six figure incomes so this is a it's a harder to conclude\nThat financial literacy and free enterprise are barely being taught anywhere to anyone at any time much less at the high school level\nAnd I got to believe are sponsors waters don't bank would be all in on this whole thing with financial literacy now you're Shannon ... worth Esquire\nIs an attorney getting involved with something like this\nUh will primarily I was a business law attorney for twelve years yeah anecdotally I used to lament along with our partners how little economic and finance education that people had a at every economic level\nUh after I left the business law firm was a commercial it again for about twelve years at a law firm down on the east side I Would write about issues of inner city culture of violence and about economic prosperity and in my opinion that economic prosperity\nIs the only way to ensure peace and stability in our communities\nSo these were issues that are that were important to me many years ago and then the last three years I spent in the da's office ... county\nAnd I really started to ask myself what if I had the opportunity to reach some of these young people are and show them a different path before they make the decisions that line them up in the criminal justice system in my opinion then I've done some real crime prevention\nWell Shannon thanks for being on the show to the best of luck with Milwaukee Lutherans free enterprise academy working people quickly reach you\nGo to our website um all of our uh\nAcademies are free enterprise information is there they can get a hold of me using the phone number the email if you are partner in the business community or you just want to know more about what's going on please read just call us any time\nThis is an important topic in the economy today too many schools are teaching socialism in ... quite frankly communism and seeing the excesses of greed that if you come from a capital a structure but the truth is no structure is perfect and no structure helps individuals with a dream\nEditor of the succeed more than the free enterprise system that we have in place in our country today\nNot succeeding of the current market place with record low unemployment that is tied to look at the choices you've made rather than the structure that's in place\nThis is Dr dams a family business a legacy Institute wishing you a great weekend and has always remember\nGod Bless that was all business with Dr David ... of the family business legacy Institute tune it again next week is the welcomes in another local business six twenty seven on WGM Jay\nYou deserve to get it fixed right the first time this is\nGrace missile quality with a man of the red than is rigorously trained to always be at the top of his game so your heating or air conditioning problems can be as fast as humanly possible hey when it's boiling hot outside or freezing home\nDoing your job right right away how even more quality eating and the manner of animals do all he can get your job right the first [noise]\n\nMulti stage variables these permanent shirts even home temperatures during the coldest winter weather and the than motor your cats engineered get authorization to and that matters because when it comes to your energy bill electricity efficiency is just as important gas\nSo when you hear bill right built by you are you can bet man in the event and he'll tell you more about why high efficiency your friend is your best to try [noise]\nAfter installation if you want it done right call All right all the way home and remodeling\nThat the L.

because actually we haven't even started ball planting yet\nOh if you start to early was are you where you were talking about what the heck we're talking about tulips daffodils ... says these are the balls that you plant in the fall that bloom in the spring\nSo if you plant them too early in the soil temperature still really warm and we're getting rain and everything then they start to come up then we get phone calls and to the radio show saying I planted my ball now coming up what do I do so yeah so ideally you do want to wait until temperatures are staying fairly cool\nUm because then you get them in the ground they'll start growing roots over the winter which is awesome but the tops will start coming up yet and so we are just moving now actually into the period of time we're ball planting would\nBe great to do and the pointy end goes which way up\nThe hill with regard to his firms and things\nThat the any kind of two versus like that you still can get those in the ground the big thing you want to make sure that when you plant any perennial flower at this time of year you need to talk eight in nice and tight\nSo when you dig a hole and you get that plant in there don't plant it really deep that's not what I'm saying just when you planted and you put the soil around it use your your fist and get that plant seated nice and from down in the soil and water and and really well what you're trying to avoid is that plant\nA heating when the ground search to freeze and thought so get watered in so it can start getting some roots going yet before winter starts and

can tell you that all those people are right how 'bout that isn't that something yeah it actually it depends on what kind of hide range on the one type of ... it has a big round white blossom on it that would be an anti belt type age range of those who get cut back to about six or eight inches tall in the fall every year or early spring\nNow the other kind of danger and endless summer or big leaf type age range are they have more of a pink or blue blossom mhm those you don't cut back in the fall okay you can take my old flower heads off if you want once they're dry but as far as the stands you leave those and\nOff if you want once they're dry but as far as the stands you leave those until spring and you do very minimal pruning on and they got some dead stop you take it off in the spring but otherwise kind of leave him alone\nOh really and then you add one other kind of hide ranging that's called the ... their blossoms are kind of oval in shape sometimes they start out creamy color but then they turn pink as as the summer progress is\nRight that tie dye drain joke that can be proven in the fall or in the spring and generally you don't cut those all the way back you would maybe take a third so if it's four feet tall right now he maybe he can pull it off and kind of stuff that structure up for next year okay that help\nYes and then now I kind of like at the height their act so next spring just had him down like cops either way and then it's okay\nIf you like the height they are right now they they'll grow a oh anywhere between a foot in two feet of years if you like what they are right now than yeah spraying you could go ahead and cutting back a ways that ... thing and then by this time next year they'll be back up where they are right now perfect\n... ...
