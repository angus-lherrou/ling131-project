like a cane conservative or more of a constitutional type conservative I've been that way for oh about twenty five thirty years\nAnyway so the story I have is such a quick one what I Do is I uh as I make car bodies for a living so what I Do is I travel around I have a lot of private to customers what they do is they hire me privately shorter was doing was this guy was living in Calgary\nGuys as well as the ... that that will have a you can come and have a look what I'm building come up for three months Fifteen\nBuild them part of the car that I go back ... refinish up shop and I'm just about to move my shop\nWell isn't it the end job gets in all of a sudden a day later I get this email from saying\nI have just a just a just found out that ah the Trump has been elected all the people from the all right all my friends are depressed and angry oh it's flushed like a little windy windy session\nAnd he said I'm so we cannot talk politics anymore and mind you this guy's been sixty grand putting a big huge ad in the um the globe and mail for a for Trudeau back in Fifteen when he won so he's big to do guy\nMeanwhile he has nothing to disable Trump so we cannot talk politics I stole moved here I was a little scared it was like that might do I still have the job so we can't even discuss politics in politics that means\nBut when I was hearing Fifteen everything was peach you because his sided one well now all of a sudden I didn't when I'm at you know what and I'm a bad guy and I'm In a little place called Latin and the and there's it's the country here so it's there's a few more conservative types here more Christians uh which I get along with just great\nUm but when you go into Vancouver shift like Seattle it's the same thing you if I put my maggot hat in the back

taking my call ah\nYeah I mean I I just wanted to call in and say um\nWell first of all I'm proud to be an American and I'm proud of myself to shit man the fact that we're a country of laws and not a man I'm so but but on the subject of Trump that has a\nKind of controversial uh sometimes um you know uh nobody's perfect and we got to point out where uh people have lost them and I get into humble with both sides out here um\nBut I'll be the first one to tell a all my relatives and friends that uh the problem is not\nA big section of branch the problem is a our Congress and and the fact that uh they block out a third parties consistently and so\nI've been calling on the libertarians and the greens to get together under one tent and helps break into the house so that we can have a working government again I'm so that that's pretty much my bit ah\nYeah well I'll tell you that the libertarians agree that's a interesting conversation a combination right there let's go to Terry in Johnstown, Pennsylvania you're on with mark\nFor your time here how're you doing\nA lot of fun but I'm here I was a bad law within or\nLiving in lower will hurt the law will go out and all that we can go to the old ... to earth and it does work\nA little over ... that he's doing his job which I think he's doing very well we don't talk politics at all because\nThey just start model [noise] uh as far as I'm concerned the man is all the quality in everybody but war so he's got his blog is a human being and people don't realize that [noise]\nAnd I appreciate that I think you're absolutely right let's go to Howard in New York City you're on with mark\nHi I just wanted to cover for items would prove about the Democrats the first one is one Obama went up people didn't listen to what you get get his number right away when he made a speech in Egypt in March of two thousand nine\nBasically what he said in that speech was the U.S was to blame for a lot of things instead of saying the U.S made some mistakes and ah we we we meant well but we didn't do it he was knocking to us at knocking it down\nLike he was the enemy of the u._s. people and then he he uh\nHe uh didn't invite Mubarak of Egypt a vital his enemy there so you go get him overthrown\nAnd and and Chuck Schumer in two thousand eleven locally said that we got to do something about the first amendment\nUh here in New York you know because that one but two thousand her life and it didn't carry much weight because we weren't that liberal at that time we have to control it because people are saying bad things about a candidate and then the the third thing was we spend God see\nWhen or when he went off and he went to a after the four people got killed the next day he Wendy was scheduled to go to raise money on the coast that he's still went\nAnd blame that on that disk you know the thing and the and the one that he really should have gotten impeached for definitely was when the when the insurance companies say one or two and a half billion dollars more for Obamacare now maybe they needed it and maybe they didn't that someone at that point the Congress wouldn't give it to them\nAnd he took the two and a half billion out of the treasury which he has no authority to do it all and gave it to them and even if they did nothing about it\nAnd that's a minor stuff 'cause what he used to do Obama is every hour on the second he would lie to you and people would that stupid because it not detail what I Try to explain something to someone because I'm a very detail person\nThey don't want to listen haven't got the Beijing so maybe they have an IQ of mine is forty\nThank you for giving me the chance to speak up\nYeah what what you did very well as you got all foreigner I wasn't sure the first one if we're done
