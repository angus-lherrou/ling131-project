further it's it never happened every president calls for unity every person calls for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you have created a divisive atmosphere how stupid are we\n\nHow stupid is the media\nThey're not stupid there they believe but it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population disagrees with you\nA good portion of the population disagrees with you [laughter] it is impossible for a politician\nTo create unity in a country\nBecause we say it has value or the the participation trophy or we say well the

TMZ dot com no for an instructional video\nFor an instructional video [noise]\nThan radio he is are currently and I'm Mary McNamara eight six six Ninety read I was just looking at a\nFox News article from a Newt Gingrich a ... and remember they contract with America that that he had come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with 'cause he's talking about ... proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember healthcare is one of the leading issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it is their fault for not solving the problem of health care and not going in with the plan right and he talks about you know of of a budget you know that that they that they should take\nPayers are middle men we believe in a competitive healthcare market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare\nInterferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less has access to treatment and lead to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system\nAnd America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick is too much less effective\nIn helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the\nRepublican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the or a six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people real like Republicans majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states that states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nRight and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring\nAdditional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximized medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure of the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan\nShould should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this if this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this is two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah it sounds like it's not going to work\nUh now we're inside of the week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nUm because that's who's preaching to but you're right with a ... Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about in twenty sixteen although they were going to do away with with Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then a undid the funding mechanism and then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're saying\nAnd we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen and the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it yeah why because it's one of the top issues than Americans care\nWell because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the Senate by the American people is is shifting on health care and this and this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling this is what they want and this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do\nThe new Congress wrote it because he saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way we got criticism ... we are criticism we got criticism when we sat there not repealing Obamacare right stop saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they just they were what were they were doing was repealing what\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums\nBut you didn't solve any of the problems right\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately there should have been the president and and and this is why we have said\nThat we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system\nOf government monopoly running our health care system and this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and outside right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any capes fighting in a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks it was I liked about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm\nYou've got to take the hardy shoes and one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that that that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman\nBut you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns the number one thing that this president did as candidate was to what they do mileage well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a no Donald Jean what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the right now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem\nYou have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved this president easily\nCould point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up as a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to Kurt what they can do this\nTo be able to Kurt what they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people\nIn premiums\nAnd so\nYou ... and ... and pregnant and when he got out and in payments to the insurance company ... and and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult\nYou know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't in his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care\nIs well within this will happen\nI I Know unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for all\nRight well then that case she's going to start talking about yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nBecause if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore hell let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when really did mhm 'cause that was to cry and then the president falling to admit no well no we did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "30"}
