because\nIt was just too good because we we were talking about economic things yesterday and we're talking about uh the uh you know the ah corporate tax mhm and and as we said before I keep forgetting we always get new listeners but but uh I'd made the comment as we've made before that corporate taxes hurt the poor the most\nFamous person just wrote me just completely baffled by what did he or she doesn't have to corporations I had to explain to them\nNo or\nYou pay everything that a corporation is when you see is financed by the consumer\nYeah every right uh their their their profits were financed by you everything's financed by by private money to pay their taxes right or the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by the consumer your the consumer\nPay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they dealt tax on the consumer you don't see it directly\nAnd therefore what does it hurt the most who has the least expendable income the poor\nOr cobra electronic here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan\nNow we don't speculate to the point of conclusion right I'm On things that we don't have all the facts on 'em and and that's what it comes down to for me is that uh you the\nFrustration I think right now is with me at least is the fact that for the first time in a long time\nThe Republican Party is motivated by president who on many economic things and national things can get things done mhm\nFocus on those but beyond that build the momentum forward and you know got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know in talking about well you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah\nBlah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation we're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle\nThat win elections for you right that's who you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially\nTo put it in the president's ah you know we'll have to do my customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that\nThe the the one ... because it sounds like that's the one you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll do my job and then the ... and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look I'm Talking about you are right yeah this was going to change it and I'm Talking about my I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't\nGet their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not right there early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yeah if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that\nWe're talking about you're not part of that group the the Republicans but\nMore importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get a message out\nThere is there is this and and we continue to to fight this all the time where we would get people to call when you guys think that you can convince everybody\nOr we don't know ... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest scholars we get are people that are called the show and upset you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds they're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and he looks quaint it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have taught us out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them to different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that\nThe goal the goal is to win that the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate ... news a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people right if you guys don't understand the frustration out there you're kidding me jak he's\nLiked or just would you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah it's really\nA calm [laughter] it's always a very old high scenario it's like doing yoga all the time at a table going\nOh it's like sitting on a beach it's like they're just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure then and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that anger out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's\nGoal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be the ... the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mess of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be\nThe twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again debates you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side I'm On the side that I'm most closely related to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that's the only way they got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know do here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada of the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nUp to him becoming president and two thousand eight on hope and change\nTo just the other night Nevada bill ... who well I'm a well almost it was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win adapt well okay thanks captain obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay Kenny can you\nCan I ask about it and as we said a total lack of substance on actually getting the the the issue that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side and but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality and on the right it's not\nI still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate it's still always bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nTo learn how as you can help we encourage you to

I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim that we said\nWell I Believe they're dead about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the all the answers\nHelped make this is John John John John slum we said that the president and the Republicans are making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah Segarra made about law and the ... or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with Kavanaugh Anne Gorsuch you have to construct yeah you're\nRight on the ... or ...\nThat right and we want we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch of when you look at Obama most of what Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you use executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through the legislative branch yet\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term\nWell and and here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're going to take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise it we need to raise it to twenty five percent what I I I was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last of ministry ... tried they tried everything they could to step in the way a private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads bridges\nA P story according to their source that says that right and that's what National Review has referenced right and our headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites for picking that up\nWe don't know outside that Associated Press story\nThat doesn't say that right if you read the ... yeah that's that's the point is that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be yeah the caves and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those sorts ...\nFrom the Eighteen right you know so it it's just because the problem is is with with\nIf you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows ah may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they were just an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story ... I can understand because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the sun\nWas Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with a caller was harm you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that that\nThe narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that\nAnd\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which the national review to me is extremely credible at the time I I don't know maybe too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told you esoteric they're saying the bomb was harmless but this was in our personal meaning not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone up and would have gone off a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were\nMeant to just scare mhm or they were meant\nTo be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent prayed political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh\nWhen we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat\nThey're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody or an incident where they don't have the fact\nThey don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nI Know sources of so they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group of people based on that which area which is again that that the number of the number of of a device\nThe number of of ah devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve this and solve it pretty quickly mhm\n\nYeah if you look at the nature of how this was said uh the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr it could be multiple stamps it went through us ts um each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male uh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually as their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't stop delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know they may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now whether these were light bounce around me no right they haven't said that we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go wiping\nCould've been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in in Illinois ... is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy and I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it\nWell and if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nUh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right up the if the threat is real ... that were at that device word dangerous or we're\nReady to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\nYou've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we were seeing the pictures on on the on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with a CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the ... of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you but they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion\nThis creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund up or today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking

write\nA twelve days away from uh the uh the mid term elections I went out and early voted yesterday ... uh uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me right it was pouring rain and just pouring rain mhm and when\nIt was funny 'cause I've never even those campuses only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been to never drove through this community college ... drove through it in the science route front of them you know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building and saying I have no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because of political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fried or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little farther couple of more miles and I was going to go there and I said that I Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so\nHad about a thousand foot ... pouring rain\nBut when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how ya doing everybody's laughing joke in what's going on all you're doing and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign\nYou know how you're ... you sign you know that okay so ... you don't sign any more you sign on a tablet ignoring the tablet around your side right on the tablet ... you know with the little pencil where I could just go to side with my finger I said this is new they should yet makes it real easy um\nProbably because there was nobody behind me in line\nOr just have to just general conversation\nYou know as we've been busy the grains affecting if they said yeah the reins affecting the today because it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm a college campus for young people voting\nNever felt the need or the or never even come to my mind when when I used to do a lot more speeches I\nDon't do a lot anymore because just because of the time shift a used to do all the time you know public speaking all I never told people go out and vote ... ... because number one I never felt that was my real number two I never felt the people that were listening to what I had to say I had to be encouraged about well\nThis is the great thing about especially our audience I I think the the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think\nBeyond or just new listeners the ones that have been with us for a while\nI Believe there you know we're all kind of standing in the in that same line ... were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leading themselves I Know they need me to say it and they know\nThey don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that a bat that understanding and\nAnd the only thing I and I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know were needed for\nThe fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their ... they got their families and our job any of them were eating right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have we have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day\nAnd what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and and I would say that's about it now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] I mean that that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of information that right I mean there are there people out there that it and many of them\nOn the

that has to happen but you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material costs especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\n... member also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming until NAFTA is actually sign right or whatever it is the new now but even then we're not going to have you All right\nUh but as far as an end so housing has gone up you know we look at there is an apartment complex behind us and\nAnd it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred there it's pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept it it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you wouldn't hire totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow is a labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer or in North Dallas\nFor video wrote a blog here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the north east for the Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes and that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains\nAnd at times decide to get into the mud when there's no reason to get into the mud right as we said you do for the win every single time once you get that when you move on to the next when you don't weaken your when\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from uh the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have not just about the attack that they are for open\nBorders bang go we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and uh earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want he\nSaid again I have argued outs where the party should have embraced and immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years\nBecause when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a was a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which\nThe Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions to couple of weeks after you and I started working together right and so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssue them the challenge and that's what we've shown is saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't then they some of them don't agree\nWith the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats want border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration\nThis country are blacks and Hispanics mhm\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf\nOf\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration but even Trump has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nMhm no the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically\nBut the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you do with the president wants you know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people\n\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here\nRight do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to what we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement what have you been to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't do after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in\nThe United states so why are you preaching that\nNow that stuck was shown whose looks like to me as if the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that wants the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who and I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting his Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoted that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\n... political battle ... how can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right\nExcept for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "28"}
