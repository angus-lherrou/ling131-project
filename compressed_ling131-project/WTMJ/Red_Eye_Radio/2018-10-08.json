California a mark Marty welcome higher on radio walk into the show\nYou guys great show as usual thanks like I had a ... and I don't know that it's relevant but I think that if mark judge word to possibly\nA super slander\nA stock report or other not eat whatever his name is uh\nUh I think that we do some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in the effort because I agree with you guys are going to continue to add on this guy um but I think that if judge where the super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yep he could not under the same rules of capping off or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nWhen I brought it would slow them down that would give them food for food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there maybe there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public a through this with with the league and everything else\nAh that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the lead to the media and all that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak forward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have in a case\nBrought by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible for getting his name out there and that you can see I think part of that and they have in any case yeah that was that was him\nYes to dedicate eliminate because ... they get the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash on the gators you wouldn't want to put his good buddy or\nDo they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got chipper problems and I wouldn't want them to think that there are these joined us in spite of using his buddy to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every\nPredictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come they use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question uh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as the capital capital dead\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of ... these particular claims um and really the only one that is that survived at all was Dr ... claim\nReally the only one that is that survived the role was Dr forged claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I Am and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctors were right I'm just using right that that as a possible exception here right uh but with the other case\nTo me that's clear I mean going going after capital with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time and their public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm biking drinks you know like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out in print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nDirectly let's go to Gary in sparks Nevada carrier on Radio Welcome to the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you ... got his um\nThe Republicans they keep complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody's life for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or die and find fan and so on it's like telling a a a bank robber I'm complaining about it\nWe were both well we're not going to hell whoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang\nOkay well I Know I I ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge Ford who is an excellent\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with ... she has a spy or a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that and I believe they have that in their problem is they're they're ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell ... that's ... I've followed that wasn't Republicans fault no I don't buy\nThat was combing who clearly was politically driven and and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese you know with I don't I don't want to get them but what\nDoes this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen amounts of loss\nIt is but because the reasoning Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office\nWould bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with ah with Hillary or even back to lying about bin ... which was an ending of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we said\nIs that on the email is typically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would a prosecutor we said well it\nWhat matters here's the court of public opinion what you're dead and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's here's\nThe uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... and the veterans responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said a of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness dating she's lying about it right\nUh you know or it was you know I you know I I don't I'm I'm\nTrying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character way when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah ah any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nYes and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't win the seat so they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed ... ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we age point Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nSo if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged because there is a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty wouldn't want her charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know of some\nOf his bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure taught me laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon gives me you're the one the ... and I'm ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you can read the law and and everybody would agreement that is what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that can't do anything about it\nThe best that we can hope for in any thing is if the truth is told I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we've we've got a couple of allies said don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh\nSo we're going to give it to Michael ... we went that doesn't make a Michael ... we're going to go to Michael Horowitz from my daughter to my God [laughter] he's missed them and they don't have to [laughter] whatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went dead\nMhm 'cause it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story has been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's gonna happen there but get is a true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's on that and that's that\nThat's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it\nWhole Russians scandal thing we've said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls\n... regardless of where it falls politically as long as it as fully transparent and\nThe process the American people can decide\n\nUp because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all whose stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this will play out in the public over and over and over\nFor a very very long time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nFor your goals ... must be read on the radio
