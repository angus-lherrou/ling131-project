investigation going on Papadopoulos is loose talk\nUh overseas about Russian typing dirt on Hillary Clinton prompted a an FBI investigation into election interference what we're finding out\nOr without talking about specific some what is going on is the whole reason that this investigation was opened up was certainly not built on a solid foundation medals told reporters he added that some\nJustice Department an FBI staffer should be referred to the department of justice's office of professional responsibility to determine whether proper protocol was followed and I'm certainly willing to encourage that\nThe Republicans and Democrats are painted partisan portraits of Papadopoulos as a witness wrapped up describing him as very forthcoming he's providing as much information as he has Ratcliffe said I think he's trying to understand how would Twenty one year olds are to me at twenty eight year old\nA campaign advisor who'd been on the job for less than a month has been embroiled in the highest profile investigation in recent times\nHis testimony here today is certainly unique an eye opening and very different in terms of what I had come to understand from other

general because we were still we were both of them for the first twenty four hours not understand why she's going to the inspector jump doesn't make any sense as of right\nAnd all of a sudden one day on the air mhm this one I think it was the day after or whatever we said oh wait a minute because we were we were like\nBaffled ... because they were making the explanation is if we can't do this because it could be due dead do damaging some of the top secret store allies and therefore we're giving it to the inspector general more like why why would you get an inspector general if there were oh wait a minute inspector general ... looks at corruption you believe there's ...\nAll right uh because if you look at the the\nThe scenario in the great possibility of how this went down it wasn't our foreign uh out at what it wasn't our allies wasn't you know Great Britain or anyone else that was that was starting this in order to derail trumpet it happened here at home\nWhich means that someone in the Justice Department in this case I quite possibly was was beginning this entire thing so worrying about what our allies are concerned with really wouldn't concern the inspector general's

people getting frustrated saying what's going on\nYou know I thought they might use this with the midterms are coming up now the inspector general now that they're ... it's outside of\nThe authority now of Congress because inspector general right as a part of the executive branch so\nOr whether the Democrats take the house or not is not going to stop the inspector general right but one wonders that before we lose if we do you if the Republicans lose the house\nThat this all stops just investigation stopped\nSo you better if they win you better get as much information out as possible that you went out to the American public ... otherwise\nThe fear is it will be buried mhm and the American public will not know the truth because the Democrats and nobody's ever argue this we've said that

charisma though and I understand what she did you know for the campaign but really that charisma was carried\nBy by Trump the ball I so I I Know I so I don't know if of course I mean after you know after you're done as an advisor\nTwo percentage points from that growth rate\nThe concern is as we've said before is wants to government spending moderate\nThan that increase goes away\nAnd as we said before the true growth\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president\nOr the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to\nA Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense than no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how would apply all the economy's doing so without the increase in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent\nUp from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending\nRight since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last roughly a year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we have taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who used to agree with us\nBut now disagree with us on the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've said it doesn't matter who you are as a matter of whether you call yourself a Republican a conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in good in the marketplace benefits the economy\nThen you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in\nThe United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas which was what the president claimed\nHe wanted on trade and we will continue to stay on tariffs the president just all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAnd as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then his actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the growth is in the private sector or where the lack of growth is in the ... in the end of that\nYou do yes you you do have to separate the two because government spending even for a\nQuip mend even though there was a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not ... it's out why you do it but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increase of that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector\nBecause a multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something that makes somebody else else's life more efficient or make their business more efficient they use it and it's a combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having economic growth thinking assume our society thinking of smartphone yet you know like\nIt so that that is that that great demand because it's at that because it's\nCreate that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier or create that huge expansion in wealth and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nOn defense spending you will build the initial product ... but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business mhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how that\nHelps the GDP but you're creating something you're using debt down the road it's where you get the funding ... by long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector to improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity of other businesses down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy\nYes and that I made a difference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism and general yeah and the role right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples uh do\nAnd I and I and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of home building now when the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... until the deal is signed are still on with the with with Canada the increase you you talk about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talk about what ... what the consumer marketplace and try the economy it's housing and cars both have been targeted by terrorists\n... we haven't even talked about food yet and want to drive that might be down on the road for and the big terrorists haven't even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House\nWhen it comes to\nEconomics and I have no idea where has has the ... Congress talked about and\n... about what they're going to do with a new NAFTA there'd been I don't know I I'll zero talk on\nWhat happens if you because they want to get this done\nSoon and what happens when the house if the house goes to the Democrats\nKnow can they get this thing done by the end of December can they get this through\nThe end is because we're talking about what to the Republicans have they feel about it but we're not we're not sure young even forget about what we talk about the the house turning blue\nWe have to talk about and that the the Republicans right now and given or a assuming that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year\nI mean that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year\nAnd so you have to ask what are the plans because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right\nAnd you're eels was in ... you're you're seeing some of the earnings reports coming out from major companies um a number of them\nUh the that was a certain ... or other came out a and you have for you had a ... with their with their foreign sales as a result of brutality retaliatory tariffs a caterpillar and others that are talking about business losses as a result of the terrorist situation\nBut material cost I mean what about all the smaller companies and we talk about the contractors you know a Lockheed Martin is a given right but there are many smaller companies that are included in that tire process hundreds of men hundreds of company and the same with manufacturing\nRight on the on the private sector side with terrorists the material costs we started hearing from a you know the makers of appliances washers and dryers and everything else\nAre you and I both about the same time went through a the the water heater a purchase\nA few weeks apart from each other and we were both told by you know the parts of the job the costs are about to go up I Know for a fact that I have a family member who's in the commercial H. back business and their costs are going up the businesses is still doing strong but", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "26"}
