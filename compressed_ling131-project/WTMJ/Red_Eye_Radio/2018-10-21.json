fault the Dodgers the season\nComes to an end as they lose in game seven in the house yes my name's Matt Pauli one more hour to go we're taking you till one o'clock in the morning\nIf you want joined the program you can do so by calling or texting for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the acting that mortgage talking ... well here from Fox Sports Wisconsin's Jerry ... coming up and just a moment or so but right now will go back to the phones and welcoming Shelley who was at\nThe game show a year on WGM Jay\nI just want to go ahead no go ahead you're on the year\nI was just wondering what your thoughts are on and you are you think that will be a shoo in for next year or you have to come from the same thing ... and they're being he had a lot of overboard up and read it didn't seem like the second half and he has struggled\nYeah I I Do and appreciate the phone call Shelly I Do think that you are going to be the guy coming up next season I'm not convinced that Eric James makes sense for this team and this is not a shot\nAt the same so listen to to what I'm about to say here because I there's there's some explanation that goes along with it I think Eric James needs to be given an opportunity to get regular playing time and I think that regular playing time needs to come\nFirst base or if if there was an American league situation maybe as a designated hitter I see him in the outfield eventually I think he gets a little bit exposed\nI'm not convinced that the brewers\nUs have the bats available for Eric seems to be his best self\nSo moving on from ... teams might make sense just to make sure that you're able to ah you're able to give him an opportunity to be successful there are some guys out there and there's a shot at them that it's a very normal thing in baseball there are some guys out there\nThat they need the regular every day at bats to be to be their best and we saw from from Eric themes and once you kind of lost that job at first base when he came back from injury\nThat he just really struggled the moments of success were very much a hit and miss kind of thing\nAnd I I I almost I like having I I Love talk of their claims he's a great guy is a great interview\nI miss not having them around if he ended up not being a with this organization anymore but I Hope for him to have the opportunity to really have some success that maybe he ends up somewhere else now as far as age who say you argue mentioned\nSecond half of the season versus the first half it's it's pretty significant numbers pre all star break cases Aguilar to Ninety eight\nTwenty four home runs at Seventy R B eyes and O P s at nine Ninety five post all star break to forty five eleven home runs thirty eight or ... and it will be asked of seven sixty\nThis is what I'll say about ...\nHe has never been in every day guy over the course of a one hundred and sixty two game season it's not easy it is really really tough to be able to pull that off\nAnd uh I I take him going through the experience of this season is going to pay out some odd dividends moving forward but for me there's no reason to have to ... would not be back would not be the everyday first baseman for the brewers going into next season\nLet's bring in Fox Sports Wisconsin's Jerry Augustine and\nArgue it's always a bummer when the season comes to an end I I Do think that everybody can step back and realize that this was an amazingly fantastic season but it hit you like a ton of bricks when the season doesn't\nTrigger you know the income is a growing like tonight you extend it\nTo seven games after last quite so well and you got ... set up but it's just you know sometimes in baseball just doesn't work out and and and\nFor the ... ... ... ... ... men and back and never allowed the brewers are back in the ball game and create a bigger or prevent Omer really put the icing on the recording doctors\nReally just did not seem like shot scene at his best offer this was a regular season game you clearly would have been given\nIt really just did not seem like shot seen had his best stuff this was a regular season game you clearly would have been given an opportunity to try to work through it but the game seven against a good team like the Dodgers you don't really have time to let a guy works ruined what was your take away on what you saw from ... season I\nWell I think they are in the plan was ... I don't think there was blamed for the was a big out here for a very good out there and in a good situation\nI think what it did create it just seemed like he had his could break if I couldn't commanded it looked like a early in the ball game he was getting behind them a lot of interest we saw it on a on college and and one ... comments to start start a hitters often\nHe lives in telling the guy who really commands the strikes or early ... success you have a command the strikes don't want to break the ball and his fastball\nBut tonight that have a good break about if you look at the home run at the village are hit with the ... all that was right down the center of the middle of play every guy that could\nThat could part of a strike though that you that that was you know what happened barrier behind and ... had to make that will put you in a position that you could hopefully come back and get back to back in a cashier just there\nAre some jobs like we were able to put any restaurant deport\nDodgers pitching was really good it started with Walker view bealer I felt like once the\nDodgers gave him that lead he was able to just\nThrow his stuff and just go whack guys and ... was nasty Ryan maps and does a nice job and then they were able to get to can we danced in cleaning her saw to cover the final ah two three innings that uh we we talk so much about the brewers string bean pitching but with the way that the Dodgers\nUtilize them start or in the bullpen today clearly that was the strength for them\nWell one thing when you have a young picture of what happens is when he gives a he'd give up at all but to yell age and then they come back right that next happy ending a score to run he came out there and all of a sudden in past or close to start using those breakable stuff like that for the first day I think I saw a couple of like of all they they were very consistent\nLike he like he can be put through and he got to leave or he started getting at\nThat positive thing that will end up part in it as a young pitcher and he really to the ball well and you know you look at this ... this whole series uh uh the Dodgers star is really did a really good job and they were able to go a little bit deeper and the game then to brew pitchers in and utilize a bullpen effectively and\nI think that could be one of the one of the things that made the difference in the Syrians but a a bruise just go and do what they did how they had to do it against this Dodger ball club or I thought they just did an outstanding job\nAnd close the table with one finger and in

another forty minutes\nWe'll take you to one o'clock in the morning and then another year of brewers extra innings will eventually come to an end will get back to the phone calls and got the text messages to get too as well but first stop on the phones we've gotten Nick in Walker Sean Nick thanks for calling holding your on WGM Jay\nHey man\nHey morning now actually yes\nI wanted to or are they give you got the call those traveling and from work\nI'm and I'm a little bit more of lifted\nI talk to your screener before I actually heard or do you have a conversation with Augie that um you know my heart just heavy because I was watching the at work and I was watching you know on a\nOn a hill a live stream and it just said you know Dodgers a World Series and I saw the interview with Clinton crush on my heart was just thinking and I told your screener that\nI'm as pumped up and up to them about the horse you know this year\nMaybe my I guess a little bit of my ill founded here is now that we have a map\nUm I don't want to have to wait another Seventy years for this might happen again\nAgain that may be a little bit ill founded um we may have to wait a little bit before we get back to a series like this maybe we'll get back there again next year I'm anyway I'm just looking for a little bit of a\nUplifting\nEvent that I appreciate the phone call I think there is no reason not to expect that this team cannot be right back in this position moving forward now a lot of things can happen over the course of a one hundred and sixty two game season\nInjuries guys not performing to the level that they should perform all that sort of stop moves that backfire on you so I'm not going to sit here and guarantee that the brewers are going to be playing in the national league championship series next year but I Do think you look at this team and you say this team is set up\nTo ... to have success\nThey this core is going to be back I think it is if they are not a postseason team next year they will have under achieved it will be a disappointing performance I think it is completely valid to go into next year with the expectation that this is a post season team\nAnd you look at the teams that have had success over the last few years look at the Houston Astros last year\nYeah I Know there are other there they just got knocked out of the else yes but they they take that huge step forward and they keep it up they were very good team again this year\nThe Kansas City royals another organization that went through rebuild they got the first World Series they got back to the world series\nThe next year even a few years back when the cubs finally made it to the post season for the first time it wasn't long after that that they were winning a World Series and I know you probably don't want to hear about the cubs right now but I I think that the brewers are on that exact same trajectory\nWhere's this is not a one and done kind of situation David Stern has absolutely set this team up\nTo be able to have sustained success that's what they want to do here\nYeah they want to win a World Series that's important\nBut just as important and it's something that this this organization really hasn't had\nBecause you look at the different playoff appearances in this organization in any fee especially more so in recent history but you feel like they are kind of warning done situations the the goal of the David Stearns led to Milwaukee Brewers baseball operation\nIs to have a high level of success and to sustain it\nAnd I think they're going to be able to do that\nI Will go to Tim and Janesville hey Tim you're on WGM jak\nAre a great game just you know they live because of just seven game series and it was just it wasn't because we get\n... there was a great series to stay but there's no way you drift treatment it's basically money by the street or we want and draw her on the end he picked my early ... when nobody else wanted them because you can't just go out and buy three quarters of the year like\nEli jak scene when nobody else them here you can't just go by dream quite like the Yankees Red Sox got this year we have a budget and we know\nThat that is right on and I\nI think that saying that that's why for me David Stern says the executive of the year for the moves that were made of the off season to the moves that were made in season most of them the Johnston scope by trade not withstanding oh they they all work so well and that's that's a big part of this appreciate the phone\nCall up the\n... I I\n... I I I think the brewers are doing things a little bit differently what's going to be really fun to watch\nIs going to be after they've had this kind of success and using analytics in a certain way and viewing baseball and a certain way and try to get a lot of flexibility position players and pitching making sure to get good match ups the way they ship they shipped more than a team in baseball seems like\nA how much of that gets picked up by other teams\nMoving forward and I think we are going to see some of that one more phone call before we break at the bottom of the hour ago Steve who's calling all the way from San Francisco Hi Steve you're on WGM jak\nAll right we've lost Steve Steve I call back if you want that for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine

...\nFor the brewers yo ... shots being getting the starch Walker viewer will get the stark for the Dodgers that would be the brewers to break through first happened in the bottom of the first inning Christian yeah which comes to the plate with one out\n[noise]\n\nThings looking great for the brewers at that point with Christian yeah let's go and yard and the first inning but things would turn very very quickly ... would we know that would be the only run that the brewers would score tonight\nSo we go to the second is once again the number one public enemy in Milwaukee Mandy Machado what what\nWas going to be sure\nRule it any better than\nThat got the call by Machado putting down a bond with a couple of strikes against them but he does it any actually has a hospital down the first baseline something he admittedly says he doesn't like to do what do you get the budget single to get things going in the second next batter Cody Ballenger [noise]\n\nWhere are you going to do right center and very\nBig time all under\nOld you are\nAnd that one got out of here by plenty\n... watched that one [noise]\nBrewers in the bottom of the second any way to get a couple of heads from Mike restock it's in our window our CEO book could not get any one home and also the decision was made to pitch it released shot seems so after he goes just two innings he was lifted\nBore a pinch hitter and that would in the day or shot themes of Josh hater would come in to pitch in the thirty whatever one two three top of the third in the bottom of the third brewers looked like they might have something going Lorenzo can't leave the ending up with the base it\nBut the next senator Christian yeah which does this patch\nGround ball softly hit towards short Machado has steps on second throws the first time it's a double play six three on the double play and that takes some of those seem out of the year ... throwers\nAnd Ryan Braun would strike out so it started as a promising ending ends with just three batters coming to the plate\nJosh ... continuing to pitch for the brewers in to the board that I mean he would give up a basic demanding Machado when the fourth but then college Cody Ballenger would replace them on the basis reaching on a builder toys next hitter yeah feel weak\n[noise] delivery\nGrumble to third double play ball new stock is the second one first\nGo around the horn for\nOr get out of the poor thing with no damage done [noise]\nHater back out with a bit then he walks Chris Taylor to lead the any and all but then he strikes out Austin Barnes Walker bealer puts down a bump that allows tailored to move the second so runner on scoring position two outs and Kiki Hernandez that plate\nYep and that would be the end of the day poor Josh hate or his velocity was really dropping and clearly he's still got the strike out their Hernandez but\nHe did everything he could do for his three innings and they went on to another pitcher after that we'll get to that in just a moment as we go to the bottom of the first two brewers are retired but then back to the top of the order and were written so Cain would double that would end the day for Walker Mueller\nChristian yelling which would then come to the plate [noise]\n\nThe early on that one set of warning track of the wall at the brewery opens\nPainter ran down and made a heck of a catch\nThat's your play the game right there if you want to find a moment to in this game that makes the difference without a doubt is Taylor making a spectacular catch out in left field\nTo Rob Christian college ... would have been a run scoring extra base it and that would have tied the game up instead it's they they to one game ... by the way on the mound when that play happened\nSo to the bottom of the ... that are are too big to the top of the six then we would go\nNew picture comes in ... Daniel he's into based ... monthly would end up getting to be hit next to Josh Turner he faces Jeremy Jeffers who comes in Turner would get a base said so runners on at first and second\nMany Machado with them fly out that would break Cody balance or the place down there would reach ... builders choice were Turner without a second so that puts runners on average\nCorners Ballenger would steal second base but then ... has the biggest hit of the game [noise] now\nLine drawn to this is big trouble and it is going to get off there and\nDon't\n\nThe barrier or if the about in\nYeah that's a that puts the brewers in a really really tough situation\nIn the bottom of the any Ryan ... would come and he would pitch a one two three so we go to the sevens Jeremy Jeff are still on and she would give up and hits but he was still a and that would bring a court can naval on can naval facing max months due to finish off the any [noise]\nTo to pitch in the midst of all of the silver\nEnabled the ceiling strikes on backs among the [noise]\nYep so that's how a that anyone would come to an end and the bottom of the seven\nUh the brewers would get a runner on against Ryan mats and at that point the Dodgers go to their clothes or their brings are closer in in the seventh kingly Janson he would get Curtis Granderson to strike\nOut so we move along to the age as we go to the aid that Brandon Woodrow comes in to pitch for the brewers he's been so good over the course of the post season he would face just eternal you would strike them out she will face many Machado he would strike him out he would face ... [noise]\nGenerally Jansen continuing to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the eighth inning and once again the brewers go down one two threes to to the night with the brewers down by a five one score Brandon would drift continuing to pitch for the crew\nHe would give up the base it to ... you could double the Chris Taylor so that puts runners on at second and third nobody out he would get Austin Barnes to ground out without the runner coming home so there is your first out they would intentionally walk to pinch hitter Matt camp that load the bases\nKiki Hernandez would strike out next pattern ... [noise]\nThey do so he was fired up coming off the mound and we\nHad to the bottom of the ninth inning brewers needing for to tie five to win and here comes Clayton ... to finish it out not as safe\nSituation but chance to head to the ... first batter Travis Shashi grounds out second batter ... strikes out and that brings might stock is to the plate [noise]\nHere comes crucial and he's\nYep that's out finishes off as the Dodgers defeat the brewers in seven games in the NFL cs Dodgers get four wins the brewers get three\nTotal the Dodgers five runs ten hits nowhere as they leave six the brewers one run seven it's nowhere as they leave five the winning pitcher is Ryan mats and he is I Want to know when the ... shot seen it\nTakes to last for the brewers as he is one in one in the in the U.S home runs for the Dodgers ... we get shooting their first of the series Christian yell it's for the brewers it's his first of the series the game last seen\nFor a playoff game a tidy three hours in Fifteen minutes and it has played in front of a sellout\nAnd he has been in a credible a positive influence on on brewers extra innings you don't get producers and he's much more than a producer you don't get folks are like Ashton very often and WTO O.

at it as much as the way it used to be that you know you have your politics have your views and then there's two people right and you hope they're decent but it just is suggests the times we live in where people don't even want to sit down with the other side\nOr you know they're just so angry right I I don't blame you have to count on hearings\nI I wouldn't want to sit down with a sport I guess you know I think he's gotten any we've got to keep that going Booker\nKamala Harris would on a piece of work she is and the listening Pocahontas right the list goes on and on so I I get it that's why I came up with Bernie Sanders 'cause\nI don't know he is foolish as can be in my opinion but I mean when did he go to Brooklyn College where I Would I think he did\nUm and if he didn't he certainly from New York City and uh so I thought you know I could sit there with Bernie ... maybe it would walk away when he heard my views I don't know maybe they'd be intolerant but let me know what you think and let's go to a chat in Decatur, Illinois chatty Ron with mark\nAnd mark how're you doing to see real well and Eric what's good to hear\nA I Would like to see oh Alec Baldwin run for

present both sides of the stereotypes that at any of the innovation here as far as I Know and it children today are being ... it's a social\nUh it\nIt's terrible what's going on\nAnd I don't know ... people now my right to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you've got Trudeau now he's pretty pretty far left you had a good prime minister before that oh ... this\nWonderful and

new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or they when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy was you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's going to let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservatives talk shows are some liberals are most of them are not\nAmong many have you know what shepherd idea what what kind of a man if we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for video road law\nUh the left has already crazy and and so far out there let's see uh butch in Denver you're on with mark\nAnd mark how're you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it as having all the relationships friends\nFamily colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit things for five years ago because I just couldn't read it in some of the things people are writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and\nYou know say something I'd like to regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because\nIt was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nBack when Obama was president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good uh it was a lot of relationships you know\nStarted to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you became I've learned not to say much about politics or the ... when they know the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know try to\nSay all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I was going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think social media you're right\nIt had done some good but the uh like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook so I I think people should be cautious with the social media especially when we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked and they're finding out a lot of your information so\nAnd he had a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out she still listening I or I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty terrific the way that they you know all that up is she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians or aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to and this\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and a a\nAt a Charles Adler and and write and uh and green or\nAll of that probably helped a jet Obama or get a Trump elected\nBecause it was kind of hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you have the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected you know where his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama were really really disappointed at it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nWell I think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know colors should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is than he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rat Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really as he got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nUh know disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high mark that admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey I've got two observations and then a point to make\nA first of all you notice all\nThe calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the ... and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual\nNot the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country\nWhich specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know that they claim they're against fascism is example within ... fascist themselves\nAnd they you know when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what is this group think what is that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives\nSo I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right there for them to be the little guy and they they care about my minorities than they care about the basically for no they did\nThey just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the adult Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today the Democratic party that I as a kid supportive\nAnd someone said one of our callers and then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what
