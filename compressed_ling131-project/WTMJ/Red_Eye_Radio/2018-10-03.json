G. to all the investigation on it tell us what happened here because the ... going to have\nAccess to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans\nOn oversight committees and really the White House White House has been calling you know the echoing a the the uh the Trey Gowdy and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what you gotta G doesn't have to call for that the algae has access to it directly yet so the I G takes this\nAnd the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this uh on redacted material now from the Justice Department\nWill that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents\nBut the I have access to everything in the department of justice and any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively just declassified part of a life because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are you a context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about a ... that you know ... initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing\nRight\nAnd the media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\n\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they only Haley looks at corruption\nRight that's what he's lucky he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they react to this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material to his looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia pro Trump didn't say what Russia probe right which one which one because I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia probe we initially thought\nYou know could because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers in but there's this ... motors investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian pro\nRight and I went oh that must have been more investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be though it may not be the investigation that they're talking about you did well he Mahler he said Russia probe I'm like whoa now look at the pattern of behavior in the in the entire history of this\nThis whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right and what was that pattern of behavior leaks to the media how many of those leaks favored Trump or almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have the situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department\nThat are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side if if they're under redacted classified material\nHad damaging information about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case\nWould he also turned it over to the inspector general if it were\nBecause it wouldn't serve him politically I don't know it's not required to turn it over to the ...\nRight but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the up yeah in the department of\nJust I Know but what I'm saying is it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding something non GMO anger OK okay then by the way that it would actually do show was legit right or that it's going to go OK okay right that it is that the whole thing was legitimate and it was based on something real", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "03"}
