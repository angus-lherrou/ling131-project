like when somebody has to go back in twenty sixteen oh you're going to be surprised Trump's gonna when I said well actually we won't be because\nA history shows us that when you had this long of a down economy the opposition party usually wins and that that's what uh what what what happens what's gonna happen here I don't know it will tell you about you know you saw the NPR\nA poll that showed

amounts of rain and maybe even some local severe weather today including high winds hail and some locally produced thunderstorms and tornadoes is the central Midwest\nBut at its height at its peak\nI Can't say for certain that it was this kind of motivation across the board I think it was big but this is what this is different because\nOf the culture that's being created by the left and the media on the left this is this is different than an objection to high taxes and and things that are very real\nHere this is a a behavior a pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again\nAnd I remember uh other you know intense times that were based on a particular issue ... ah for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh and you had and and and even before that right or before the election uh you have the the passion when they talked about a bailout and you know in ... but that\nWasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there that existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together or not McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right uh the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that's where they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that what I've read\nThat was on a specific topic yeah I did harp\nSame thing right that's ... are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about this isn't really about Trump\nAnd reading right here it says look brighter than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write this the same day that you know you do the same week that you know you and I have in the same thought going while it was the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump\nWe're all deplorable now ah and it says you look at you know parts of the capital is a part of you know a isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nRight he's he's separate from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd and supportive of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump yes and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to weigh well except maybe for Bill Kristol\n[laughter] the one the one old out [laughter] except for Bill Christ and I haven't seen anything from George\nAnd it's like ... yeah exactly so you know if they're not part of the ... he he's not some as a writer and he's not some Steve Bannon insurgent and the judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment\nA Supreme Court nominee from central casting and ... and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service\nAnd the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's so real is Asian from\n... from ... I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and don't wipe or the Republican Party is going where they realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case to court judge yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nBut it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never ... never never got about ... we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political high dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on one particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults will see that with ...\n[laughter] [laughter] I mean we don't really know for air as I have read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these number Trump or is going on\nAnd many of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people that I Know that are never Trump hers but all the sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\n[laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talk about the Republican Party [laughter] or or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the ... the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to the point of the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh ... who was it uh I'm trying to think of the the the the person oh oh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nI I thought this would because I I Know I saw that the uh Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro\nThe uh Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that I saw it on social media and a lot of people furious excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now about except for Bill Kristol a and\nAnd uh it was at a Jonathan as it ... they're at a use it on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives\nThat what came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after the the the house report the house GOP report the eight hundred page report on Ben guys\nYeah so I I think that's you know what's happening so again uh you look at that and you say wow liberal super Republicans then I see that Washington Examiner\nOr which is eight for anybody to know a very conservative outlet GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending sooner mommy\nFive weeks before the critical mid term elections House Republicans are outgunned and out man as a constellation of well sourced

making a claim\nAnd and the problem is is that the ... claim they can't find anything to back it up the left screens for an FBI investigation well that wasn't going to happen but it's a supplemental background check the president agreed to that\nYou know I was watching a Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the um press conference on Wednesday you know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking you know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question from a female reporter well\nWhy is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse in the Catholic Church\nAnd those those who were claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers or wait a minute he\nHe's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process so his comments or the rally or were factual based but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims\nYou know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left at once again has created their own little fantasy that these are credible claims but sorry in this setting they're not if you can't find anyone to back it up\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nLooking to purchase your

smart helping you run more efficiently as straight liners number one goal a so there's a where we are cloture vote on a friday the Senate all members of the Senate will be able to see it yeah and that's a statement\nYou and I were looking for an update to the story a little while ago and we did that during this past break and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity to review the report\n... over the next couple of bright as we go back and you know because the the cloture vote could happen you know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday a and I suspected that well while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\n'em that he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction\nA you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and making you know take their time with him\nUm and and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either and one large group or or smaller groups even a in order to to see everything\n[noise] uh we had seen the story of late yesterday that the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump campaign uh and that's a Fox News headlines from uh yesterday was going through additional\nMaterials here in the last hour and saw the hill dot com and John Solomon\nOf who I Believe was with the it was a circus yeah ... yeah when when they when they released the ... they were the ones that desert or ... separate Carter right knee I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the fight the court's review in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here it is this the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nThat will live in that gray area of that rule and not necessarily and you you hit on this first a little while ago few minutes ago\nBut but really I mean the approach would likely be because I could see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable I don't know what the punishment is um but certainly\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate there's a lot of close races and there's no one\nYou're talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that is going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be that it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday well there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough that the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people ah they didn't talk to Ford\nOr Kavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated tube so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to plug it go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the uh Republicans most likely want to abide by the rules that Democrats\nWill do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff perks and not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about uh the whole of Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bombshell\nA out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which Pamela was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got a warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI if they show\nA at that time which without question shows the politics played a part and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I asked questions over a year and a half ago is\nThis where this is going to we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked about where this were what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question that\nHas come true it ... it has all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power\nUnder the previous administration that that uh a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a very Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for bats are Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam shift as do Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and not feeling the Democrats are the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so that they won't release it and they know the Republican\nRelease it so they won't release or do they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans you know if you are in the in the Senate wants to keep\nA bitch rule and the fact that hey we can't be black but not every background check we do of every of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ... I really think that\nYou may see that much had right to you we go to markets in Virginia Marcus welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHow're you doing [laughter] hey I just what you say an Adam Schiff should be investigated I think he spent a leak do time you may you know\nThat I Know yes I mean well I don't know if you ask but right we all believe yes\nI mean when I was I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother in law everybody ... they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democrat Party yeah yeah\nI can I don't think it's going to last I mean they they uh\nOverplay their hand while they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind markers and and and thank you for the call we all share is a\nBig big old there hey I got two kids in college and fake socialism the greatest thing in the world\nWell sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is or what the causes\nThe party the protestors the far left now leads the party they leave the media they're very active in the media they are part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former CNN officials or or or management including Ted Turner\nAre saying they become a CNN become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's the these the people at CNN believe they're part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change it's not going to end they're not going to they\nMay have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell you which we didn't do enough\nWhat they'll tell you is we didn't wrap it up enough\nAnd even if he's confirmed this weekend\nAnd we move on from this don't believe that they're empowered because they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate\nTrump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to\nBe around it but on the the other side they're going to know\nA that they're in they're in trouble because because at the Supreme Court at this point then you have\nA a a fight for maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction of stores they call it conservative which would I think is missing labeling of it but they will uh uh you know it's going to it they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there is going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty\nBecause they know that if there is it between now in twenty twenty if there's a Supreme Court a seat that opens\n... we've seen how insane it's been now where the promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right [laughter] well I mean this is where they are right now so far where they go who knows but they don't they get I Can't\nI don't think they can imagine Trump being president till twenty twenty four because there's a possibility of more Supreme Court seat that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win\nOr will they just up being sanity for the next two

huge news\nAnd uh it started coming out you know yesterday afternoon that okay a there's a bombshell\nThere's a bomb shelter coming out that the top of the person or that well there's there's a there's a bombshell are coming out which shows that ... takes played a huge role in the ... warns right or the hills the first one where I've seen with this story John Solomon\nA well known he along with sir Carter was memory is correct here are the ones who broke that story for circuit dot com back in May of twenty Seventeen the Pfizer court had rebuked or the Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens or after they broke that story it really didn't go anywhere\nWe've always wondered okay where did that go to Congress do any type of oversight or over that so much his top secret when it comes to the Pfizer court that that story came out\nAnd then not much happened afterwards\nUh but that's where I really first you know got to know John Solomon some of his work he's been around you see him now on on different um\nYou know a panelist on on different shows up there but he works for the hell dot com just from the held congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers to talk\nAbout Donald Trump and the Russian collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign\nAnd the administration said okay we're not going to release this yet we're going to give it to the inspector general is because whatever unprotected information is in there\nThey must believe that the inspector general confine the corruption in the department of justice concerning the procedure over the Pfizer warns\nYeah\nYeah that's if you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that have listening for a while to the show understand where we are going well it\nIt it ultimately when you when you look at that especially with the G being given\nAll this ah on redacted information from the White House you you know that there's only one reason the inspector general exists that's to look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds\nStealing in the department of justice accounting irregularities type and pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump polluted with the Russians to act the election mhm that was the initial charge or what have we all find out and we all know now nobody's debating it\nIs it was the Democratic National Committee in the Hillary campaign the paid all offer Perkins ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin unverified\nThat they then took to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign and when that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that under fight information that they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\nAnd a number of details coming about uh you know with the Solomon a report or that broke on on Wednesday Wednesday evening\nAnd then of course you go back to the fact that a Bruce or or at the time a high ranking a official at the department of justice his wife worked for fusion GPS\nSo there are connections all over the place to this and the pattern of behavior an activity that right now points in one direction\nAnd that's political motivation plain and simple the question is what if any

head count is for the vote and I I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote\nIf they get fifty or more we got a Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well I'm curious about\nAnd it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for and the hearings by claiming that he gets kind of partition and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they do on a plane to tease elected and there's on the Supreme Court from this point forward\nThere on a plane is partisan and trying to ban that he ... himself or abstained from any\nVotes may have you with anything they want to but they don't like you\nKnow if he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can scream that\nWell they ... they great Reuters scream all day long but they'll get nowhere\nJak anywhere with it okay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know science\nNo show that judges should choose ... oh yeah well\nYou know when they lose the electro ... which way with the electro ... if they lose this then I Know that we should do away with this process we should change the way the Supreme Court justices are stupid and we should and it will be all about well I didn't go away so we changed the rules\nAre and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court [noise] yeah oh I Can't we have in some cases we're reviewing said but the judges should recused themselves\nOr I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past\nI Can't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the it got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it or or their first\nBecause if it or or there for example there are communications uh deals with the law or you know with the company and their wife works for the company right for the GOP getting at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't rule on anything that involves the Democrats because she's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any more\nYeah but you remember when they talk about uh you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister you know and it was like okay\n[laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of [laughter] well that company is indirectly working\nWith uh my brother's company and ... and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that well she's part of his family but the ... the the process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that she did on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that show was agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with a bat or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure\nOn procedural issues\nAll the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for the procedures and how you move forward with the case uh it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context\nOr they did that with Scalia um but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd ... but I I think can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great companies to make up their their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you wind up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if\nWe can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respect the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists\nFor the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because lanes\nThat door this is my point earlier about what I Believe in how the rule came about by the Senate and two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three of his secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the plane came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the Rio to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal\nJudge ship south or forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are under cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is well journalists core and then\nLearning of this this rule now it puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official thrilled to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would've never it would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to been cooperate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably the thousands of other allegation and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades and that's\nThat's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now that makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about\nProblems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even

they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nBut never conservatives which is what are the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their ... methods Republicans have figured out\nThat if the left and willfully even gleefully destroy a man as distinguished is Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it do any conservative who threatens their grip on power

planet and and they are I'm Talking about the non politicians [laughter]\nAll right and and the other the other breaking news and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years\nA this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony ah yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hilltop Tom John Solomon\nA has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six team season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee is private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... used you know they accused of the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we have gone on since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm Perkins ... law firm Perkins Kuwait who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unbearable I'd still to this day and verified in order to\nUh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump during the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy of his election\nAfter he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant\nTo spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that\nThe FBI lead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign when we got to the law firm they were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and how I Would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and leave the agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the\nCounsel for the FBI do they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations\nOf the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers\nMeeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys made it\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteenth season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay\nResearch firm fusion GPS\nWho's unpaid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a of an cooperated rod intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans\nOn the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the DNC is mainly law for them and and it was a product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed\nA Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to the ... the testimony others uh other than to say if confirmed other evidence about the contact between the ... law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often stated that said I mean it's it's mind boggling and when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah you can do a couple of seasonal\nYou could do proper more seasons and law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you can include us in the group that was first in asking there's so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing\nTrump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change does it change then to hack and or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today yes\nAnd oh by the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after I have ever and ever after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of eight legs shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just ... well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still like to say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court you everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where\nIt is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere do you think about it I didn't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the uh the uh uh you know Evan Eddie's right or a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it\nStill remains you know a note cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere ... and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we've seen of what the Democrats did which Dianne Feinstein did you know the the the fact that you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret yes\nFrom New products to the latest in regulation American tracker has what you need to know and if you're running your

morning and I'm In two thousand nine it was the Democratic controlled Senate that came up with the protocol and this new rule that what you learn in a background check stays private\nYes it is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that uh I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily applied to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI has not doing a criminal investigation I hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel\nHow a background check system for those that were in the military that had certain clearance a you know all too well or going into the military uh and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone who's who who had both parents were immigrants\nAnd so there was a there was a a a special kind of background check\nOkay

but [laughter]\nAnd he didn't use real truck but the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim\nThe reason the FBI's part of it is because they have the resources in order and the training in

[laughter] I mean if Brian does a much better than I Do it and but that's the point I mean over the years we've heard well that's a no nonsense judge on a total nonsense judge\nOkay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter] in in other news uh this from the hill dot com and this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI if they show met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign mhm\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the from used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the dos Ga\nOf cooperated man whenever we talk about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed\nA bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins who we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... uh conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use\nOf the body while you're to record Trump the interview was one of the most productive we've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said another said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI\nAbout FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public\nTheir collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the dance the fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and\nSo that is you know breaking news because what you have that you have you have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon\nTest to find the time when we worked ... there's no reason\nIf you were investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the DNC is lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet is your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talked to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why\nWhy would that be why would that be\nSo that's huge breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices there's some Bloomberg now\nOPEC largest producer is currently puppy in about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that just shy of the records set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting in every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently oversupply he said\nUh the key insight this is from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump now we've talked about this because we got\nWe we got to a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war that we beat Saudi we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know a Iran there has been a growing economy so prices have gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that were saying you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion of you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in their oilfields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nAnd I if I give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia mhm excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time ... ah and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia the OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] very back the OPEC member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nThere was no other Democrat courses or the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cuts in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax write Nolan he deserves credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there not one of the point of just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement ... um ... well it starts with to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we said look we took us a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the original tear down you know one one of the reasons that we can sort of said look\nEventually when disagreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nMexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parks rules requiring more production in North America highway or higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U.S exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these are rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production image simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we upset and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right and as we subtle along are we there's been a lot of us", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "06"}
