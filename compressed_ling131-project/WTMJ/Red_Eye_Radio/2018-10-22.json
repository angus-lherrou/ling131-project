I don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at more\nOr as investigators and partisan and we believe that\nHey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out that probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already\nThe only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to giving them money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS uh gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his\nSalacious on verified information or I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin ... so the only people that colluded it any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but\n[noise] couldn't be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that\nThey've been alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't see it\nI look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... and it's in the context the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what do they call the excitement level of Republican voters to come out which\nWould make a difference in keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right for them all our investigation at all or\nNot and see I don't know what a a a more report does the if the ... if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the mid term\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an accurate report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\n\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't tell you my hand out a report I don't they do it's it's been completely what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians\nI I just because where where would be the evidence if there's not going to be in a movement on indict if it is just to report\nA chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post I ride that you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a reporter is really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what Michael Flynn hearing and everything else of us probably will never see this ... right\n\nBecause in and that'll be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's something I noticed the landing on the last two years accusations justice\nDessert are except for the fact that you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz\nAnd we've been asking this where I still haven't seen anybody else asked what ... what we asked why would the White House sent it to the inspector general but we're talking about the\nIs the ... that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said why she sent it into the hygiene the only reason you some of the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on a story at All right\nWhen and and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify or the fight the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice\nOr send between the FBI and the department of justice rules to Twenty one different pages but uh and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies or don't want us to ah you know released it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and expedite\nWhatever that amount or yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it oh corruption and how how to our allies you know what would be our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't\nSo why are you studying at the G beers or one reason you started the idea is that you believe you because you declassified\nIt has spotted a criminal event and you know that\nAs the the role of the I. G. and because of the power that they have the gene can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get within the department of justice and the White House\nWouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and it's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war which and see what or what you can find him or which has access to every corner milk and cranny and the D.
