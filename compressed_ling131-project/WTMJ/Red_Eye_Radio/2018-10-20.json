mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states on me to do all that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nBut I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator in Florida and the rates the senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year\nAnd a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida\nAnd I really can't submit them because they are they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to what about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's near fools goals like he was from Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest\nTime although we finally won at Florida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that uh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial race is is also if he so that'll depending on who turns out you're absolutely right and\nHow many are legal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate\nI think we've been friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm content to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation there in in you know Florida or tech this but um I don't understand you know I often don't understand why\nThe only when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race just won by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and he got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own hum as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat to invest and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight it it's very hard to explain the conservative Republican positions especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are the ... on the surface if you don't explored oh that sounds like a pretty good idea\nBecause if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea in the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for a business to if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have a winning so it's a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeat ... but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about too that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know\nThat I think the overwhelming majority of American people did not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was bored with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's American people based that don't want to go through that and that's what the Democrats by the way overplayed their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what you believe we leaving that aside\nThey treated in some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way even ounce but he did want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think ... uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national for cash or the deal roads law\nAn area of low pressure will be moving

any way but of course if you pass a law ... every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was at one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing I Lived in Asia and I kept my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have a baby yeah of course I could go wrong if the baby's late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah owners mark\nYes sir hey I'm you're on a marketing doing well great\nI'm well I'm\nA recently had a had a

speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that\nEven come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant and then just totally just regard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nI guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no\nUm they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are serious the fast track to green card um and\nAnd and you know um I I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on top of my father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nWarner mark I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do but I think it's also a misnomer we do not have legal immigration we have it in Beijing going on\nAre not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of the other act\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf it was any if it was better military doing it\nWill be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIs absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America said the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues out at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to the swimming could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that up standing around with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who is visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while it was a hope we can get ... out of there\nAre God but er I was falling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the or the radio while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and um you know how to stop that\nAnd if you remember like during the uh with when we were sitting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there's some purple\nYou know you couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I'd say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter] so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over voter id\nThat the other side made money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know we're being racist were being this you know how could you do that yeah I don't know by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much here where we get to vote on the same day voting rights and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about uh you said the voter id they make such a a big gripe about how difficult it is\nAnd I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and why don't you\nOr you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting where they just take your picture and start the process of creating a voter id said you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time you could be starting a voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know you go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them and or at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting and more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was off so often evidently I Know that do but there's another point that that you didn't think that\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name is the time I Know but Pennsylvania yes or no no I'm originally you know I'm right right so you go the ... who are you oh Martha that you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever won the ... vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have to stand you have a celebrity ideas but they're not going to work have agreed that evening\nI I I tell you one one thing I did have a they went into vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a they asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot or right\nAnd uh and he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in Balad they walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nYou're going in there was a\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on you know and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're a you want to vote Republican goes uh or or Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nAren't going well scroll down version is also available at Rhodes dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker icon for any story and voila just start listening wrote the dot com\nEric hardly here for the sink Christopher truckers relief fund\nIf you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't you\nEvery year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships but with your donation to the same Christopher truckers relief fund you can help get them and their families back on the road donate today of truckers fun ... that's ... responded dot org ... today at truckers fund dot org [noise]\nWisconsin's radio station news radio WGM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI taught at President Trump prize that he accepts the Saudi explanation that Washington Post writer John ... died in a fight that the Saudi conflict and its stumble on October second the kingdom statement contradicts what Turkish officials have said that ... he was tortured and killed them dismembered by Saudi hit squad brought to stumble to assassinate him\nThere were so many questions surrounding ...\nHow did it stop me from assigned to a killing one fifty men summer many of the country and send it in a time to time pink and manage alarm in sandals our goal is just it just it and then leave suddenly\nHours off that ... and it's at the consulate there are so many questions still on that but this is a dramatic poets\nAlex Crawford with our partners at sky news ...

you've got somebody that you got you and your team out there and somebody just cold ... who's personnel on the floor so they should carry that other person out of there\nProbably are that are now my my understanding is they are\nNow they're not that kind of misunderstanding because their parent is not an American citizen they weren't\nI Know they don't have to me that to me\nI well I don't argue that you may be right but my understanding is if their child is born here that's why they're called an anchor baby and those anger babies are American citizens\nWow that's a lefty propaganda that once you to think that way that the ... the parent has to be on the sovereignty of the American government\nAnd just to give you another example for the American ... says saying does lead it's many many decades in another country and has children their children aren't automatically ... because they have to have some kind of lengths of resident said in the United states before they had yet\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have the parents don't have to have a ... as you say in France be citizens have sovereignty and some understanding if in\nAnd the colors can let us know if we're wrong but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's when you see the people come here all the time he we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital and people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI if I'm wrong Khomeini six six Ninety rent Iowa I Want to know I don't want to say something is incorrect

reform and you can reach them an eight six six Ninety red eye if you have any tax questions and we'll leave that in a but I wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cuts passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful first step or one of the things that happened was during the Reagan years we've reduced large tax rates for people individuals top rate was Seventy eight percent ... percent during World War two\nA Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took it for seven eight to twenty eight [noise] unfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards a over forty percent and uh so the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes as where the United states was a lot of the rest of the world or\nThe rest of the world started experimenting with lower business taxes or corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well in our will quite a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungary it's business tax nine percent\nWe were very fine we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around but how can we can compete you know with China and Germany and stuff like that and Ireland are lose business taxes ... percent\nA wait what thirty thirty five plus an average ... percent by state and local governments so really thirty nine on average and a Republican struck that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax ... than most of the country's law\nYeah average European has about twenty five ... better than what we used to be you know we're at thirty five they were twenty five and they would be that's when they said let's say a million dollars out of their lives I invested ... billion dollars where do I put it to invest it I said that's thirty five percent of everything and I if I put it in\nThirty five percent of everything and I\nIf I put it in Germany they sure are and we ship to that down and we're seeing a massive\nA diversion of foreign direct investment [noise] out of your it did I get a for starters I Would say a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was arranged by American companies\nOversee and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nPunished you if you brought laid back at stake elected overseas as maybe three trillion dollars that the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you if you want to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nA show ... trillion stuck overseas because our tax policy and we said you know we're not doing that anymore if you earn money United States we tax it but if your money in print French people take some of that but you got to bring up the holiday America good no doubt no doubt no penalty\nFor bringing like back how 'bout that ad that\nWe've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars by it and come back the last six months and\nApple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety million dollars of earnings overseas they brought ... billion right back and they said you know what because it's no longer had allies to move buddy from London to New York or catch a\nWave and I read all back now it's all coming back but right now where they live in London back\nBecause it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas are whereas before it ... show the money might as well are ready to be back but\nWe've seen a half to try and come back immediately and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know Germans and touch people and Brazilians making decisions are shelling that money to the United states rather overseas is really irritated their pets because we're much more competitive\nThan we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah no I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me have a couple of more questions are going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take her get our national forecast for um detracts\nI was thinking of another one of his ideas he ... he said that if this idea that they'd taken out slowly prevents revolution someone how to write a check for five thousand dollars at the end of the year or whatever it is I really do what they're saying please be an up or do you agree with that assessment\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper in my freshman year at Harvard and they like to me that they said you know this has come from a\nConversation I had with the IRS I called the phone and said they did if you didn't hold taxes out of every paycheck every two weeks\nThat we've had once a month we said send the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send a check for the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the paper is right it he said there'd be a revolution it's\nA new way I think if someone had to write you know check my little one ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nVery yeah it make it clear to actually pay\nNo let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist thanks\n... I'll tell you what you just took the words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's ... percent uh\nAcross the board it don't matter whether you're a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there with Donald seven percent you limit they every deep Doug seem that there is as far as they are with tech fuel eliminate all federal\nTax is whether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name it if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the sixteenth the bad and that in order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super\nMajority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill\nOn the president's desk for him to sign up for it be for\nIt to become a ballot or the election of on every\nTwo years if that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all registered voters in order for the taxes to the ratings and I think you know and as you just mentioned\nUh it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter\nAnd believe me when people realized how much they're paying out taxes they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't\nBelieve how much I was having to pay out taxes\nInteresting groove or what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions or in California in Nevada\nOr if you if the government wants to raise taxes state government wants to raise taxes it's a two thirds voted what section because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows the attacks in Spanish down doesn't stop it completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support or to an act and\nIt I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes uh would dramatically change our policy curious\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is have European countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff and then\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck\nA so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays at the guy who trucks goods into town pays\nA twenty percent on his ... to ... percent tax but he had little amount and there's no one place where you can avoid ah\nThe difference between the United states and Europe is Europe\nAnd has a sales tax of a national self actually value added tax which gets every level of a production or it's why\nThey have higher taxes than we do that stupid income taxes and high income taxes but you can only get so much money out of an income tax people will quit working out working around that\nHide money um when you add to that the difference in the United States Europe is but we don't have that and they do we don't have a ... some people say no no no we want to\nSweat ready income tax and have a national sales tax tax\nInstead but kind of what they promised their pans and the Japanese and the Asians and the and the Africans when they put that send overseas or it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could\nAnd I'm for bringing that income tax down towards Sarah I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax I took the exact same amount of money out of ...\nHow would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else's writing a check but everything you buy from your house chair car cheer cheer for dear close would cost more than that the taxes would be hidden in that so um\nFor that and the access would be hidden in that so um [noise] I think going to a cigarette tax income tax or and would do sing spending as it were to go to know if you got taxes down enough\nThat you could share like ten percent income tax too you know Fifteen Percent sales tax get ... plot or a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nRisk that and you really have kept protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax in ... countries had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive another part of politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right in as part of this have you know give me a this donation someone and I'll already attached to this they don't want to think solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions as as being fought on my part\nHaving taxes that are complicated allows politicians to raise money ah to protect people bit by bit where everyone's paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less happy ... to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and accountants maybe my final question for you well maybe I have two more what about the ... you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house when you think about what's going to have a tax situation [noise]\nI if I take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will do push-ups protection increases that why they still trillion dollars and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes Detroit and a half ... they want to raise them I Try and why we worship that's ... trillion dollars in taxes for a decade that they want to increase taxes deli pushing for that\nI I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they will get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want the military to get pay will only do that ... only passed a budget ...\nAh the soldiers and airmen tend to buy it if you get made action because they were they spent two years trying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I was working on 'em but Democrats\nOn the tax to show like teenage boys on a Sunday they keep asking for the same thing in different ways they just gather they get it again they keep coming back but they weren't one thing going higher taxes\nAre and they were asked that question twenty different\nWays of the green taxes it will save the planet that will be the attack is\nThat only paid the other people a day while we pack against the same tax increase and as always\nMay maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything\nOn the west I talk about it really I didn't hear that yeah yeah it\nIs here with a lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of breath proposed a tax for it more
