calling at ... at all costs relational spectacle [noise]\nAh regarding the moderate Republican in the head with the standard um go along to get along they have woken up and ah I'm wonder if this is a an analogy adult ... but uh in the same way that\nThe u._s. was not aware that they were under attack by a Islamic extremism terrorists until nine eleven\nYou know they had the ... bombing they had the uh the ... ... they weren't really woke up in aware until nine eleven happened and the same way I don't think that a lot of Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme left wing extremism is at war with conservatism until last week\nOr I don't want them to sort of not not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite them even a of a poll politically it yeah not necessarily any logically but no it's I don't think it's inflammatory what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added like an adverse so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that and and I think\nYour analogy I I think if you look at that I think also it's I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them in the center now are clearly no I mean when you have to think about this when you have a Lindsey Graham and Susan\nCollins being the ones who were the ... that really carried if if the not so much with Collins but certainly Lindsey Graham carrying the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere I can a purple states and and everywhere else\nI think you have to include Susan Collins in in that well I knew she wouldn't dare to that will be remembered though\nSpeech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't carry the way I guess Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would uh she would do that I wouldn't have seen comic I could've seen\nIf you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me of the situation coming\nI could've still seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a hike camp voting yes right mhm so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that's what's going to happen I was like oh okay I see it\nA to B a to Z I guess it was clear that that when he\nStarted making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so while he can't do it all\nBecause you have I don't know I don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is [laughter] there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it'd be impossible for all the results has got other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more of the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy if in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about\nCreating a a ... basically\nThe the ability or more and more to control pricing said keep prices low on Amazon according to ... he's the U.S the S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon\nThey do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple [noise]\nAh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier\nAnd for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nAre the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\nPerkins Cooley who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they weren't going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was part well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n[laughter]\nReally know the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine or after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of\nThe house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees Simpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nFusion fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\n\nWell then what was the lawyers say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't I don't write are are they going to ask him about a\nA who he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why brought that up\nI I don't think so what are they going to ask him up finally I was I going to ask them about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the\nAnd an associate deputy attorney general uh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice yet well yes because it because it why they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and again\nIf those are ... that that's a number of ... ride away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because you shouldn't GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with\nA you know a professionally\nPossibly with his wife and if there were were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the Mueller investigation is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know of one I don't know where there was any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money from Perkins ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level his is that's what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do up as well do what they do opposition research is self explanatory so\nOh what is he worried about what would\nThey be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell and I find the the time it was interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under oh I'll do there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... ... what is the charge\nThat lens Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee",
