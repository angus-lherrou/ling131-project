I'll be brief but I have a real problem with uh [noise]\nIt ... the Democrats as as well as the Republicans was giving the doctor so much praise and to me it was it was there was no competition to me she said she was just totally full orbit or for your case you [noise]\nUm she didn't come off as being too broad a for one thing [noise]\nI think myself when this was a fairly you know I'll be briefing you and you guys talk or you talk about it but I'm thinking she was a set up from the get go I mean and even I think it all was just happened to be the one\nI said she was on the on the road getting ready to run whatsoever with federal which would you nominate\nOh God um [noise] it's just that she was too much work and when she was she said\nShe believe a hundred per se but it was traveling All right then and there I mean [noise]\n... because she only remembers one thing you're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love ... never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible I'll\nForget about the fact that her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names and ... story but the fact is what she says for self\nWas responsible for relief you can get but it doesn't matter and that's the attitude on the left which by the way it is clear it doesn't matter because they leaked it\nNo one's even try handed a ... point and their their ... with it yeah it's a great point they're just like during the question\nOr are we now a\n... he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on a big us will ... he called for an investigation or you call them or one Yeah Yup let us go to Lee in Chapel Hill North Carolina leave welcome you're on TALK Radio Welcome highly\nCare which you and you're listening to ... ... stroll call a Ford last week says she could mumble where all happen for a full she said she couldn't remember what year it off or if I stay home right\nNow she got there how shadow that black hole\nInto oh ... ... ... that's the way\nWho are for ... ... yeah you you would have to you have that you and we'll have to weigh locate lawyer would act like\nYou would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats right as I as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to back or off when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this isn't a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through but when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know what she did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave\nStock credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't uh somebody's asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on like okay give me an answer\nYou want it look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it\nRight because it's important that there was an expectation yep\nFor a member who ... who who was it who asked to Obama to follow a quick question where was that was that ah that was here in uh in those ... wasn't oh no yeah yeah well of course would separatists okay\nOr one where you have a local reporter here ah from WFAN ATV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of\n... that is that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right that that there was actually an and this is something that has to stop\nThis ... this kind of bizarre old world respect\nThat we have politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre world verse back that a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer\nA question on an issue that is the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be gutless go way\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them and and [laughter] you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe ... the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the question I\nDon't know I Know\nAnd what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question\nSome well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just stayed it we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking all my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the\nEasy thing to do is the challenge around those answer\nAs soon as she gave that non answer I would've said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYeah like\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did late this\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least frustrate the daylights out of ... ... this is why people hate it no but you're going on with Tim Russert because\nThey knew it didn't matter which side they run they knew they were going to face tough questions or remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nThey won't come on your show any more because you demand that they\nThat they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah when you come in with look when you're at a senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House when you go on a show you know why you're going on the show ...\nThey'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my step around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's what is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody going to finally say a you're not answering my question what's your answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities any more think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the manger personalities on the major political personalities who run and drive this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no his face the other way [laughter] meet the press that was pressed the meat that we're going to do a handshake\nThat's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm we there\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI might as\nWell be giving that answer to every question your mom [laughter] what do you think that your mom\n[laughter] [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it why not just make it I have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of\nGrade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble\nThe words actually you got to make up a word nothing can be a real war word\nAnd you got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board and as long as you just use it for more [laughter] okay [laughter] so that's what I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is exactly nobody's taking a the there\nTheir constituents are seriously in the case of a Jeff like he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer I don't know I don't know who like yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an oil [laughter] ah\nBecause various or not or act very observant yeah yes and it's not\nDemocrats you might think\nMr coups and all of you may think that Jeff Flake is a hero I'll say what I said earlier friday has a long ways away Trump just got back into the game that can often be very dangerous for
