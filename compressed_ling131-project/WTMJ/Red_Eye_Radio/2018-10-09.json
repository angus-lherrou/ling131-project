[noise]\n...\nRadio and he is Aaron hardly and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety\nOr read I one of the things I've heard over the last couple of days especially from the left the legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone ... of course that's predict right\nAh it it it is and I mean that's the ... when when you're lost for anything else to say that's that's what you say\nThe only other thing as I said I and I let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is something the Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice\nAnd I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it is not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court\nIt's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's the liberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation versus is not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation it's\nThe Serbs who wish to pass conservative legislation it's originalist construction is also than they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut saying liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication but it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a or changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process and ...\nAnd it's that simple and we need to as conservatives\nWhat's the issue for Democrats with everything that you would I discussed over the last two years I actually woke up yesterday thinking\nWhat are the Democrats have right\nWhat are they going to you besides impeachment you know what is ... you know what is the issue I think about this or we went through and and even just just before we got in the cabinet nomination it was still the mall or investigation Trump illusion you and I I I remember ah the ah\n\nThe was it the the the Thursday the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you'd better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat right right around Labor Day that was the friday headline into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even about Russian collusion do it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at you earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always used them even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care\nYeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and people that belong to a certain groups\nOr or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger ... I I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said\nAre they doing this on purpose\nDo they actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy because remember the economy and never had three percent growth the entire time with the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time same there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even in just a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you watch what's the Democrats issue what do they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nUh Louisiana ... two thousand two thousand sixty\nDemocrats try some self restraint\nAnd I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional [laughter] that was a there was right [laughter] yeah\nAh it's not certain the Democrats just want to read parts of it because I actually started laughing during a it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and push to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice Kavanaugh\nAnd the swap with Clinton Arab up positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on the his public duty is this is more\nA than a interesting irony and peach been would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nAnd make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party's taught to an act the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they won't win over Evan jello Christians are rather committed supporters but a humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve of his base\nDemocrats can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate the richest religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nDefend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions combination Europe\nIncluding waiting periods and bans on mid term abortions\nFight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyles expand access to health care without eliminating private insurance protect minority rights without condemning law enforcement\nPromote immigration while protecting the borders value multiculturalism without removing all mention of God or the tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans from hunting and defending themselves\nHave you lost me now it would be lost and me are already on his ... yeah okay\n[noise] bad not going to happen\nYeah I lost you were in a while right after we started laughing [laughter] [laughter] though to respect to the governor no um you know a number one it's not going to happen no it isn't a [laughter] and not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and then [laughter] it will never happen\nI'm no I'm\nWell it it can happen ... look we as we saw this after twenty sixteen we said this one Democrat because I find this fascinating I find the ... collection that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it and if you were election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we have to get outside of the Washington and here and bubble we we we need to we need to go into the heartland and see how people are really thinking yeah and they really said that's in twenty sixteen we have to seriously reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction\nLaid off and said yeah they've gone more insane now they've gone more authoritarian they've gone more dare I say using the F. word\nOr with a fascist mindset out there while claiming\nThat they are the anti fascists that's the most interesting point that yeah um and and\nIt's that's not going that's not going to change\nOr whether it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of mind it out what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the the far less liberals\nThose that are really I mean then they're leading the party now I mean I think after the uh capital confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now um but nonetheless what would bring them back\n\nWhat would bring them back and bring them too because you know ... which is by the way the most in same part of um I mean we can we can giggle at at a governor Jindal's you know a appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford a\nScript and his message because I Would ask both of them\nBefore we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nAs especially when they are they stuck and they can't get out of it it it just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims because which ones are not the cause of it like this is this is what that is a great while yet read for once you leave the Trump is the cause of it from stop the cause of it he's the effects\nShe believed that Trump is the cause of it Trump stop the cause of it he has the effect of it and and so tell me if you think that would change just to say for the sake of the argument you know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately and Mike Pence became president we\nWould have had a beautiful whom by our world that's right everywhere would go back where being normal we could invite Michael Moore onto the show when we would have a love fest right\nUm well [noise] case it yeah right right he's sitting in your lap not mine [laughter]\n[laughter] and\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what I'd be only full but that was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs\nSo and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's a here's the [laughter] I don't I really really do well\nOur church ... well enough that simply said they don't have they they can't handle the stress okay or not enjoyed that\nDoes that go with that yeah oh yeah that's actually one of them is actually true it was an engineering so [laughter] that's what it was so here's the question if chase it became president in tomorrow do you think it would change you know it would not know", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio",
