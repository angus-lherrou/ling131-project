talking about let's Ford or to the FBI\nUntil the FBI have hurt therapy notes from two thousand and twelve and\nNo no no no she didn't know she did she telling you well she did and I mean that's all that's all she did not want back she was holding back the notes from the therapist from the FBI\nNo no she was holding him back in the Senate not from\nThe from the Senate yes at the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there's a big difference in other words it prior to send the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWhat no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats and they and they present it and the people get to see the FBI or what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything of grumbled ... wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check they in\nFact what the FBI would deal with it would be put into the three oh two right which that the Democrats and Republicans would both have that's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI this entire equation is to give the Senate the ...\nYou're making the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be dip putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the well I agree to take it out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a ... a Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute and do do that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that would air\nForce if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and Ford's assuming force lawyers are telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after because the background check the supplemental is over\nFor cover electronics here's your forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what

requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh she even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a a to a a national media indeed if the evidence\nOr supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's the challenge is not\nRight I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the uh with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the ...\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect\nContact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono\nOther than a year communications with me and my staff member\nMy step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Lynn Tice or mark judge and Patrick Smith and a WBUR mirrors Julie sweat neck or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday\nSo it was like I said the last caller brought up was she was going to turn over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was within um when I said no it's like because our point does it go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only my senators\nWas set the only the centers when she and her goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to grasp it directly outside of the three oh two because then the\nOther members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly or\nGenerating we wait for [laughter] just release the entire Iraq or the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] I ... I thought well what the Washington Post and the wall Street Journal [noise] no I mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not only was the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that uh when was that sent here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon green a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting\nA bum please let us know your please give to us you know what you've shared with five time in her own oh\nWhoa ... yeah\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have right what what is what is that what is that one about so again\nI'm we're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas you know with the lawyers state and they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nYeah\nYeah and I ate a demand that doesn't even a demand that within a demand that would ensure\nIf you went through it that way that the know would never become public right you would never know what was in the ...\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day\nIf you want this public there's plenty of ways to do that or eight\nSix six Ninety right out let's go to Sherman in Indonesia Sherman welcome\nUrine rather Radio Welcome to the show

will be but to me that the wheel criminal and all of this because it started ... we were makes it back in July it would've been quietly handle an investigative thoroughly\nIt would have made ... ... ... and many of them are they for it with a respected Kavanaugh's reputation and they would have gotten the bottom but they can either capital would if they started nomination ... and ... why they forward would have been proved to be right\nOr not but I and Feinstein obstructed justice year and pull this last minute and she should be ... you know we're at a town on a rail for\nObstructing justice I mean it's a criminal act\nWell if you look at it as a whom who betrayed the trust\nOf of Dr Ford\nIt where they try and find it was ... it was that was the Democrats right now they're the ones that lead to to the if if if we're taking Dr Ford at her word mhm then the only people that have been trained doctor Ford or the Democrats right\nExactly and that's the biggest\nThing that's being there and it it would have already of the end I mean is it over and over getting more and more rural and I just don't understand why every American would it be up in arms over and by science I

before is probably about the seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about them and it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professional eating and and uh\nThey were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show\nRight think about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk with you hey good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage right with could not believe that somebody of color would be listening to and more so be a fan you know the ... right\n\nAnd you remember when it happened and I was like I've sort of like laughing I was like well I I Am ... this was it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system\nFor me it ... right on the personal level on ... on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're we're we're facing because the rage\nAnd bitterness I Believe it's probably still there today in this person yeah I have to do is just I Can't imagine that kind of mindset\nI have friends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them since grade school and we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics\nAnd there was no way that either of us none of us\nWould ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for

I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughters and it wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nEndorsement I think it you know it made me well there's a couple of things there because you know the ... campaign\nAs he broadens it out beyond the El Paso district where he serves ... look he's he's the king of El Paso no doubt politically\nUm the up outside of the the cartels that are operating in\nWith all due respect to the cartels [laughter] um the the whole idea though is that you got to broaden it beyond the El Paso district right I mean he can win your Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat\nUm and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you know so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas now certainly he's done better than um\nA lot of the people who jumped into different races\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott\nUm that's you know again\nHe's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you got to go well you've got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell that and that's a bit of work he's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get dumber he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas and\nHope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were basically this is who we are I guess my point is\nThat when you think about ten years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held would have been no what about the convention\nWhere we are convention ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like he was a you know the the the\nEntire stage it was set up with these Ehlers mhm and everything else where he looked like like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembered his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God like yeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading socialist candidate in the country mhm I\nRide on Obamacare we don't they don't need all that we don't we don't need about ...\nHas a Hollywood they come out and that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that a ... in inside the state it doesn't\nWork but a work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals you know we've been pouring money into the state of well into his coffers in order to beat Ted Cruz an effort to be Ted Cruz\nUm you know so you know he wants the liberal basically the liberals to but you guys stay outside of Texas look we've got our liberal places in in ... by there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we\nBroadcast prohibit but here's the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet but then the banks and I'm ... I'm getting to score yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know any\nNo no no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base\nRight they don't care right we don't uh well\nObama's yesterday's\nObama's yesterday's news well listen\nI mean I'm lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the here over the ... the point is is not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor there's the person standing next to you will have a new reason to Web victim and will need a new oppressor and it's got to be you\nHere's here's but my my again I could be wrong but here's my here's my God that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a better work here in the state of Texas I\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he liked being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to like to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his inauguration till the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this now is Obama is not a ... a president like him because you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got them in terms that Obama would be the leader we ... I didn't I was to predict that if I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or pillows she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's not seen any more now\nGoing back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was lie Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching\nThe thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was began or yeah twenty sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself\nYou know there because that was one of those\nUh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although we had started happening before that for me it was telling\nBecause you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American what does Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us\nThe left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single costs now it's no gee the rational right and it it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nLine out that's what you get with identity politics yeah because there is no there's no doubt editor there was there was no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party happy in a particular political goals this is probably the closest thing to get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions that than the party has led by them they're going

easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military by and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone

so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics and everything else so you know all that is important when you're trying to put

nonsense judge\nOr what is nonsense judge [laughter] I mean if Brian does it a much better than I Do and and but that's the point I mean over the years we were well that's a no nonsense judge\nI Want a total nonsense judge okay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter] in in other news at this from the hill got Thomas was breaking news yesterday\nAfternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official dispatches from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign mhm\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nThat suffer amused by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the dusty eight\nOf ... cooperated man whenever we talked about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed it\nUp by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... uh conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up\nWe've had and it opened up\nMany new investigative leads one source said\nSaid Baker could not answer some questions the FBI\nFBI immediate contact citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign\nThe DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because what you have that you have you have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there was no reason\nIf you were investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the DNC is lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured ward right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the source to say he said they talked it they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be I Would that be\nSo that's huge breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased group production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices there's some Bloomberg now\nOPEC largest producer was currently puppy in about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set in\nNovember of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insight this is from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump\nNow we've talked about this 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said the United states now we know we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we'd have every other country and somebody called up and they said well been outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil\nThat's money that stays here well and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nBut I just I give credit here to President Trump or he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding with your military were were there for you all the time ... ah and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] they'll back in the field that member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we've talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we've talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um but ... stops what could be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we've had this long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] ... babies\nOne of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know ... one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who's leading the columnist for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concessions on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers and potential terrorists\nIf its exports to the U.S exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talk to just Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive\nSaid some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and even though the name has been changed by and as we settle on a we there's been a lot of us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "07"}
