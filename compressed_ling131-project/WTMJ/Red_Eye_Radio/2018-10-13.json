T. M. J. as we welcome you into a brand new day it is officially Saturday\nAs it's twelve o four in the morning\nWe're going to continue talking brewers baseball for quite some time\nWe get back to the phone calls in just a moment for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine one six twenty of the academic mortgage ... but first off just a little bit ago\nI got the chance to talk with the person we were just talking about that is a brand new wardrobe first thing I asked them could it be ever ate his wildest imagination ever imagined hitting a home run\nIn the end of the U.S off of the future hall of famer Clayton saw\nNever never ever um you know\nComing off the bat is just one of those where\nYou're just trying to make the picture work you know as a when you're pitching against and you're going against the French or do you want to put them away as quick as possible and I was just trying to go up there and see a couple of ... and then hopefully you know trying to work at the count and\nYou know I was just trying to put the ball and playing and thankfully you know a good one on it and was able to get it out\nTake me through the motions for the moment it comes off your fat to the moment you realize it's gone\nYeah it's a I knew I had a good but you never know you just you and make sure and I think\nYou know once once around at first I kind of saw villains are kind of pull ups are on you I got it and went up those first it was just kind of like\nI'm just kinda kinda blacked out a little bit and you just showed some emotion there and uh you know what all that out and some of the guys are saying that when I was round the first of all most of it out it was the second baseman place before I even finish second so uh don't remember that really but you know it was a goal moment\nHey it in a one run games you can say you at the game winner right I guess so yeah that's right about you're pitching to any for strike out and don't give up ahead to do that on this kind of state\nSo you as a game winner right I guess so yeah that's right you're pitching to any force strike outs and don't give up ahead to do that on this side of said what does it mean for you\nUm it's huge you know it gives a lot of confidence is just going for in a you know just being able to go out there and and and keep the same game as you\nDid you ever see a good idea that you would come in and the third inning or what what was communicated with you about that before the game um I was just sold\nTo be ready you know be read it in ... and um you know I think this past month or month and a half or so you know it's as was meant for the bullpen and [noise]\nAnd um you know so so convinced one I was\nReady to go whenever they called and um you know just so happened that they call them second anything and I was ready to go frantic congratulations thank you so much for talking All right thank you for\nYour own brewers extra innings just a little while ago we'll get back to the phones for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four ... four seven nine nine one six twenty it is the academic mortgage talk in tax line\nYou can also a tweet and if you would like a map Polly on air on Twitter and the phone number you can call in or you can text in well I take a caller we got mad who's in downtown Milwaukee Hey Matt you're on WGM Jay\nPay you for taking my call 'em out as if we can talk about maybe some of the different strategies for the longevity of some of our pitchers and you know we uh we were using you know a lot of our bullpen and specifically hater going I think forty six pictures\nJust drive you counsel to stretch out our guys a little bit more\nI appreciate the call and he talked about what we'll hear from them and just a while they wait as hater was going along today once he threw that second inning they knew he was down tomorrow so at that point they made the decision\nOkay let's see how far you can take cater today\nBecause you're not going to have him for a couple of days no matter what with hater there is not a lot of difference between them throwing say twenty five pitches and forty five pitches he's\nGoing to be down a minimum of two days no matter what so we're not going to see just hate her tomorrow we're not gonna see Brandon would dress tomorrow outside of that I Do think absolutely everybody's going to be available at the un cs\nAt this point your every when matters every day your plane to try to get into the world series so great council utilizes bullpen today in a way that\nUh he he did what he had to do to make sure that this team came away with the wind let's go to mail in Milwaukee have melt thanks for calling year on WGM Jay\n... you're on the air now you got to turn your radio down\nI was very good game and I want to\nListen to see my handler sweating I mean I Want to win that game\nWhere you get your picture say I mean everybody coming in doing their jobs just roll roll through how proud of you of the job that your pictures of today\nIs on the on the credit for those feature throw them over me I'm behind the play I give you some of them don't care if we can they give a commendable very one sided in science and the raking Lewis\nDoesn't know how to use them as\nThree innings and forty six pitchers Josh hatred it surprised you know say a that's a crime left them in that long\nHours for permanent over there and I was eating the sheep I I'm I Know what you're going to be\nA very good for free and then when the first reason for\n... for after you came out of the game or aircraft supposed to talk of the umpire for mom so bad to happen even got thrown out who's uh who's the emergency cats are ... who would catch at that point [noise]\nI don't know I I I don't know every now and he can catch a fee for images of the games stuff decision for because they feed off of\nManic resolutions on the way they will suck you're getting real soon I think as\nMany pain you're joining us just a little while ago here on brewers extra innings for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that's the ac unit mortgage talk and tax on have somebody at ... asking the question said if we're if we're excuse me if\nA if a brand new ... dress was pitching so well and the brewers have a five one lead why not let him throat to more innings only use hater one inning\nAnd my answer is because that wasn't the plane\nYou know they go into this these games\nHaving a plan of what they want to do and that becomes more and more clear to me on pretty much in every game basis that they are going into these games and they have a plan and they stay very disciplined to that plan\nAnd it's resulting in wins is resulted in twelve straight wins they're going against common baseball logic I get it you're not used to seeing pictures used the way the brewers are using these pictures\nBut if you have an issue with it if you think it's wrong if you think they're utilizing the bullpen and using starters the wrong way\nWell it's pretty hard to have that belief\nWhen this team as one twelve straight gates\nAnd that's what's going on right now so the plan today\nWas clearly that they were but they they felt comfortable with what they got what brand new wardrobe after two innings and sometimes the results are not as important as what the plan is a prior to that a prior to that moment\nAs somebody ask you about why the trainer went out to check on Cory ... late and the contest that is a really good question obviously they saw something\nIn his delivery that they thought maybe he was a favoring something his philosophy was not down you know there's two reasons you'll see a train or go out to check on a pitcher\nAnd all of a sudden velocity dropped out of nowhere or if there's some sort of a major alteration\nAnd the delivery those are two things that can indicate some sort of injury and cable said he was fine and obviously he was able to uh he was able to get out of there in that situation let's get back to the phones at Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one six twenty\nThe accurate mortgage talking tax plan will go to ed in Milwaukee had your on WGM Jay\nGarner is that what they're talking baseball you gotta love it it's good stuff\nI mean council who gave me with the with the bullpen but I'm kind of worried about what was the Dodgers off and having\nYou know three games in LA coming up we're going to be able to hold which can hold off\nI think that third game in LA and again number five is probably the biggest challenge of the series and I appreciate the phone call\nThe the fact that you play the first five games in six days presents a challenge as very different than the LDS where you're going to on one off to on one off a one on two on one off three on creates a different challenge\nFor the national league championship series and I think they do need to be a little bit more careful about the way that they use the bullpen so what this when does today this is the key way in terms of that what this when does today is it sets up the team that well let's go worst case scenario here\nAnd I don't think what I'm about to say is going to happen but let's go to a worst case scenario because sometimes you need to protect yourself\nFor the worst case scenario let's say they lose tomorrow they go back to LA there in a situation where if they can just when once in LA um they can ... the uh there'll be in good shape to at least to get it back to Milwaukee they'll have that all day and get back to Milwaukee\nSo there is a challenge there is a challenge plane\nOff for five games in six days that the way the brewers are doing things using the bullpen that that creates Isaac tomorrow is a really key game in terms of maybe getting some extended innings from Wade Miley\n... if you can get five innings or more out of weighed Miley tomorrow I think that goes a long long way towards up protecting this team in the bullpen moving forward let's go to a J. A. J. you're on WGM Jay\n[noise]\nGame one important how do you feel and how\nI appreciate the phone call so what here's what's on the line for tomorrow\nYou when you're up to oh man you are completely in the driver's seat\nTomorrow is a huge potential when in terms of trying to win the in the ass but I Would also argue that the importance of tomorrow's game is not as much because they wanted a day for everything I just said you're in really good even if you end up splitting these first two games at home\nYou're in a position where you win one game in LA\nSaid you're in really good even if you end up splitting these first two games at home\nYou're in a position where you win one game in LA you're able to push back to Milwaukee so\nFrom unimportant standpoint I think today's wing being able to get today's when actually gives you a little bit of house money going into tomorrow's game\nI think ... is going to pitch really well tomorrow weighed Miley has been a great part of this team and a great part of this rotation I think he matches up pretty well against the Dodgers line up as well as you can it's a really good Dodgers line up\nBut I I think when Miley is going to do a pretty nice job coming up tomorrow let's go to bill in east Troy hey Bill thanks for calling your on WGM Jay\nIs a is a much to my car two quick things I think the crowd really got into a curse jobs have tonight it just seemed like it the crowd was really excited but I wanted to know about ... almost catch all the outfield it'd be okay and I didn't care to replay that abolished regarded wild\nYeah appreciate the phone call or runs a chain of ... I think he's fine he was telling folks to uh get do why he did not want to see the trainers in the first place when they were coming out there he stayed down for a while\nBut you know watching that replay and the way I saw it I don't think that that box she got into his glove\nAh but ah I get the more important thing was when he was ... when he banked up against the wall something that I was watching for I was watching his ankles\nBecause you know there's enough padding out there it's going to hurt you hit the wall but you're generally not going to get you know incredibly injured by hitting the wall what I was worried about was that when he went down\nThat maybe he twisted an ankle and I did not see any twisting of the ankle so I think he's going to be fine and there is nothing coming out of the clubhouse at this point in time that would indicate that anything other uh let's grab one more phone call before we get a break and James is in walkers shy James you're on WGM Jay\n... for taking my call hey here quick thing I Wonder if he's in pitch and great I Know they love him out of the bullpen but now we're going to seven games and you had five ... maybe and maybe we can START I I Know they use him in Colorado for three innings\nOdd but maybe the I'm getting a start because he's been pretty good he's a veteran really well on and you and black thing is there a fight cans maybe the hater tomorrow or is he completely off on it\nI Would say he's completely off limits to that question first he has this is just the second time the season he has thrown three innings and is the first time he's thrown forty six pitches so it ties the season I N innings pitched and it did exceed season high and pitches thrown\nI Do not see a scenario where he pitches tomorrow they are very concerned about his arm they want to preserve the arm they don't want to risk injury with the arm and also more importantly\nHe's somebody that his arm takes longer for to bounce back\nYou know he was a starter for so long his arm sometimes still kind of bounces back the way uh starters armed bounces back so it takes a little bit longer so I Would contend that in all likelihood you don't even want to see Josh hater tomorrow because probably his arm is not going to be in a in the best shape\nI'm you know that that'd be a great start for this team you know uh for sure but um you know outside of it or I think they're going to be they're going to go tomorrow they really are and um it got other guys that are you know more than ready to step up and get her done\nSometimes brewers team is not very good with an ad on runs today have shoes Aguilar hits home run in the seventh inning and in what turns into a one run game man how huge is that he was able to get that swing in the seventh\nDistrict run and a six five or does it turned out and you know um they're they're really important that they had more opportunities to score tonight and then you know we've seen that yet at various times throughout the season but\nYou know be able to get six runs on the board of his pitching staff you should be able to win games even though this one was closer than they wanted um you know you've got to Haitians jaguars bad going you get guys\nKeeps swinging the bats late in the ball game like that uh it just never know it especially now that we're down to the final four baseball right now it's a you know it's\nGoing to be quite a quite a run quite finish and I'm always shocked here tonight at you know if the roles are reversed tomorrow you you bet your bottom dollars are going to keep showing that back to to find out tomorrow so this is\nThis is fun it was a fun started was a long game brewers won a they took advantage of a\nHome builder crowd is great and um you know bring on game to tomorrow afternoon\nInteresting pitching match up with the engine review and Wade Miley ... you can argue that these two pitchers are the two pictures that are currently pitching the best for their respective teams\n[noise] yeah for sure and it's going to be you know because it's going to be a great actor has battle that way and uh you know I I think you know I I think my early right now is is\nIs really a becoming quite a a weapon for you know credit college so I think you know just strategically out years\nYou know a wind is quote unquote starters or that he's got you're seeing going on on Monday as well um but the fact that they've got a they've got violate kind of at their disposal of uh in able to go right back out there you know another wife to follow up geo here today I think uh you know\nI think it's going to be really interesting with them or to be sure and um you know bring it on there and bring it down\nBy Craig appreciate the time as always and we'll see out here ballpark coming up tomorrow\nAll right sounds good in that\nThere's ...

or just just how does that play out from [noise]\nYeah I mean when you know we\nSaw was\nI I thought there was a scenario kind of after Josh got three innings um\nWhere we we could avoid Corey tonight and have him available for some you know something longer tomorrow but\nAh they just didn't work out they battled back in and made a tough on us as as we expected so sad that a really good ...\nIn the

seventh a bit of a surprise a season high three innings pitched a new season I on pitches thrown at forty six\nGave up a hit in the seventh doesn't strike anybody out but gets out of it without any run scoring so we belong to the bottom of the seventh inning new picture into the ... just the Dodgers who you were in the first batter that he would face is ... have you on the one one [noise]\nTrack [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSix one Moore who they buy one lead as we move along to the aid any new pitcher into the game as the ...\nHe would give a babysitter and then get the second out on the

Dan you're on WGM Jay\n... did I just hadn't back on the great a great night it more are Iraqi last week dentistry back in ... park and just get better and better but a question about a ...\nNot sure if it got up the worrying about or how will keep putting them out there trying to keep the confidence that you're the guy had a series and they've got your stomach guy and if you are there more for his confidence banning I guess it was concerned about down the stretch\nOr is it is to turn it around and and your comment he was here to the regular theaters\nI mean I ... I'll I'll agree with you that maybe the domination that he had at times earlier this year is not completely there but I don't think he's pitching poorly do you think he's put you morally\nOh it oh I just don't know if there's a lot of a farm or people maybe spend some time studying are harder to kind of get caught up to him and that's what's happening or if it's just maybe a couple of at a stretch it in our guys are guessing right again\nYeah I I think he's fine I Do and I I look for somebody\nI understand where people were coming from because he had the parents in\nA ... year to the parents who gets Colorado and gave number one where a couple of runs a come in and\nUh they tied the game up and to me that was saw contact a he had a really dominating effort is next time out today wasn't especially great he allows some inherited runners to score he doesn't give up technically\nUh any runners but he allows some inherited runners took a score but I don't think there's any issue with German shepherds right now I think he's fine\nAnd if the game is a one run lead in the ninth inning tomorrow incorrect council hands the ball to Jeremy Jeffress I'm good with that move\nA I'm a big believer in uh you you know you dance with who you took to the to prompt the dance when everyone college and yeah there's times where if somebody's all of a sudden really struggling you don't do that I get that but I don't to me Jeremy Jefferson not crossed over into a line\nWhere you say that he's really struggling so I still\nI I give the ball to him now whether it's the eighth inning or the ninth inning you know South Korea can able in the ninth any day if Jeff first would have had a little bit of a cleaner eighth inning when he came man\nDoes he get the opportunity to go in the ninth I don't know maybe maybe not that's a really tough question for me to answer but I think that uh I I absolutely do think the German Jeff ... is still a very good pitcher and somebody that you can continue to trust\nGame too but this and I'll see as is coming up technically later on today it's going to be a three oh nine first pitch our network coverage is going to begin to thirty five and a great match stick is going to be on preview in the game beginning at noon tomorrow so we're gonna have about three hours of pre game coverage here on WGM Jay\nBitchy match up is going to be weighed Miley for the brewers during the regular season he was a five and two with a two point five seven E. R. A. it's going to be he an gym where you who gets to start for the Dodgers and the regular season he\nWas seven and three when they want to point nine seven your right and that's going to do it for this vision of brewers extra innings don't forget we're going to continue to have these expanded programs after every single postseason game look forward to talking to you\nUh if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made a the and the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with ah we we are the original tariffs babies [laughter] and then\nHave those discussions but we'll set from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that\nIt becomes well as it always is that by narrow decision and then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard that you know not one\nNot too but a total of four they're really really voting for Ted Cruz and so or time or time I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience than the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant about our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know uh uh they're they're still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together in most dead on the right ah for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to a mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know it this way out of eight them more or whether there will be a\nA ... whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people to vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his peck yeah because if you are defending his pick your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see the George W. Bush to read that called college numerous times\nUh to tell her how to a vote when you see the Collins speech\nAnd and except for yeah it's really a ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big pass but she shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with\nAnd just say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nThis forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and ah but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins\nDefending the great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh um you know you can only fight so much within your own party\nBefore you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to uh uh get done as a Republican or Republican is party right now is a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really it just made when you come when it comes to spending culturally\nUh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is than they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues right there as bad as Democrats have been in the past uh uh uh right now and you know but and and that's a shame but\nOverall when you look at it you have unity in that party as I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it\nThe fight uh from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going that perception 'cause you're still goes after them as he did others early on\nMay just think okay doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence and the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they would they said I don't know you know what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham has still be on the Sunday Morning new show St he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right you you know that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I think we're light years right now to say that this kind of momentum can get to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on data is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's their that's an anomaly\nOff and on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat\nUltimately on other and the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last two weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in a way with the electoral doubt the Democratic senators won't before they know that's it's not going to have you know it's sort of an ... but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which get will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that wall that ... that was to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... we usually moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they were able to take the house it will be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive

we'll hear from him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler said that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witnesses back again and everything else that would be interesting from witnesses especially Dr ... who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nUh and uh you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nYeah and he's on the Supreme Court to say yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it they there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it and if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's\nOnly really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated to get to the polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or\nNot ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get Republicans out or is this a because we can we we've seen it I've probably in the past I Can't think offhand up\nOf of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once it happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here in a unity\nRemember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was what\nYou know and and I don't believe this is just about capital I think it is about the fact that you have\nThe as I've said why'd I think it was Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as social is a quarter and a half a democratic but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and a unity\nComes from the fact that they've listened to a Democrat Party and the mainstream of the Democratic\nParty who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about a mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane mhm they're talking about things that are completely\nAgainst fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important just so many of us the presumption a bit of a of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nObama won I voted for two

conservative\nWhether it be Thomas lido Bork now Kavanaugh on bipartisan point it make sense [noise] uh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because how would not want to generalize McCarthyism than good and I think I can survive in South Carolina\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off of\nThat was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from the uh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through\nA on important things that that ah the matter beyond that including a legislative items and other band and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a wild a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nAh the what was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right Lindsey Graham and the big you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment\nWith you know any comment or that that counters the president the left one or do you use that and\nAnd and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the bipartisan willing to cross the Ohio Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but\nOf course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is calm the New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and he was talking about there and it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a ... has been meaning to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump side with Trump's candidate I mean I did and he doesn't\nGet what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't ... doesn't get that and\nI don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made\nFor or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham but Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger are much to a larger extent I pretty much the treatment of capital by the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the\nSigns outside look like the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said as we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any\nRational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats just said that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed\nAt all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward\nEvery single point that we have made\n\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the\nOldest going to drive them nuts and moral and correct and right and\nYou're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times your wrists Templeton Mr Bruni\n\nTalk about the actual will things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lined\nUp\nYeah I mean it is again a they\nThey just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate Canada debate so they have to step up and down through any what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well he used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute\nLoyalty is expected as we've said on the real world it's\nI like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's a that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this real people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought for Bernie can do that\nThough I can say that there are\nPlenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham that and I might in the future\nYou're are you running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what are you trying to get out of that exactly ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this because well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's for Trump we've we've set with these simple ten you know are arguments that will never\nAnd I called them simple to an arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't aren't even a pertinent to watch your disgusting right\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah you have no evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\nThat it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they\n... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect\n[laughter] trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the the the they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump but now he likes Trump\n\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety read I\nWas told to excess

Congress from his office or well congresswoman and her offices just can't remember her name at the moment more Dianne Feinstein and his or her and her staff right we want it that's only who can be and and they seem to throw the blame it her\nDirt right well and during the hearing you heard Dianne Feinstein are addressing a chairman Grassley and saying I don't ... you know basically I don't know about my staff because I haven't actually asked them directly I don't believe they did it but I have not asked them if they did\nDirectly let's go to Gary in sparks Nevada carrier on Radio Welcome to the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you could argue this um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber complaining about it\nWe were both will work I don't want to have oh whoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\n[noise] how do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one time Feinstein\nWell okay well I Know I I ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with would share this fire a as a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe than yes of course right I've I've I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree\nWith you on that and I believe that I'm not in their promise their their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge rate kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell that one ... I've followed everybody that that wasn't Republicans fault no guy\nThat was trauma you clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing\nAny of these you know without knowing which are what they get them but what does this\nBehavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen the mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've said about uh you know if you go back to ah the email thing with ah with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which wasn't enough itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would\nWould a prosecutor we said well it what matters years the court of public opinion what you're dead and ultimately she lost in November of twenty sixteen and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit mhm well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence of this happened but he said she said\nA of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right\nUh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah a anything's wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't ah when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards but almost always a party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed ... ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans ...\nKnow if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged with because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm\nAnd\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure taught me laugh when you said she said you know that that she would like to ... she would consider running against column and gives me you're willing to lie to them on big ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for every one in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you can read the law\nAnd everybody would agreement that's what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it\nThe best that we can hope for in any thing is that the truth is told and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption and now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we've we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're going to go to Michael Horowitz from like ...\n[laughter] dive into my God I miss them and I don't have to [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz inspector general you and I said we have this was on the air when we went ... doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they tend to release it and and still keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right Oh yes\nAnd and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing\nThat's on them yeah\nAnd that's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency\nOn all of it the whole Russians scandal thing we've said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as it as fully transparent in the process the American people can decide\nUp because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house\nDo they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public over and over and over\nRed eye radio and our

moving very very quickly won't it down this\nThing is fast tracked a so expected to head toward a the Florida\nPanhandle over the next couple of days and then moving up over south and North Carolina and then back out over water according to the current track and are they just updated that\nA little while ago or so or they could it could have wins somewhere in the eighty mile an hour range of of the time it makes landfall there in Florida\nA year and a couple of days and then diminishing of overland as they always do they expect it could be a category too though but yeah it's a well and and that's it it is right now the the forecast of course as they always do kind of change going back and forth and\nSo we'll follow it as in fact the John Will uh in our forecast is for on the trucks here's your national forecast\nAs cleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever hit the U.S\nWe are looking at again today for clear skies in the region the Florida Panhandle the big band in fact the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks pretty dry today as a big pool of Canadian air\nOr you haven't I I mean that's the process but I think he spells out in that and and also on that day a week ago last Thursday a it in his speech\nAt the hearing it was spelling out how the process had\nBeen completely bulldozed by the left and not the protesters knock the media but members of that committee the the leaders of the party\nAnd that should be motivating to every Republican I I I Believe it is but I think\nUh and and hearing or the Lindsey Graham talk about the the campaigning he'll do\nAnd some of those purple states are over the next few weeks to remind people\nThat kind of campaigning has to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on this program needs to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left is doing a ...\nYou don't have to ... you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing you demonstrated\nAs one caller said you know just like just play some of you know their antics and their own words as we've been saying for years of that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that over and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it is to this country uh\nFor about the last ... who\nI'm going to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend the\nConservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun a\nNegative ad campaign with\nWithout having to be crude or rude yourself all you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself\nYou don't have to add on\nTo anything from what we have seen the last two weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any untrue right all you have to do is to point out the truth of where now and this is very very important\nWhere the mainstream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the the polls Maine and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know but\nThe one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they looked at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God\nWhat in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness there is no sense of civility for they don't ... they don't care about it you know taking ... taking somebody and destroying their life\nAnd and I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed forests life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to ... to destroy\nA capitals life but on both sides it said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's lively destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity we just want\nTo win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play\nFair and I do think\nThat there is something here that is even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat ... which means you're going to get a lot of independents that that move in the Republican you know direction it's going to be not be because of ... okay we'll ... we'll Gorsuch and cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive in I think it's going to drive it is\nThe very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these are reasonable people\nRight and I think you look at it [laughter] got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America\nThe left may think that they're winning because the protestors are out there are gaining the attention for them and that they're they're jumping on in in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims\nThe fact of the matter is that's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss\nA claim it is in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seven\nBackground check and that Grassley gave Dr Ford her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case it also has\nA huge part of a great point there 'cause I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in ... in many of the public's mind between the protestors on the mainstream right politicians they're saying the exact same thing that\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee or using the same argument\nThey are they're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing what was the tactic being considered\nThe first day the weekend before the first day of hearing a confirmation hearings on Kavanaugh it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents things by the way we're that go nowhere\nBecause they had nothing as Democrats always do these days it wasn't about challenging him on his position on on a rosy weight or anything else it wasn't I mean it was for Republicans with sort of my or or Kagan\nYou know what do you think if the government can the government force you to buy vegetables\nAnd you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare\nBut the the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left the mainstream members of the party\nThe ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California and certainly get praised there\nBut the damage done by the kind of behavior by Hirono or ... and her words and the others on that committee and their behavior all of that\nWhere it's not about her own I can see that and get reelected in the white Kamala Harris can say whatever she wants to do and get reelected in California\nBut how did you damage anybody else that's right now on the brink of losing their election you did and we'll find out how far that went about four weeks from tomorrow\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nEngine report is
