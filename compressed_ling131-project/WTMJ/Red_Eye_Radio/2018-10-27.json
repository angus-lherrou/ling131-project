article a liberty written by liberty a better word the mega millions jackpot and why you're not being told the truth\nNot being told the truth [laughter] yes ah in an effort to create jak pots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win but at the continued to\nLie to us about the benefits of the lottery Mm about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and I stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of is her Christmas Party and there was in apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because right ... that's not\nTo to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really is right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar at all mhm\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in a real long line of about twenty five people\nTen eleven twelve years ago so like what the world's going on\nI was I was a just a I was a a mile from the ... mile north of the day of W airport one time\nAnd traffic like twelve lanes of traffic five o'clock in the afternoon I look over on\nThe median close to a line of trees a huge coyote it look more like a wolf because it was filled out it was it was a heavy set coyote just sitting there\nJust looking at traffic one wasn't a dog it was a coyote and it was just thinking to myself man it's crazy you know you've got all this wildlife like you said it's it's all spread out yeah and you know in this neighborhood here this wild animals all the time only took a coyote don't you think it's a\nCat but [laughter] we didn't work\nBut it's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said that's not a cat I said it talking about because it's the panther\n[laughter] I'm pretty sure he was hanging out [laughter] it's like okay this is sixteen\nPounds that are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the mid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story on the whole pot thing has a has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says his show he's telling was premeditated and we'll take up the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of uh uh you yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues that may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday and the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar and not worry why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect and\nHurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the terrorists slug you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this was before them if it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence vote and this is they could lose their lively\nAnd you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about that if I'm going to put them\nIn any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah and in the mid west\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming of comedy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the Internet\nAnd that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with a formula as to what's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democratic side as we spend a lot of time I and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt the Democrats and what could hurt the Republicans because there are

that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that uh has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles dating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even quote\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronic here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter is what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas\nRates bury 'em you know from you you can go just a from where I live to just ah you know several miles north and the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences\nThe model now that I bought my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm\nA yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... your your taxes are higher\nAnd lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of ... and and remember the ... the the the people that will be at that age\nUh aren't we're not talking the super rich were I hotline about what his view in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it\nWhat's their only recourse right now\nThere's still a supporter of Trump what's their recourse to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money\nDon't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's followed it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this was the one thing that made by the person that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nYou know\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax cut that we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it\nRight in the ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the\nTerrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\n\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar a worse it to the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us write the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and\nAnd Mexico that there are still in effect mhm and it's killing them is raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about poured grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier at every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or feeling it already and every dealership and every deals that moment in the steel tariffs really been affected that we're from China which has increased across from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cause and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and\nThen the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about\nA manufacturing people would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's a fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a pre sold meeting you started wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now at\nIt as a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you were trying to reach that region when you go to All right well you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry or do you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going to a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war terrifying that went into place a or anything of that if they have to make arrangements\nLot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know\nYou should go and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our lost his aura and we're ... we're we're uh we're out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took a deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty is a killer this is what we saw after the recession the problem with bailing out all the banks are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks\nBy the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand they to the end of two thousand they and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those bank so they put money in all of the golfers well then it made all the banks look risky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that then your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repair\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this election we talk a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats or a complete match\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the old you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think is very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nAnd if you're not fueling at AT T H Petra location today while you're in luck you can simply go to ... king dot com on your tablet or laptop to read a page turning version\nWould you prefer to read wrote being on your smartphone or scroll down version is also available at Rhodes king dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker icon for any story and voila just start listening road teen dot com\n[noise] man have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation eastern dot com it's fucking first news and entertainment website like Netflix\nYou can watch brand new original trucking shows and videos me just for us truckers and you won't find it anywhere else all the transportation nation dot coms trucking shows in videos or on demand so you can watch whenever you want\nTo do is sign up and start watching plus it's free that's perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now [noise]\nWisconsin's radio station news radio WGM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI taught at Caesars say our demand police they targeted a dozen outspoken critics of President Trump is in federal custody but the president has been reluctant to address any connection between say our political beliefs and his own his ABCs Sicilia Vegas\nThe president has yet to publicly say the names of any of those targeted this week not even the former president and secretary of state\n\nThe FBI says a fingerprint on an envelope melted congresswoman Maxine Waters is what led to say are arrested friday and plantation Florida ... manages a restaurant with the I used to work she says he was shamelessly bigoted gay black June\nIn a way to find a whole ...

told me about everything from both of those social issues whether you're a lawyer for your job or you're from the\nRadio all across\nAmerica eight six six Ninety run ideas are counting on Johnny ... thank you for being here this morning we uh we appreciate it as we're less than two weeks out yeah from the the the mid term election I think\nThis is going to be a a another fascinating time in in our history to see where this goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we look at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we spend a ton of time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we've we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off well they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote now the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead are\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls were always wrong that is a wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls get it right before an election\nWe have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are are ... that are affecting at a you know and another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIf if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it a a\nTrump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just calling that weren't just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back to I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know that but I have used as examples these are all women that are in\nA you know and the initially you know would not poke Republican ended because of you right right and then you and and again that's what I could I went when state right and I don't know I don't know what kind of an effect will have only knows it's not a positive effect when those things happen right you don't need to my I guess my point is\nYou don't need it seems that this president at times\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base\nIn his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think that the base has has his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing but your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him\nThat it's so much it's those people who are okay there's some good things and bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought I'd bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again in both probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but it probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit horse based was the limit was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk when ... and then you made a less of a went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base right\nAnd so there you go but a waste of your calls and comments coming up your life you know we do have a wide open eight six six Ninety\nRed eye test from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service dispatcher

Radio Welcome to the show Hi\n[noise] hello I called you a long time ago you guys are awesome bank wanting to point out\nSomething that you and your listeners probably do not think about or see the rhetoric side of it slid scouts outgoing or state and all the other things like that the younger people there are all around Eighteen a lot of them love that I talked to\nA [noise] like that are there and\nBitter bad yeah yeah we we lost we lost about half of that and we've got a bad reception there I I don't know about that I\nYou know that that that's anecdotal evidence and we're talking about influencing votes really we're talking about likely voters or the Eighteen year olds\nIn the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not so there may be something they're on social media uh uh that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at that certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're undecided during the center got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know kept that boat and that's what you're trying to do\nIt you know you don't want to you don't want to jump into something where again it's [noise] it's unnecessary it's\nIt's not a positive\nI've always uh yeah I've I've always been about getting every when you possibly can and once you have to win a accentuate the positive about when which would ban and go after Abernathy\nRight yes because ... I mean we've seen that he's a liar\nUm he's a he's an end by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that uh he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's ineffective tactic that you know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he doesn't have to call anybody name\nYour call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nAh we said look it was a couple of months ago ... from here to the mid term let's stay on course with the positives the economy is number one and then the things you want to get done but then\nYou get that you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the caravan thing you get all these other things that you know and and of course ah you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know ... Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or work or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out we're there's aren't going to work and that's something that is extremely rare in politics even with\nUh other affect the presidents of the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and by the way I Do want to um\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we should Donald Trump started this growing economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally\nA rally is a ton of positives and is not the massive group\nOf your foreign people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positive you can go after Chuck Schumer right it\nBuddy also because I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out on nothing that you've got you've got a point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller have all solve crime may not right right well that that that is then that's why I started ... if I started laughing because\n... you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to give one is we've gotten London passionate about it during the Kavanaugh hearings it's unacceptable to us and we've been blind but you're not an American\nBut if you will if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even per capita\nYou know they were both Democrats were trying to we use a lot of that in every well it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment\nThey now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American\nCivil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of caring about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody without a patriot because they believe they are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American if we want makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you reject freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject it\nAnd and do you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people's votes a shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming we believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm ... and ...\nThat's that's it from you and what they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech will know you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no the your free speech is bigger than your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to do that you need not to point out in a very one manner\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them and you can probably say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm\nBecause they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody said that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you do when you have the when the move onto the next when well again I\nGot to win for calling out a a war or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it\nAnd then went back to and he ... and the other end by the way sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling\nIs very effective liars Lanny I now I made that one up I don't know I'm\nI'm not making use of the ones I I don't want to get ... was uh what was it\nI don't know when you when you when you start when you said sure I forgot what it was just yeah I'd I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere all day like names ... no ... we said this though well now it's ... people in office it's running it's beautiful tired of that it's not like that anymore [laughter]\n\nAnd and as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr cruises farther and farther than they care [laughter]\nAs far as we know [laughter] but but look I'm we said before I bought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd the and the name of of of that was the one when I was writing an algebra and the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant and he I mean that's something that works really has a big word but that's something that's it it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not promote\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like\nBecause he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making\nYou know it's not about one man really just a recess appointment really it's not about one man Mr I don't need Congress to get things past Mr recess appointment down down nine nothing yeah ... ...

review and all across\nAmerica eight six six Ninety red ideas or hunting and I'm very McNamara welcome and good morning America as we went through all the minutia of all the different issues what [noise] you know my possibly of of affect somebody's votes you know going out for the midterm I started looking at the just just the big picture overall you know with\nAbout the ah they'd be excitable turn out that you know ... that's what they talking about the excited voter out there on both sides and who's the motivated excited voter who wants to go out and vote\nNot doesn't mean it's a positive excitement it can be an angry excitement and if so if you look at the big picture out there or the Democrats that hey Trump\nNow could they hate him any more\nThan they did or the\nDay before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is he is the anger ... still there to motivate the Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know we talked about this this president is up I every president has unique and\nEvery Republican president we forget because people said nobody's ever been in fact like Donald Trump before\nWe forget that Bush was called the ... the only thing is the difference between a Bush and they don't Trump is or should never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase [noise] but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad if you're\n... ... ... remember the protest outages ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas ... it was everything they were hanging of an effigy they read everything he was Hitler he was a ... and as Bill Maher said\nWell yeah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we call them Hitler but they really weren't but Trump is they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is either that\nThis is why I think we can't underestimate\nYou know the the silent majority or whatever you want to call I don't think you can call this race and say you know uh overstep the houses definitely go to will go to the Democrats I don't make productions\nBut there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've rented a wellness center was set and and the thing is as I mentioned earlier\nThe danger of Trump's exhaustion was blown out of the water because of capital right\nRight and is it is as it is it's ... fire right on like how energize yeah is there are are the Republicans here because I never\nIn in that time period that that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks but I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much a back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time\nI Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as your night it when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people\nOver Kavanaugh back to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it could be if it actually is that\nI think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right right yeah\nUm and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know ... ... if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west or just to

Berkeley had assigned and not on healthcare but on border control\nThey would say no people should be able to come and go as they please because if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it and this was the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage\nI Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say at every route they want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\n... ... ... and this device I'd get to the president is president people already know what you think and forget about what have you with you ... everybody's asking you about the reporters continue to ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think that illegal immigration or America thinks that illegal immigration you need to get an answer to Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean what are we lose the house and joins ... it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats\nThey force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times and the prices that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since the early ... when we had was that was that two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before when I knew it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board knows while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scam nasty um yes it was because it was two thousand eight it was\nTo find out what was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay it was one of our first well and and then\nThen it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was at the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh if you realize that the rest of America was not on board with\nA and it fell short or a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather each other on the air and that's what I say because I ... I was out here I was\nSo low I remember going you know weeks on that and uh and I was so low dose and so the the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy could day\nMight have a better chance that it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now I mean\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... capital [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it but but it's been over Thirteen\nYears that this has been a huge issue ... huge issue is that certainly would kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can't come to any type of compromise if we don't know

I'm not saying I wouldn't\nWant you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I had to get a or that it changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life\nI have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who a bat boy at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener thinks we are um but but\nThe point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to know I couldn't trust\nAnyone that do that that would be the thing because you know people that what would you do and I said my I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally in in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of phone but I Do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members or their tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I'm going to be a fulltime job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone my life is life fight right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know I Would you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I was just one dumped off it goes through a mine but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think a life it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other time allow that we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up and those are they\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really I mean it's almost like we come to work and aware that we look at the end of the show we grab our lunch pals and go home to what the feeling as it is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I've worked or just\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for so I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away mhm and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my ... because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I thinking about his death [laughter]\nRight but I got all these other things that I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of sudden I'm going to get all this money death [laughter]\nI was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it\nAh I I I don't know of all have to look it up but\nThe guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly like one point eight so he became a billionaire you know\nOvernight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had enough\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with but I did but then I talked\nTo this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was ... I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm\nYou know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem with being famously wealth or like the the\nThe the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talk about this with the president the president has that security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail or you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are ... there are threats against you all the\nMinor illnesses becomes severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver them may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship\nPossible unemployment go to truckers fund up or today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nTo learn how to go can help we encourage you to educate yourself and fears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to ... dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most rent trucking newsman\nNow every week and watch me and my co host grows as we need the only weekly news show greeter just for ... joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome rid of the week profile\nIn front of the dot com is the one you're not going to want to have them busy travel down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel by going to the dot com [noise]\nAre Wisconsin's radio station news radio WGM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI taught at a fingerprint on an envelope mail to Congress one Maxine Waters is what led the FBI to fifty six year old Caesar say arc of average or Florida arrested friday for allegedly mailing pipe bombs to several key Democrats\nAnd public figures this week Cesar ... may have been arrested here outside an auto zone in South Florida but he will stand trial twelve hundred miles away in New York\nThe case will be handled by U.S attorneys in the southern district of New York three of the fourteen devices were found in Manhattan but before say our heads north he will make his first court appearance here in federal court in Miami that will take place on Monday afternoon\nMark ... of ABC News plantation Florida\nDeborah ... manages a restaurant where say are used to work she says you were shamelessly bigoted gain black\nUm [noise]\nI think in a white supremacy ...

I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nUh you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan of slowly moving across Mexico won't be here in time for the uh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens\nThey're stopping a buck he's in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes\nUm but as we've said this is the time\nCouple of weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this is the Democrats now to the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge the Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what\nI Believe and so to the American people but you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically mhm\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plant and\nWe've talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got bad than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it like we all believe\nThat your party is the party of open borders\nThat your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say I mean he's already halfway there with this yeah you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many oh hello stick right\nThat sounds really over the last Twenty years it sounds exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly play those make the comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is depressed fact checking to make sure that\nObama really set that or they just laying low challenge depressed go after the media right say this is what they why aren't you a question about why they think what they think now what they caught then\nWhy don't you why why don't you ask them if they want to open\nBorder it's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on the debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I wouldn't be doing this with ah with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I the two the moderator I'll do my time if I can just ask ask my opponent what they believe the level of in force but at the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people and that's basically what we have now I mean some field we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no half measure in my opinion\nThere is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you know been forced right\nAnd it's about time after Thirteen Years\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy\nWhen that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge them to scare them to tell the American people and don't stop it do you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted\nTo make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue again yep\n[noise] for on the tracks here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east

going\nAh I I don't know I I I I Want to make the if I go by I really don't like to spend a lot of time so I may go as one of the most scariest things that society knows ...\nA conservative radio talk show host mhm\nI'm big enough I just show up like that and everybody's in costume you didn't show up I certainly did conservative radio talk show host now the people that are holding it are conservative very conservative so I think that if I Do show up and they don't live far from me so I may show up just to do that right because I won't show up with anything I write yeah\nThe last time I think uh that was a cowboy which that is politically incorrect right now here in Texas well this was an almost required well this was in New York this is Thirty years ago I were you wearing a gun a yeah I probably\nWould have done and that that's still no that's not allowed to say that was actually probably illegal [laughter] the fake\nGun they also that as a kid I can remember going out is what would it be because we wanted to make it simple mhm I don't remember ever getting\nHad probably ... I remember putting on that one of the plastic masks with the little string but\nI I don't remember what the what are the only thing I remember wanting to be is again remember a hobo\nMhm you just take the stake in the little thing and you put them behind and yet ... put sharp both charcoal on your face but right was it was is that politically incorrect you can't use charcoal well it was to make it was if you had like a beard right get like you had to be here like if I like uh like it was five days growth as if\nYou know they shave every five days [laughter] except exam on but now that politically incorrect you can't go as as a no\nAid temporarily displaced or maybe permanently displaced Traveller\n[laughter]\nAway word or what about the the you know typically what I see at at my door on a on Halloween is that these days is superhero\nYou know or the the you know the little girls will wear like a you know like a butterfly costume that's actually one of my granddaughters is going and she's got this really cool butterfly costume that she is going is about\nMy my grandson's going as a um a pumpkin his dad and I are trying to make it an evil pumpkin but his mom was fighting me on that\nSo she just wants a regular pumpkin ... is a next Wednesday that or is it\nYeah yeah yeah well that I've I've got to go to sleep all my lights nobody bought it in my neighborhood you turn the lights off nobody bothers\nMe I knew that I Would have ever that energy and and I was a code\nI mean I I Love every ... if uh the Halloween wound up once every uh four to five or five years and I'm On the friday and Saturday Night I stay home I Love it\nAnd I and I saw now some towel friday night because of ... right and wanting to announce she's so that you write that blows that Sonia one mhm\nUh but I I Love it and I am I absolutely love I've got grandkids so now so it's just this great the you know the kids ... and the kids on especially in the weekend they come to the doors and they'll come until ten o'clock at night and and I just love it\nBut I did see the stories where some towns are threatening to rest the teenagers to just see that who who tricking treat or trick or treat like an age limit you have to be an age limit that's you can't do that sorry and and I'm thinking\nI I don't care if the older kids come to my dad and I I really don't care I don't hear all of a sudden you'll you open the door especially like at nine nine thirty it a little bit later it's a bunch of high school kids\nYeah I think that's fantastic yeah yeah my neighbor Bob came over he's eighty six I gave him [laughter]\nHe was dressed and I hope that at\nEvery year it's like the neighbors get to get hired who's running out of candy and you got it all I got to bail out while I ever running out of candy I I I get but I mean I always buy weight while I don't even end up closing the door I end up sitting out on the porch and the neighbors come over and it's just a great time and I don't carry you'll have you'll you'll have in the high school kids come out a little bit later and\nAnd but everybody is done by nine thirty ten\nWe um we we we kind of have a it depends\nOn you know again if it's a weekend or not my granddaughter's\nOr we'll go to you know we'll go to their house and walk with them in the neighborhood sometimes I it just depends on what they're doing you know they're getting older now my oldest granddaughter is Thirteen\nSo you know I'm I'm not even sure she's going to want to go trick or treating I have no idea they love dressing up though I mean they're they have a lot of fun doing it well it but but then we come home and then you know it's it's like whatever time it is if it's not too late and then we hand out candy so changes when you have grandkids\nWell you know it's like when when uh we've we've talked about this before when well you know seven or eight year olds and defining their sexuality and we're like excuse me when I was eight years old the only thing I cared about was candy I did hear the Seinfeld bent on candy just a couple of weeks ago and then\nAnd that was my life my life revolved around candy ... and I didn't care about the Halloween costume\nRain we'd go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we'd go read co op too I we we we've had Fifteen blocks I come home with grocery bags of candy and even at that age and all I cared about was the candy costume could care less yeah socializing could care less ... get me that can be\nYeah right so of course that's my that's that's my tendency now we used to take a and it's now is you know the high blood sugar I've got to stay away from candy penance for being evil as we would use pillow cases [laughter] and I grew up poor because they were\nBigger [laughter] no they they were stronger yeah they could hold [laughter] that's right yeah I never ...\nI still do I do something like that I had a hello can build with candy it's much\nMuch about a benefit if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity I'd be going out today I'd be out yeah every Halloween [laughter] bag huge back I'd that pillows and that's a good idea yeah yeah it's it's it's\nRemember one time when my son but he was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen and he and his buddies or had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and they we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm is really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go\nIs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases down in the driveway we're about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water came out and they were gone\nAnd the boys were just so disappointed that was my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king sized pillow cases and we didn't walk we drove I said we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys tell\nMe [laughter] we've all those locations that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever\nAsked by we had a very much like mine didn't wait yes well I I was just you know of wondering now can you where\nIs it is it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom asks are outnumbered than the George W mass route during that time well Iran resident automatically mean you're probably still seeing Nixon mask yeah but I mean I have not seen a ... you know with the one mask I\nI don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask [noise] I don't think I ever saw one\nHas ever Reagan mess you know given that it was ... there was Carter you know because of the big ...\nRemember that [laughter] I don't think there was a general\nMatter just for him and they shouldn't ah why are we discriminating against ... of every Monday and all that long time ago now I don't remember the next ... everybody remembers the next ...
