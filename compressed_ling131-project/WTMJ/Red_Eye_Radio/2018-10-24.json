I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie ... just plays of Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the\nBank it would it would a high there would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm\nI'm not I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I have a a\nA friend who uh a friend or family member who a bad boy at one time was working for a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day ...\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy out a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are um but but the point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but\nBut still you've got so much going on managing your wealth is more than ... and I also have a full time job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though\nTo know I couldn't have lost anyone that do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred billion dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nHe exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the Denver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job perjuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it all away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is gonna be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I like his life fight right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nYeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I ...
