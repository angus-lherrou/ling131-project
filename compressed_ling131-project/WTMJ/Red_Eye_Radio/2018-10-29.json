Republican and uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and haven't ones by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question well\nYou know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the ghetto part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nBut we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh yeah I agree with you you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know uh there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened to be our and see if the convention in the summer and twenty sixteen yeah but without the age but now he's beautiful debt yes right well because now he's useful\nBut if you decided to challenge the president pointed out within twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger I'm Better problems that are not going to jail to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but it it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement\nAnd now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me\nEven though the president is with him in Houston I'm not I mean I I think you would probably again which sucks I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other\nAnd it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixty\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes are avid but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate\nMhm yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the lessons considered that in fact have been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with or her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff's department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and the end and those that probably has\nSome to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what where it comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\n... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers\nConducting thorough pre prep inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during her next pre or post tripping section checked to make sure your fifth\nWheel securely attached and free of any excess of where the trainer king pin must be watched properly in the jaws of the\nFifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly PA truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre\nOr post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shock\n[noise] bucks more readily radio with a record ...

Bush and John McCain well they weren't Hitler Hitler but\nBut definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the moment the left they really want to\nCome out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is\nThe most recent was there at the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference at the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the ... out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\n[noise]\nAnd that and that's what I Try to some other for your your your corner the finger at a phase or coke implantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that one I allow you to think as you really think\nBecause when when you're talking about folks about the the homosexual affair and the marriage thing or whatever if you talk to the mission by issue as they lined up with\nMore of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed into your faking of racism racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I Wonder 'cause you know we've talked about the identity politics with the with the ... with the Democrats in and the identity politics that have really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country and laws must ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I start thinking about that and wonder how many cars we said this we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jump to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there saying wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ...\nA lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this has time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenges so what does this fight band for a week yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender ism there's also a trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights are\nProtected groups created under the civil rights act\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups then the civil rights and there and just done as friends over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era\nThat happened there Ole that entire battle it's we're not [noise]\nAnd not only that you know the um the civil war was for nothing new fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental officials there though why did we fight you know just to say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on a lot of different paths now so I'm like no\nWe are America this with America when I say that we're as individuals better than anybody or any of the country where say our ideas are better than everybody else in or out of the country\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they\nThey don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the less throws at the conservatives enough to write that you ... you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what her how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was and\nI don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the the democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can of a system with but he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with him about it and he died before I got to ask him but I said would ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but\nWhen you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about\nAnd then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe a woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be a must leave the white man over the black you\nKnow all over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I found incredible the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\nWill know what I talk to black man about a bad situation they fully understand\nThat the uh 'cause I don't know if you remember it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlackmail that within the city you know came up under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away right also\nSunlight now you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against control for which\n...\nFrames a thank you so much a Sandy some reshaped writes thoughts and uh\nYeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me I'm a conservative and live my life\nWell you know it's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the free of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there\nIs a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign and another ...\nThat's a cruise sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative but I haven't had a chance to ask him as anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs\nYou know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side we're the big street it and so I don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's\nHe's always working in the yard I you know I I think the\nOf a\nGroup that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit mhm and the responses that you've got to the media coverage of it\nAnd James like our our last caller and this is striking fear much saying there's a monumental change in in a black going to vote Republican but they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage the left\nCannot permit that they must demonize every single person who would tend to do that because you're talking about a solid
