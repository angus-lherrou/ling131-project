storm or not we can interact with still strengthening I mean this is the real deal to run a drill a this is going to comment hard it's going to come and powerful and you do not want to be on the immediate coast find in a building\nA that's a storm chaser Mike these in Panama City\nAnd that report there are two of what's on Westwood One the news\nYou know you watch the storm and and and look at how the storm is strengthen over well just over the last twenty four hours really um but from the weekend where are some were predicting a category somewhere between the category one possibly a two and then by Monday morning\nUh it uh with uh with that report early Monday started to change and they were saying possibly a three now officially a category for hurricane Michael is as you mentioned Gary and everything that comes with it I mean if you look at the the the winds\nUh that will be a danger to two people and take out power lines no doubt but the storm surge anywhere between nine and twelve feet or higher or the water from this storm not just from the storm surge but the rainfall that will come\nIt is going to be dangerous it is going to be life threatening and there is again no other way to say it but get out of the weight of the storm if you're in this area\nUh do everything you can to get out of the way of this storm as it continues to move inland it will dump more rain and we also have to keep in mind that will spawn tornadoes coming up here in about thirty minutes we'll get back with meteorologist Tom hale\nWho's been without a been with us through uh the morning and uh and and also did some outstanding coverage on red eye radio for Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Irma as well\nUh so we want to get back with him and find out the latest and and again go over some of the the threats are very real threats of this storm and the timeline as well um most expecting the uh\nMine as well um most expecting the eye of hurricane Michael to hit the coastline act come ashore somewhere between a three and six PM on a Wednesday afternoon\nBecause nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam ship isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the fact that\nThey did the rejection and then gave it to the inspector General Dempsey classified it and then said oh we see something here that the inspector general who investigate\nCorruption mhm we give it to him to review it\nBecause there's only ... whether it was done for this reason or not there's only one thing that can really come of it\nAnd that is an investigation\nBy the inspector general to look over it and write a report\nOn it you would think somebody would ask the president Mr President what does the administration see in the unprotected material to give it to the inspector general who's only job is to go after corruption illegal wrongdoing and possible crimes\nBecause politically the effect of it is what it is what we said I mean 'cause I could see the scenario although we haven't been told us because nobody's talking about it or speculating about it except us\nWe speculate on CNN spends tons of times speculating on old job what the definition of a mob exactly\nWell this is something real because we know the role of the inspector general's office ... no we also know a Michael Horowitz in and and what he would do historically he's going to write that report but effectively\nPolitically it takes it out of the White House\nIt not Trump coming in and you know having a a a press conference saying a week or Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying we found wrongdoing by these people\nKnow also\nOn the on on a much deeper deep state level\nWhat is it that the Republicans have been trying to do well on for way too long now the oversight committees have been trying to get documents from the FBI right we've been trying to get this information from the FBI for a long time to stuff it was handed over to Horowitz Horowitz has access to the FBI\nAll day long anything he wants something the White House would really have to beat down the doors to get and I know that's ridiculous oversight committees haven't been able to get I Know that's ridiculous too but horror what can get it simply by walking in and accessing it\nThat's different\nAnd that means a thorough report if that's what's going on and I suspect that is me thinks things are too quiet way too quiet on

I work for a company\nThat has a group of television stations all around the country a fairly large company called grey TV and the company I work for has a TV station that's in Panama City\nAnd I'm In a in a short time from now or\nA W. J. H. G. channel seven down there and it's going to be on Wall to wall coverage [noise] uh and uh and\nThey are twenty feet I called and talked to him just a minute ago uh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level\nNow they're\nOptimistic that they won't see a storm surge um that will get up to the station right and they're also optimistic that the generators are contend the ... power generator or work in the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon\nRight um but\nObviously I tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them\nHow to after it has passed by right but I think our\nPrayers need to be with all the people\nWho are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people of a vacuum wait it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins\n[noise] um but that being said even though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's\nOver with they're going to be in there in force I Know are surrounding a Panama City they've got to I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks ah [laughter]\nAnd uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask this big because you did or you had predicted a before the last the advisory that showed that went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of of a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right\nYou expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening is gets closer to shore in this particular case um [noise] the ah the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature um the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near this and so in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area ahead of the cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and and the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the show or then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nAmy to maybe a little more than a mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachia cola and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore or this afternoon\nAnd and then they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour\nAnd so yeah and this is this is a fascinating point um you you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here are north of Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are gonna be gusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia coast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um\nAll of that area um potentially is fire up his Morehead City um is going\nTo feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of out of a Florida and crosses Georgia cross Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and Augusta a south of making and eventually\nComes up across Florence\nYeah kinda young we're looking at I'm looking at the map right here and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I didn't\nEven mentioned Virginia but yeah it goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter then\nThe Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area a are still pretty significant\nAnd I'm I'm\nWe're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England up one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains\nWow wow uh and and\nThat causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore high water areas and believed that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave you earlier right um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go oh this kind of heavy but it's cool well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road which is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something even if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know\nThousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a\nA ... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kinda bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah great point great why what often there are six\nAnd some water six and some level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of ... gallons of water on a giant entire aisle at the grocery store rolling across continuously\nEvery minute across the road what are the odds is gonna tear up that road and you think you're just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it did have that\nTo move a vehicle I mean it did have that forces you read six inches right so you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assessed possibly\nAssessed properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there's absolutely no reason to go through all high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations and heed the warnings of those local and state officials\nAnd the ... that are there in Florida and those other states that will be dealing with Michael over the next twenty four thirty six forty eight hours\nI hear as we continue our conversation with a Tom hill will do that next hour a meteorologist Tom hell's going on with us before covering a Hurricane Florence most recently and also Hurricane Irma for us\nAs well you're on red eye radio greatly appreciate your time Thomas and we're going to talk to you next hour yeah with an update yeah we do we do have and the national Hurricane Center that will come across here and just a few minutes in in about forty five minutes or so Tom will break that\nA new update down for us and tell people what exactly it means thanks so much appreciate it\nUh yeah so the latest which was one of Yemen and we know was a a a category for ... a hurricane now and we'll see whether in just a little over twelve minutes we'll get the next report in and we'll have that for you you about eight six six Ninety right I", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
