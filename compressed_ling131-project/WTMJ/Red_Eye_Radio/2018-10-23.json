interest is not getting free stuck my self interest\nIs freedom well we have the liberty of as it did and in the ... of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest a lot so\nPeople vote for their self interest all the time for other people self interest is give me free stop mhm\nThat's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe and don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about the deficit or the debt\nEither side now doesn't care about it\nIs completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo ... for both sides now\nKeeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure keeping the status quo of what we get from the government\nI Can't tell you when the banks are getting bailed out how many people called up and said they shouldn't be bailing out the banks there should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money well from somebody else and that's where this shift was\nFor them you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservator voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the end of the Bush presidency\nOr that the world was coming to Annette remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world you know because the world is coming through it\nWhite House to save the world you know because the world is coming through that\nUh but the that that a\nA fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening to say well listen you know that's going to happen then great I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect\nRight the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money throw it to me not throw bank right to throw it to me we were saying no throat which no one right\nWay and and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the hardest and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nI'm not only with the you know the breakdown of you know they won't be enough but\nThe timeline will be wrong because well

child going to be pro rated right wow because you can talk about paying off the college loans ... years later I mean even the Obamas had college loans when they went into the White House or do but if\nIf because that's something you could handle it if you did the political promise I'm just talking about promising something on I'm ... I'm not talking about funding or the reality of it I'm Talking about what I'm Talking about the the\nThe the reality of a political promise connecting with someone motivating them enough to vote for them that's all that is that's that's that's the only thing in this equation because you think about it oh wait a minute\nAh you know a a Casio courthouses is promising or Kamala Harris was promising me this on the living wage right okay that's that says or or cash to of course has the same ah will ah will will pay for college\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college loan um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation and then\nOn top of that or does that interest me if if I'm really thinking about a generation who is having fewer kids does the book or plan even resonate with them with kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I mean I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not oh wait a minute\nBy the thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need you guys and dollars a year that exact and help with raising my child now that's because\nThe idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all this all these items well no no no no no no you're you're not\nYou're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes\nRight now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo so ... Harris gets my vote because she's promise you meet exact and dollars if she gets like and how would my kid exactly want ethnic styles and now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare fail to right yeah\nSo the what you didn't get me now is handling Orton today in your ... thousand I Know I'm not having kids fifty thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the way it will give me both will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right now I Want it now and gave me now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that thing\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult but they don't care about the future they care about now see they're not thinking\nWe're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough [noise]\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on TALK Radio Welcome to the show high\n[laughter] hey great show that as Hanks I Will say that was thinking about how when you take out the cash that bombed out\nThat time that that will be so high that that you'll end up getting only twenty five percent of that\nNow and then we'll be right up that you're right [laughter] yeah [laughter] there you go\nThere were just like we were initially when we when we when we started with the program\nWe weren't going to tax it but it hadn't years into it we realized that everybody eight years from now yes everybody eight years from now will be taxed on it right and therefore nobody's going to be against it because it's a year from now so eight years old I only be upset eight years later when we actually tax that money at yes\nExactly yeah yeah thank you well we appreciate school\nIt's but but again you have to go direct you have to go with who directly to the account of\nThe the person you want a the vote from so it's got to be free college for them it's got to be a free money for you you know a Medicare for all all of it for them to you and it has to be now\nYou know you can't waste any time\nSince ... remember when they when they when they were talking about the reports of Obamacare kicking it or when they sign it rather they signed it into law and of course the rollout didn't happen what right away but you have people calling and making appointments [laughter] I Know [laughter] where's your insurance will I have a volunteer ...\nNo I don't know that still a few years in a way you know what do you mean I Want him there's that's actually me any good a few years down the other\nThe other thing you know ...
