I wouldn't have predicted that move where he would just handed over to the I G\nI wouldn't have thought of it I guess yeah but well there were some of his direction there because they were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to relieve some of our allies writer for were given to the inspector general that didn't make any sense to us for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nThere's been a big drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of even western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow rain

bigger than him and and just having incredibly now many of power but he had great balance in up to speed I don't believe the acceleration of an OJ or very Sanders and but he had the power nobody I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had bought\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average uh a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is bearing on you're you're talking about that though the the the old guy that you know they might remember the pack that\nYou know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into the substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to\nWhat he's been involved with but Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the less scared to death and Kanye West because he's smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues then Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was winning when you know he was at the award show where they\nKnow on the left no no no uh nobody was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of the country and I didn't\nWrite that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label them as insane\nIt if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't\nKnow what uh uh uh what what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now I'm [laughter]\nI'm not sure what I mean [laughter]\nAh I I really don't know ah ah\nWell I think you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you you got to go through a ... a lot of tenuous lurks go OK I understand this will not understand the sense at all why are they out I Do I have no idea what this means that get back kind of get back\nTo you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nWell not only I disagree with you if you're looking for complete and total accuracy in a song tax man\nMhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that accuracy is yeah I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me was that when they have the Ninety percent tax was nine for you and one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time\nYou know and I think the but\nIf you look at his demeanor the way ... is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to him as like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because his demeanor was calm and straight to the point\nIt wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush um it it wasn't that\nIt was something that the content of the comment really couldn't be debated by the less so what do they do\nWell to go to the labeling in the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\n\nUh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the\n... same comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts why who to do that\nWhy is the main ... why is anybody surprise that a a black man in rap mhm that's been in rap now for a couple of decades\nMhm looks overall and remember you know you're a lot of rappers view themselves as a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening all if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite us tablets meant\nThat is telling all blacks you must think light or something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more\nMale rap stars haven't come out and said well this is ridiculous\nMhm as Tanya is doing I think it's completely\nAnd totally normal that you can you say wait a minute the Democratic party has been manipulated look we get calls\n\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realize the ... now it's not the majority but it's growing mhm\nAnd obviously when that message just put out to any demographic that exists out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally got to stand up and saying you're full of it\nRight that is just naturally going to happen\nAnd that's essentially the point that Congress made on chemical you know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink\nI mean imagine Trump had said that\nIt would be done\nThat not that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically\nHuh\nIt would be over CNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it and and that's that's the thing they and and for ... it is you know it's the point ... who he's always been he's getting attention you know because\nThat's what he likes by the way I made a mistake of just you know mentioned a few uh you know running

you and I've talked about it but\nAnd we said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have

or read I we\nGo to Mary Ann in Michigan Marianne welcome you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down the number of races like his head\nIncluding perhaps a political agenda with respect to some businesses but the thing about this about our country being able to pick against everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nKnowledge horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here because then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be sued and retail doors shutting left and right in the opposite for job he would go in a massive recession if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology\nAnd and are able and change that and it is an incentive a a again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most underreported stories of the entire year ...\nIs that the United states\nIs now on an happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world\nMhm yeah [noise] um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of a ... that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason I Can't hear supporting um uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to get right\nSo the but the but you put in place all of those dynamics for a great economy and all it's working up until what the cube three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still hot and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that his policies put in place that doesn't need to be there\nWhat when and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCamera I had already agreed to that yes I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to what to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victories that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if remember two of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway\nOnly increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what was it what were the because that's the president's trying to think that the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries\nAnd because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those good too you know produce them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere well\nAnd and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry are now\nYou you talk about you know the farmers so I mean ... if you\nIf you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help farmers but when you think of\nThe role that they play and and the and the global market\nIn terms of food uh you know set up before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the world\nUm you and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd that's the because forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them\n\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably\nScrambling ... and ... of of getting things die as you said it was likely it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that China and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh\nThe supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise\nConservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well was dissolved negotiation\n\nWait he was a master negotiator why does he need to sweat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get the ...\nYeah well as I said you know ... and again in ... we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did a lot of what what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall\nWas at worst the loss of business\nWith the terrorists that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now she mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this is our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour mhm some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight or and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal so it must have been I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other thing the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his cap on what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other tariffs hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the United states was only selling six thousand to

sticking in my mind I thought to myself\nWow you know what are they trying to sell us and our we buying it\nAnd what they were trying to sell us was um if you believe in due process if you believe in the presumption of innocence if you believe that an allegation alone\nUh\nEspecially on cooperated\n... um allegations are\nAnd not only that but the witnesses it you use [laughter] don't back you up if you don't buy into that completely the allegation and you believe in due process under the law you are a rapist enabler\nThat's what they were trying to sell the American people\nWill see in a few weeks whether\nA part of America bought into what they were selling\n\nThe polls so far shows that they have not\nThe other thing is we found out that the Democrats really don't have an issue you will\nGo into different races and they will talk about some of the issues out there but overall\nIf you were to ask Americans what is the issue that the Democrats are promoting what is the specific issue when you think about this election by the way his that question but asked in a poll\n\nWhich question would that be specifically about\nWhat is the one issue that's driving you to the polls what is the one of the major issues of this election season\n\nTrump ought office besides that what would it\nUm and and I I Try and step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which is a is Thirteen ah and then there\nI have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you are very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I ask them questions about their friends you know just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for them Twitter and Facebook that even on the radar not even\nBut also how things are presented to them\nYou know one one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it and then she asked\nMe that following weekend when she was at the house but what do you think of that and I said well I don't know she goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah\nYeah she said I said she goes I don't know why they did that I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings in something that was already set\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter crank it was a ... or critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are\nBut is that next generation and we've seen it we've seen their studies that\nShow well the the generation basically behind the the the college age or college graduates now\nIs showing more critical thinking and and not that they would be conservative but if they are assessing things for what they are instead of a fantasy that the left promotes are they the future of\nBelow we talked about growing lumber who is the uh the uh uh a climate a professor that believes that yeah probably a a you know the greenhouse gases are causing global warming but I Believe that everything that's left is doing is actually doing the opposite\nHaving the opposite effect right it's actually producing them and we talked about this before but you just pointed out how they were like the way it 'cause that's the way the world is doing the opposite when you when your solutions are making the problem worse but you're signing an agreement\nTo make it better mhm that considered better than if you're actually don't sign the agreement to do things that will make it worse\nAnd you go out on your own and you do the things that will never want to get you cheaper energy and reduce greenhouse gases you're considered the devil right because you won't get along with the\nUh international community and sign an agreement all pretending to do something but if you actually do the things that you wish to do or you claim they're going to do you're actually going to do the opposite of what your original goal was well\nBecause we've been talking about it and we've been talking about for a long time to scientific community should be having

president talking about\nYou know going back to China and and ah you know just starting trade negotiations again the whole ethanol thing and you made a great point because you're talking about Larry\nSabato the though the pollster on a with a a Chuck Todd by talking about the that the Republicans looking weak in the in in the mid west and and we asked that directly has agriculture has the\nHas the agriculture industry and does that make their money off of it have they you know have they looked at the president said\nLook Republicans ... they they look and they just they were voting against the party or the president if it's true it's the bottom was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is because of the terrorists and agriculture well\nAnd and that's it uh there are I think right now if you look at the the\nFarming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration on you know giving the money is saying they would rather have the business uh that shows that\nThey believe this could be long term pain for video world law here is your forecast\nThere's been a big drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of fever in western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow rain line is set up for the early morning hours and we will see rain pushed to the east\nI don't I don't think it it I don't think it in flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to and playing the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what's it think about it who gets to this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our safety and the map\nFor the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two ... two yes\n\nBy would love to see what district that was a that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo it will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those\nUndecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and the entire thing\nAnd really me and my ... for example I mean Montana isn't just toss upstate right with test or you know up uh the last one was done not you know nine twenty two\nWhich had test her up for the one before and and uh with the march in earth three point seven ... and the one before that was test her up just to why isn't that a toss up said why is that definitely on the on the Senate race yeah right right and and ... my point is so yeah\nIt is the legitimacy of the ... the average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\n[noise] I guess historically tend to shift happened\nAh with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOut of the recent polls that were done in that race ah the the uh you know test her up by by four and the gravity is a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's
