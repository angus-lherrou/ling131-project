Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys always caution but uh but what was I don't understand why\nSome people are saying or playing the birthright executive order will go by Trump\nOr the president is stupid 'cause ... executive order clarify law ... my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author and you've got air you guys talking about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that\nThe fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people vote for a nation giving birth in our nation well\nThe the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got the SCOTUS it would be the job skills\nTo interpret that would be the opposite as it would it be as job of his lawyers to defend it but the secular border\nSell a is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual right\nIt would yeah and the actual court case so did he decorative branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now if they ... as very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] and that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge than it would it would stand and it would be the law the when well yeah 'cause that was the question gardener yesterday which I thought was a stupid question kind of president writing an executive order to change the law\nAnd and what it hold on to well yeah sure he could write an executive order for him saying it it don't many challenges and yeah then yeah but it's going to say there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never ... could be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department\nMaybe some input or ideology here to say that you know let attempt to get this at at at least for the president I I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to but but it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise to thousands sixteen\nOn controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if they've got that for I don't I I don't I don't I don't believe it ever will but but\nI still do when people say well he's just so she's just campaigning\nAn\nHour and ... why not doing this is part of the campaign promise from set up that ... that's my my that was where I don't exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI can see if you're upset saying he just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill tried to paint herself as a Republican fry just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you should complain about because she got telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats\nTrying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats were were very very moderate they've gone back to that\nDemocrats were were very very moderate they've gone\nBack to that that you should be upset about when you campaign but Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he's he got elected was illegal or immigration and immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms\nWell on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is if\nHe financed the caravan which I don't believe he did I I don't think so and therefore when this was happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMight help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on and if he's consistent in his opinion why would anybody but he'd be upset about a recall it strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans\nFor every two Americans the highest number of any country\nIn the world added to that I told you about an old old friend of mine who I saw here in the last month and when I last asked the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs do you have no she said seven cats and for dogs ...\nWhen I saw her recently I said hey how many cats you have now and she said well I have four dogs I said oh what I said what nine cats and thirty three\nThirty three cats yes\nVernor spouse actually put a extra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to none heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well but thirty three that's three cases of cat food a day\n[laughter] [laughter] I I don't know which is bad name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Belgium we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million patch heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume too the waste that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ...\nHere the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just United States now are just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we on more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable costs as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help that emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that test of wills yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWe supposed to put the dog down or\nJust after this dog not get another one I never search for tat I rescued one it rescued you let's be clear right by the way you're not the only person that sets to me this week that we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a mango as a black cat ...\nHalloween Halloween and you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bad few weeks ago and\nI had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective in it you know beeps after about ... you know yeah the tall is part of my house\nOf course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out really tested capabilities right so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I I have a ...\nIt's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days\nSo do I take down a ladder not leave the latter they've been able to buy tickets out yeah the letters there for a couple of days and I noticed in the cat black cat he's walking under the ladder felt that has good luck on that side and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good thoughts I never had before\nYes uh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets but offer similar help and emotional benefits would considerably reduced she's impacts the other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare expert to conceive that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes\nParticular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous [noise] yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nThey're so uh uh there you go the study the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking them the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah [laughter] that's actually a point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are and I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian I'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to you both of them today\n\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember this was back ten years ago I think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he has no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people ... and ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we don't want to go to I think was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere what do you do with him I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes and and I think it was one of the of the probably closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one right so what do you give it to me\n[laughter] okay what's what's your plan I they are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's our work [laughter] are you committing suicide first yeah right\nHey that'd be cool psi phi movie right it's the end of the planet we're down to what ten years just some kind of doomsday whatever\nClimate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base 'cause that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say\nYou know the\nChunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie or it would be called the day after tomorrow\nUm [laughter] let's not make it about climate change this time about whatever right but if we could whittle it down to\nOne billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this a series\nOr the period of years you know because you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out to kind of picked her up to deplete the population [laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek didn't remember how the the two forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed war then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hadn't they stop member that one yeah I don't they were they open the window when\nThere were like all these faces on the wall like rice has society had grown so much\nRight 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how they solve that\nProblem yeah I don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men pliable and two thousand six\nUh I haven't seen it was about essentially a the there was that women could not\nGive birth there was whatever happened to the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant so you had to they had to hide her\nBecause all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically as lessening not in the crazy way that the Democrats are talking far out far left liberals are talking about\nI did in the past depleting the population but just kind of a ... thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean there were ... it's it's not the it would be one of those those questions almost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh um Bruce Willis ... you know yeah it's got it's got to take one for the ... no no no that oh yeah that was proposed in", "year": "2018",
