Obama former presidents and the home of\nBill and Hillary Clinton and I asked Wisconsin attorney general Brad Sherman about you know the fact that we've seen the rhetoric rising\nIs this a byproduct of that we can't make these kind of connections yet but that that notion that idea is out there and I think if we think about how we deal with these political conversations you also have to take into account\nThe mood of the country and the attitude that spawned some of these people were frankly not of right mind and decided to take it to another level so you have to think about the noble spins in significant time during the today show talking about that I was it quickly talk about a story um\nIt's surprising when I heard it yesterday and the presidents in the words he chooses is often not care for that surprises anybody Republican or Democrat I think we all agree on that it's it's something that's\nA lot of us\nOn the Republican side conservative side we're hoping that as a as he became more comfortable in his position human realized the words have meaning words have power [noise]\nSo this is what he said it was at a rally Monday Night for a Texas Senator Ted Cruz a global is the person the ones that will do well frankly not caring about our country is so much and you know what we can't have that\nYou know they have a word is sort of became old fashioned it's called non nationalist unless they really were not supposed to use\nWhy was it important to be involved in the project well I've been out to nine eleven site and it was very moving for me and I couldn't raise my hand fast enough\nWhen you see a different site does that add some I I either influences are there and pressures how does that work when you say okay I Want to replicate or at least you bring something to light hearing ... that isn't the same in New York or Washington but also as a meaning in depth to it\nWhen I tried to do was using to monitor that you don't never forget so instead of just creating a memorial\nWe wanted to create kind of teaching center so you know they're Fifteen sixteen year olds were horn alive when this happened and it's so close to to us or me who are older but there are people that it's not so in their face or in their\nUm say you're not just consciousness as much as ours we went through it or were there when or heard about ... everybody knows where they were when it happened\nI'm teaching him how did you incorporate that into your design so what we did was I Would I Do is build a are designed a ring of of trees\nTo inside that ring there was an amphitheater um words race where people can sit and listen to someone talk about the event\nI'm In the middle of the um circle is this Pentagon shaped desk\nI'm In honor of the victims you know of that event and on top of that is where the beam is going to stand so it's going to be very dramatic as people look at whoever's speaking they don't have that being pointing at New York and it will be very dramatic\nDustin when you first started to take part in this project have you noticed anything since then what what is raise your eyebrows what have you felt how is this gone as you've gone through this process\nUm for me it was it was just the awareness I mean I've been working on this for four and a half years now and just getting out there and talking to people and uh you know young ... as you guys have said before the younger generation that did not experienced is emotionally\nI'm there all the come up and talk to us and touched the beam and you know some of us tell them that they're going to be enlisting and you know in the military um because they want because this war is continuing to go on today and they wanna they wanna help\nAnd um they don't personally my my stories that my daughter is nine years old she was actually born on nine eleven and she came home from first grade with\nA book about the terrorist attacks and that just a you know sent chills on my spine that you know because of my involvement because this is in the schools um in the community people are learning about it and they're asking questions about it and they're not easy questions to answer but at least people are talking about it and that's what's important to me\nAnd one thing we should point out to Steve ... as we raise this be one of one of the aspects that I find so important is that you'll still be able to touch it correct can actually put your hand on the beam even if in the air and for some people like tactical experience actually could help in some way as you try to comprehend what happens\nIs there's some challenges for either want to use some challenge we have something that's\nThat big and heavy to to build it in a way that's one incredibly impressive to people that come up on it would also say for all the people that are that do come upon this thing\nI think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this and the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolates from\nWe have this ring of trees that surrounds this space and making it more intimate hum\nIt you're surrounded by the state you're almost cuddled are held by it and the significance of the tree that we used that surrounded his the pear tree I'm On the site there was one survivor tree after the accident which was\nThis ornamental pair for kind of taken out of the symbolism of the rings around this whole space\nAnd then um\nAnd that again creates this kind of intimate space where you're not just out in this field and uh and we wanted to kind of have this kind of play the feeling when you're in that area\nHave you been amazed at how many different people or businesses or services have wanted to help with this just it it's amazing to me how many different aspects of the community are involved\nOh absolutely I mean when I was first asked to do this it was through a former band director to us from high school and I thought I was just coming into you know offer my professional expertise which at the time was architecture [noise]\nUm but then it quickly evolved into this a huge community project in this little town in swat skim the has this strong connection to New York\nUm but as as things started turning in as we started getting a established as a Bible and see three and as a as a legitimate organization in the eyes of the community you have a flag do landscaping that you know couldn't raise his hand fast enough\nYou have girls design group that uh for their services to help us and particularly weekly which you guys have heard about from Jerry go so earlier in the week and other community members that have offered their their income labor to help so it's really\nUh it's it's just the fabric of America that's coming together to help us build this project\nIt's got to be a great project to be involved with just the ones that the work that you do and and how that ties into the creation of this memorial to just the fact that you can take pride in something that you are you you've put your heart and soul into\nAnd and that will be viewed by people going forward long a long pass all of us being on this planet it's gotta be a great thrill\nIt's wonderful to come up with the symbolism throughout the whole site and their little things we did um for instance there was an oak tree that's\nSeven or fifty four inches from the center of the monument which is how many miles it is from ... come to New York and that is kind of and the swamp oaks is one of the folks that they used on the ...\nBecause one of the folks that they used on a platform after nine eleven memorial in New York I'm In ... oak tree is really good member remember Andrea who died uh on on that day from Costco\nAnd one of the things that I Know the government family Andrea's parents interests are often say to is that it's not just about you often it's not just about the ... family that this is so much larger than most of his big Wisconsin nine eleven memorial\nOr we want you to help we uh have so many people that are involved in this but it's not enough we need more help Steve so please if you have a couple of guys you can
