I don't have ill will towards the cubs are I think it's you know as baseball is very competitive Rockies played a great game last night\nUm they were in what three time zones in roughly a day and a

massive big screen the brewers Rockies game will sink it up with a great call above euchre Gina Miller will be their hobby there who knows who might show up dignitaries and the president will show up at such a big deal maybe maybe President Trump will show probably not\nSo look forward to that tomorrow I'm looking forward to being there and watching uh watching the game and listening to the great Bob you can make that call or before the break in and uh we ... we're we're trying to connect with eternal attorney general bread shovel\nHopefully you can join us at some point during the show they had a big release going on this morning about elderly abusing Wisconsin a schedule to come out shortly and he may be tied up with that but I'm important news for those\nMembers of our society or states are communities who are frankly are being be abused by people and that's good to see that there's some action being taken not only by the department of justice by financial institutions as well so hope to bring it up or something that news this morning\nI've been talking about the president and open up the phone lines for one for seven nine nine one six twenty second mortgage talking tax when\nThe president spoke in Mississippi yesterday I played some of that audio\nAny plus must be honest he goes after Christine Blasey Ford her lack of clarity on her testimony and I think most observers\nBeyond her testimony and I think most observers nonpartisan observers would admit that it was a little lacking on details um like a lot of these accusers\nThere's very little corroboration other than these ... which is how politics works now whenever something happens something that's that makes headlines or generate some controversy one group lines up starts a letter writing campaign\nSubmissive to media organization the other side does a sink gather signatures whatsoever together they submitted to the media and then it's kind of this war of press releases a war of signatures American public has to figure this out\nWho do you believe Christie lousy Ford or Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I've spent a lot of time looking at all the testimony had nausea really a lot of reporting on the testimony by the television coverage of the testimony\nAnd today I'm not any clear\nAlmost a week after her testimony in his testimony about what happened\nOther than it's been a lot of crazy people frankly attaching themselves to the story and yesterday I called out NBC for running an interview with Julie sweat Nick and I have a lot of respect for Kate Snow is a journalist put that interview should never have\nBeen run on NBC as part of the nightly news package or even anything else on that network\nAnd in the piece I played it for a yesterday they admitted\nThere is no cooperation of what you're saying before people she provided\nAs proof for evidence that had happened one's dead\nTo said they knew nothing about it couldn't recollect any of that and once I didn't even know Julie sweating it goes to the people that she provided and the last thing before I go to break the FBI is doing an investigation asked for by the senators Jeff Flake and center Coons asked for this\n\nIt's really not a criminal investigation it's it's really a fact finding mission and according to reports that I saw last night and early this morning this thing is wrapping up already\nBasically a few days after it started\nTo somebody asked me this morning what are you expecting to show what we might not find out 'cause it might be the reports might just go to the centers unless I mean we've seen Democratic senators play this game before they decide to release confidential information to the public now interesting\nOn this issue there's a disagreement among Democrats Dianne Feinstein senator from California does not want this public release to protect the identity of people who were were interviewed him and came forward\nOther Democratic senators and other democratic officials do want to make public so even within the Democratic party there's still a a a back and forth on whether what's the right strategy here\nAnd I set it on social media last night unless there is a bombshell announcement in his FBI reports\n\nOr an announcement of some criminal investigation which I don't think it's going to happen\nThis vote is going to move forward and the only thing that's going to getting its way\nIs about five senators who are on the fence\nAnd as I just spent a few minutes talking about earlier president didn't help last night and made made some Republicans feel better and frankly I think all of us who wants to test me understand there's a lot of holes in it\nIt didn't help him get votes and ultimately in this battle in this quest to get bread cabin on the U.S Supreme Court it's about votes\nAnd the last thing before I go to break\nIf Republican voters don't understand what's at stake in November not just in Wisconsin but nationally\nI Know I don't know what they're looking at\nThe front runners and the leaders if you believe polls and again we saw with polls didn't twenty sixteen\nOr a group of people Tammy Baldwin's

going to spend some of my show tomorrow talking about the fact that if you are listening to Democrats on economic development chew are so far off the mark they're talking about things that have no

are\nFans like good year than last continental\nOr that time of the year when you can keep the windows open and you don't have to worry about running the AC or the furnace kids are back in school and

minutes left I Want to give you credit for something you and I talk probably six months ago now and you mentioned something to me about the border and border security that I think at the time a lot of people it didn't register but I think it's starting to what I'm seeing comments from a elected officials understanding now\nIt's a it's an important consideration when you talk about border security and that's the fact that over the border with Mexico\nWe have lots and lots of dangerous drugs that eventually find their way to Wisconsin you recognize that a long time ago are you encouraged by the fact that now it seems like that part of that story is is is finally being covered in the way that it should be\nBorder security and immigration policy are two separate issues\nOr eat meat to secure the border the drugs are coming into our communities directly across our southern border they're far too unimpeded\nAnd at the same time we're sending billions of dollars back to the drug cartel south of the border and that damaging that's damaging Mexico and the other countries that are neighbors to this out this is bad for everyone to have that border security should everyone's best interests secure that and then also have a\nRational just immigration policy that recognize that we need immigrant workers as we always have America\nBand and let them in and give them some ... give them a legal status that we could have them on the books and that we don't have to keep talking about a document and it can happen document it somehow and have them part of the system above ground rather
