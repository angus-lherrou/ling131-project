Wisconsin's outstanding attorney general Brad Sherman good morning\nThe morning how are you good I wanted to just run this by you I saw yesterday to the ah some members of the house are talking about ... introducing a bill that's going to fund\nThe wall separating and protecting the border\nWith Mexico your thoughts on that announcement or I Want to ask you about the political aspect of it but the important when it comes to the issues that you have to deal with everyday on your job\nThe drugs in our community is coming from South of that border now and they're coming across far too unimpeded\nUm we're we're getting we're finding things as pound amounts when you talk about math on the feminine heroin and cocaine was back again and ... is in everything we're fighting it in marijuana cocaine methamphetamines and of course heroin\nThese are terribly dangerous drugs they're coming into our community we ... we were not going to arrest our way out of this we're not going to solve this problem just by addressing the supply but we've got to slow that supply down\nAnd and frankly make it more make these drugs more expensive because right now they're coming in so cheap that they can sell Napa funding for five dollars a hit because if he's coughing and nothing to get here\nAre we making headway in Wisconsin against against those drugs I mean I ... always tax always challenge we don't have enough resources a lot of us feel that way are we making headway in that in those are those examples you talked about we\nWe've had a whole string of great large scale busts where we're getting\nWe're getting hundreds of thousands even in some cases more than a million dollars that we see from these drug traffickers we're getting pounds of drugs were getting\nDozens of illegal guns from looking great headway on that or the more important for with what's happening on our treatment and prevention sides we've now got fifty one county in Wisconsin on two of our Native American tribes\nThat have a treatment alternative and diversion programs like drug courts up and running\nThat are changing the underlying behavior that caused the person to get involved in the criminal justice system\nThose are making a difference and they're having great success we are getting more treatment available to people\nOr the legislature has passed and by the way it is hoped legislation that's been doing so much to change the treatment playing field and things are being passed in a bipartisan almost unanimous way in our legislature it's really a place where\nThere's not enough attention paid to when people do agree in the legislature and I'm On the drug epidemic this has been a great bipartisan effort\nGetting more treatment and then prevention prevention is going to be our biggest piece of this when and that\nThat's what we're really having success were raising awareness wait we know we understand now is the state GOP um that the gateway drug insult so often are prescription medication and\nTherefore we can say that that the stepped up they've turned in over four hundred thousand pounds of unused medication since I started the drug take back programs back in March of two thousand Fifteen four hundred thousand pounds at Nineteen semi trucks\nAnd all all those drugs or judges is going to be impacted lives in a negative way that now that that won't happen\nYeah and our medical community is has reduced prescribing opioids by twenty percent in Wisconsin we've got more room to move on this but it's moving in the right direction and we're we're going to get out of it is it's going to take some more time and it's going to take everybody working together\nBut we're we're gonna we're gonna gas but I you know I just had another friend telling me on the other day son addicted to heroin and um you know that one started with the surgery sometimes they start with recreational use to broaden\nOf the challenges out there are those people who are trying to tell our young people that marijuana harmless that we should ... go ahead smoke pot no problem that's a terrible mistake marijuana remains a gateway drug not everyone who smokes marijuana moves on to heart drug\nBut virtually everyone that ends up in the harder drugs help if they got their start way back when with marijuana that was the drug but first illegal drug they become addicted to ... ...\nBecause ... to ... it is it is a\nTerrible mistake which after young people that marijuana harm\nFor talking to attorney general ... got a couple of minutes left I wanted to ship to the campaign inside you're running for reelection and when you when you're out and about in the state and I and I see you all over the place what are what are the voters telling you what is their concern when it comes to public safety\nAt the drug epidemic people are also very concerned about human trafficking um there is one of those places where the public just starting to kind of ... or or human trafficking is all about and very troubling through them\nI'm certainly nothing that I mean and heroin they're driving or driving all the crime problem I've done a round table in all setting to college where law enforcement public health and Human Services and local elected leaders and\nI'm here I heard of every single county whether it's urban in Milwaukee County for instance or Washburn county up north or brown county you name it and say this is our challenge\nAnd um we're we're doing very well to work collaboratively got everybody on in the same direction here we're making great progress\nOn we've got a lot more work to do and frankly the work we've done is why I Know I now have and this is great news for you I Know at one hundred intact\nElected sheriff and elected district attorneys that are politically endorsing\nI think the reason they're doing that is because you get to work done and I get your running against an unqualified opponent I think that's pretty obvious and the fact that you have that that kind of support indicates that the job well done so I Want to thank you for Evan\nBayh route twenty seven days and no one that only but they don't know what's wrong they don't know him from our you know what\nHe's going to do is they don't know what he stands for he's just sitting around the we we should be very frightened of someone Who's Afraid to tell the
