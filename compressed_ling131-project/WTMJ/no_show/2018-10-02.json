when you least sought the you know the parents that ... some of the day to map\nAs this line up phone production for more guys than just yellow fin Cain archaea was a brilliant day at the plate it's going to have the three ... three one way that's impressive\nYou and I did a show here from eleven to eleven thirty this morning and we said the brewers probably need to score did we take for was that the number let me throw the over under a bi okay I think you said four okay so either way\nWe both said more runs and the brewers actually scored today turned into a low scoring game where the brewers had to create some runs you don't always have to put down\nBon ... and things like that was his decision players to do small bomb to create and produce runs the brewers are able to do that today and when when the game presented itself\nAs one that was going to be a game or three four runs scored a total I think they did a really nice job of finding a way to create those run\nFor his manager Craig console post a lot of the right buttons today including\nThe opportunity to start you'll leave saw me and he picked up the wind five and two thirds along with just one earned run and want to hit it was a solo home run by Anthony result that was it for shots being it was by large out in a way from trouble ballgame long I caught up with her as manager Craig council following the game as part of the post games celebration in the clubhouse\nI mean it just doesn't really get old I Can't imagine what would you have the feeling that you might be the game again however\nYou I mean there is a bad thing that's really good possibility no man but getting back on how to play on these guys in baseball baseball is challenging baseball so we're I'm\nTowns in front of us you know we know ...\nTo start to dance and pretty good to have to come here was putting all your eggs in in today and really wanted to come out with this together in a little\nTown\nWhere you can put all your eggs and that's why we were pretty nervous about what kind of argue today so we'll eat just snapped up in a while and um we did we we didn't need to go anywhere and he got the banning and that was that was a critical part of the game as\nIt was under look but bond with Jews over the runner and ultimately them on the on the board the plane that\nSunny down here and I can't believe that I might not line up and I find it for him well against them out\nWhen we talk in March for a long conversation in the gold coin in October when you're playing baseball on your one or two in the months in advance aren't\nThat's the goal and so we're we're we're far away there I mean I guess we're we're there for that one but now we're um we got bigger things on her mind and we've got bigger challenges ahead of us and\nWe'll look forward to trying to figure out those challenges but\nThat was fun I'm so happy for the fans Wisconsin we're giving up some joy in the series there they got a a a solid week of October baseball so we're um we're going to get a bunch of more than joining us now hopefully the long run\nI Know you would have been ready to fight tomorrow leaders but it does it come burning in any way to know that you got all kinds of exhale and enjoy the celebration odd\nBeautiful it really is I mean some are officer but everybody on wind a little bit and then we'll get back after it and I'm here to everybody and lots of things in order and make good morning\nFor his manager Craig council a let's go to Paul in whitefish bay on WGM Jay how all\nThat great guys a what a blast um what what I wanted to ask is you know we've got a handful of managers that are ... very different ball and everyone take notice\nA someone I Know that doesn't watch a lot of baseball walked in the room up watching him and they said why is that the one on one side of the field they got the shift going on you got your is being brought in\nTo to pitch one batter uh it's just a very different game and you know who's doing this is transitioning more effectively than council you know he's on the forefront of this as he is he leading the charge following someone you know can we say he's\nHe's kind of moving the game in its entirety it's been a lot of fun to see him as a part of the\nYeah you know I I think you look at a handful of things stand out to me mad just baseball in the course of time\nTony La Russa was looked at as a pioneer for hitting the pitcher ace on occasion and sometimes I was ridiculed it has not caught on everywhere around the legal without Joe man do that today getting kicked out of it that they can for every night to try and set up the top of the order so it does happen in baseball still\nUh I think Joe ... is a good example of a guy who is\nYou know he's cook it up something in the lab every game and sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't well he'll bringing a lefty to face a lefty and then take that left handed pitcher and stick them in the outfield so a righty can come in the face or writing and if another Lebanese up you'll pull the left handed pitcher who's in the outfield now back to pitch used doesn't crazy things\nAnd I'm convinced that the mound to visit rule in major league baseball exist because of Joanna ... and the company in general from Bosnia was pitching coach [noise] none of what I I don't think Craig council is\nAt the forefront of unique decision making it\nBut he has an incredibly deep roster that afford them the opportunity to do that so I I Do think the world of analytic yes Craig council subscribe to it GM David Stern definitely subscribes to it\nA ... in style or philosophy\nMe most certainly see eye to eye and how things should be done\nI Do think the brewers are somewhat leading the way in terms of how they view analytics and trying to come up with\nHer prize tore sort of\nAlgorithms for lack of a better term in in the way that they look at things I mean they've got\nA baseball analytic staff that is working every single day analyzing every single aspect of the game to figure out what kind of advantage have we this is a very simplified example what\nWe have the shortstop take one step to his right instead of one step to his left one of the guys that the place what percent more often well this guy be out\nAnd they are analyzing that to the nth degree I mean it's it's kind of point this year last\nYear and I are ... ... talk about this once the the change from last year this year is this year they're actually making changes from pitched a pinch in terms of if it's a one to count to be here to to count be here\nBefore it was more about just looking at the guys in these situations I mean they are going to pitch by page trying to figure out what's the best thing they do they need to do\nAnd it is driven by analytics and yeah every once in a while a player beat the shift\nAnd I think there's a lot of people that goes all you see you know bad three players on the one side of the bag but if you're really paying attention they say so many runs a create so many more out by the way they align that offensive I enjoy what I'm saying outfielder\nI I don't know if there was a field or if you just felt like you needed a little better defense on the field um or if he was just maybe swing of the ... better than he was early in the season or at any other point when he was facing ... but certainly a decision that works\nI never think it's a bad idea to put her land or sea and because of how good he is defensively but on that same point but looking at a little bit of a different way if I Would have been surprised at all about air and on for as\nIt was that maybe he wasn't in the second base of the Post's Jonathan sculpture that I did the ... thing didn't surprise me at all but I Would have thought that President started today over scope but again it all worked out and right now we're in this period where it seems like every decision occurred councils making is really working out the right way\nTo get another note on the text by here that we know people are kind of coming in and out of the program based upon how their day operates but a note asking what was wrong with JJ we did come to find that he wasn't available I Will say that as being in the clubhouse after the game and he was one of the first players dress ready to get on the bus [noise] understand this\nGerman shepherds has had some issues with substance abuse in a in the past and uh uh champagne beer celebration in the clubhouse it's just not something he can participate in it\nOr like some of the other guys can um [noise] I I thought about having them on the during our time when I was talking to players and it it body language wise in Germany I have a great relationship but it it just didn't seem like it was the time to approach them um I don't think we know exactly what's\nLeft him unavailable today but that was the note from the real\nUnavailable for undisclosed reasons per David Stern than pro council\nNo reason to worry about the in the ass he is scheduled to be a full participant when the in the ass get started on Thursday somebody did ask him on Twitter whether or not he was doing OK and he treated packet that person just simply yes so we don't know what's going on\n'em and quite honestly sometimes it's not our business on what's going on you know we are they all have lives we don't know what's happening it might have nothing to do with baseball might have nothing to do with anything in this past it might just be something else so it is what is it it's\nGot about twenty

country\nWith mandatory service as part of the game I Believe the strong division in public life in the United states is because very few people that served\nIn elective office have any military background at all where you meet people from every walk of life and it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what your religion is what color you are it's all about the one purpose of serving our nation\nAnd I think that's part of what we're missing and understanding how much we share in common versus the differences we have\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Mike Hi Clark how you doing today\nGreat thank you you want to start investing a little bit at a time\n[noise] yeah I um when I go to a restaurant I um I always round the tip to where I guess even dollar amount just for convenience sake and\nAnd tracking and ah last week by sunset me awake through a a company that does that and\nI went under the lake and it was asking for you know checking account number and credit cards that you were using and everything and I got scared I closed it out and I didn't know it it was legitimate or or not because it is not legitimate I Need to give a shout out of\nAnd which one is it your son's using acorns\nAll acorns is the real deal oh is it say eight coins you pay if I remember a minimum twelve dollars a year to administer your account is that right\nUm I didn't get that far [laughter] [noise]\nUm it it is absolutely I okay for you to use acorns and have it as a path to start building up some money for you\nFor four years and it is it's where money that might just kind of go in the ether instead goes into an investment account at very low cost\nHerself like makes more sense and it's going to college are like I Do\nYeah and you know investing invest things for the long haul and you know in the shorter term you might put money in and lose some of that at least temporarily but\nOver time you can end up with a substantial amount of money a dollar here a dollar there through your wait three year year\nAnd it's money that becomes painless you don't even realize that it's vanished and gone into investing so\nI'm impressed with what acorns is put together\nThat's author I gives me a comfort level that I can go out there that and not worry about sharing or Maisha\nI Would feel absolutely fine investing with them\nAwesome well thanks for your from a shocker she ate\nIt so I Love this year son is teaching you things yeah absolutely\n[laughter] isn't that great Ashley's with us on the Clark Howard show hello actually how're you doing\nI'm doing great care actually he's got a question for me let's see if I can help you with\nYes I'm hiring a virtual ... helped me with the nine mundane tasks touches\nPaint fry laundry maybe groceries and things like that but it's through a pork and I know that in a qualified people but I Want to be able to get her ... and do you have something without risking credit score it ... filing my credit card agreements and things like that ... kill\nSo you're going to give this person the ability to make payments but you want to make sure they don't destroy your credit and at the same time limit access that this individual would have to your funds\nAbsolutely okay I've got something I like for that\nAnd I've only one other time of I suggested it in a situation something like yours but it seemed to fit and it's called blue bird have you ever heard of bird now if you look at ... dot com\nIt is a payment system that is a joint venture of American Express and Walmart\nAnd so you're able to issue a bluebird account\nTo this individual and they can do a bill payment for you they can do transactions on the card you can see every transaction this happening and here's the best part you control the flow of money into the blue bird account\nSo you don't put any did you put in it only the money that you need this assistant to have to do the transactions that you need them to pay for and take care of\nGreat that's exactly what I mean the exactly my requirements I thank you\nAnd the other thing with blue bird read through all the all the ways it works as long as you jump through all the right hoops with blue bird you'll pay no fees at all\nTo have this doesn't count for this assistant perfect\nNow you're only risk is let's say you do run into a problem with this individual\nA hundred dollars and the blue bird count at that time\nAnd so you decide you got to let this person go 'cause they're not performing well or they have not proven to be trustworthy or whatever bill last amount of money you have on deposit they have access to may well be at risk\nAbsolutely so but you know you will know the amount and it would be kept by the amount that you put in there that you've trusted him with yes\nAnd that's a risk and willing to take up to a certain dollar value\nOkay so it is of the possibilities it's number one for what you're trying to accomplish there and I hope that you find that it works well for you if it turns out that were burned to bust I Need to know that so I can take that information into account next time I might talk about it\nThere and is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Darren how are you today\nEric thanks for the call Michael\nCertainly you want to talk about your child or children\n[noise] yeah I had a question I all of a at a test with credit freeze you are\nAnd [noise] my wife and I as a counter frozen than we are as our daughter's\nA ... we've got a Social Security number on her but my question is why do they even have a credit files on minors or ... why do they even had activity if they're not you know legally able to find her any hangar open new accounts\nSo criminals are exploiting a loophole and how the three major credit bureaus do business so the credit bureaus what they do is they ... they make money collecting data they make money selling data and so they build ... on\nOn anybody who anyone reports credit activity on so they didn't start off with a file on your young daughter\nBut what happens with a dinner eat theft in childhood enemy theft is far more likely to occur than for an adult\nIs someone will assume your child Social Security number and they'll do it for many different reasons their favorite is it there's no history there so they all started applying for things as if\nThey are not necessarily your daughter but using her number and so that's what creates the file with the credit bureaus and voila suddenly\nThe crook has taken over your daughter Social Security number and potentially created a whole new identity because remember there was no pre existing record for your daughter\nSo what child credit freeze does is the credit bureau actually creates an empty file for your daughter based on\nHer name and her Social Security number and then freezes it which prevents anybody from applying for credit or doing things as if they are the holder of that Social Security number\nGotcha yeah they credit bureaus are crushed checking the Social Security number against day birth date\nAbsolutely not\nBecause that would like to watch that\nNo that would cost them money to the credit bureaus there was no necessity or even desire of the credit bureaus to be very accurate\nOur phone colors are guaranteed\nHike in Russia have higher or I'd like to share my pride and granted\nYou have a high

yesterday gentleman stop me who was very animated and very angry about a health club but he was a member of that he ended his membership but they were still drafting is checking account\nAnd this is a problem that happens again and again when you allow an auto debit for\nCar loan for any kind of product or service when you give permission for any place\nTo go into your checking account and take whatever they want through a C H automated clearinghouse you need to know that your rights under the law or pathetic\nBut when a business or any organization takes money\nThat way it is a real chore a real hard thing and many times he will never be able to get your money back so if you want the convenience of making sure that bills get paid on time\nSet up where you are in charge where you set up to automatically pay each month on a credit card 'cause you have a whole bunch of rights if a business does a charge against your credit card that they shouldn't have done or you use your own bill pay\nThrough your credit union or bank where you're controlling the payments that go\nYou've set up automatically but you're the boss when you quit some service or whatever or you've made the last payment on a loan or something like that you go into your bill pay and you just continue paying\nThe problem with the drafting with the AC age because you have virtually no rights is that if money is taken either by mistake or on purpose\nIt is extremely difficult to get that money ever refunded in return to you and nobody is looking out for you so used to be ability you have to protect yourself\nBy you always being in charge of the payments you make and how they're made because otherwise you'll be calling me and saying why do I do know Hey Joe I\nThink we have time to sneak into

orientation and it was obvious that there was a lot of um opportunity for cross contamination\nAnd so in a couple of days she was there for orientation she kinda crap depending on one other thing from there and thought I Need to get something else so I'd ask to\nBe exempt from that dining plan and they're saying no\nShe's not allowed to be exiled to have and\nWe talk here 'cause we got a similar thing going on with my daughter and that uh for her housing assignment yet she had requested that that she be with a roommate that had food allergies as well four roommates I Would agree to have no\nPeanut products in the dorm room 'cause you know those dorm rooms here on top of each other\nAnd she got lost in the shuffle and she's with two roommates both of whom she's communicated with on social media both of whom are not products are very important part of their diets\nAnd so now and and we've got her advocating for herself she's been working with the school to try to get a different housing assignment and wearing count down to going as well and have a similar issue so ah on the food side\nWhen I Would do is get outside the bureaucracy of the school\nAnd may send a letter to the chairman of the board of trustees\nOkay\nAnd it's an obvious thing that no school and what goes back to flatten or Greek and local rent is you know school is a is ever supposed to put a student and life and death danger\nAnd it's an old legal concept and the school by being careless is doing exactly that with your daughter and isn't it is a proper thing that if they can't provide\nA safe environment for people aren't aware your daughter in mind can die but almost immediately from being exposed to cross contaminated not or peanut products\nAnd it's one of those things people roll their eyes were they get a rash or something they don't get it there's an F lactic shock and awe instant death\nAnd so it's possible that the administrators at the school don't get to the life and death aspect of it either so I had never heard of the allergy till our child almost died one day from it and I get how dangerous it is so I Would uh if you're\nGoing to advocate for her or she should be advocating for herself as well\nI Would find out who the chairman of the board is and that's who I Would immediately contact okay stand yet I'll work it out there that there are threats what's that\nBecause I've been working with like the directors of dining and and they're simply saying well it's really up to the director of housing\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and not a fear of credit mumbo jumbo and they don't care if your kid doesn't live they don't care about that you're the one who has to carry your daughter has to care about herself and that's why you go outside the bureaucracy\nAnd you make it now I I don't see anything wrong with calling the president university\nOkay where there any other advice that you have that's your daughter goes off\nWell I mean have you on your daughter's Eighteen or Nineteen and has lived with us how long\nAbout sixteen years\nYeah so just like you know my daughter was a almost died it too so we've been fully aware of it or allergy is not lessons you know we do the tests overtime hasn't lessened\nAnd so I I feel like if they are age they're good at protecting themselves that they're not going to you know ... at late teen they know the drill and they know the risk\nAnd and making sure she's always got to at the patterns that are in day is important but you don't want to have to use those you want to use your good judgment to avoid any situation where you might die my daughter can't even go to a baseball game\nNo no I ... yeah so there is no baseball in our [laughter] our household right um\nBut time here as soon as she said oh I don't understand\nAnd and how could they I mean why would anybody understands price because if they haven't experienced it firsthand there's no way so\nIt's not like we should be mad at other people for not carrying they don't know how important it is that's why we've got to let them know ... ... ... of hey no follow up with me let me know how it plays out when you start reaching outside the

outstanding a lot of credit goes to crate council the way he's been able to use them\nAs well to Derrick Johnson the pitching coach and lead comical bullpen coach um they they've done great work with that entire boss he's long\nVersion also just loving joined me so how does the pitching staff now stack up or Thursday I assume with the days off they're going to be in great shape to kind of go forward into the divisional series\nCalled the two days of rights are massive and I'm ... allows you to line up your rotation the way to watch your not going to have you seen in game them on because he went five and two thirds yesterday [noise] um but he's going to be available for maybe three or or potentially game you're probably getting three though\nUm you know you you you can line up the guys that you want you get those open guy records they need\nAnd I'm In the two days off your are are so important and and the brewers and among September had every Thursday off\nUm to allow themselves to kind of get themselves ready\nAnd fired a wave postseason then here we are and um depending on who went wild card game today whether that comes to the Rockies the brewers are going to be in good shape yet this year tea with Chicago ... five to seven against the Rockies or during the regular season so you're pretty good shape heading into the division series plus you have\nA home field advantage throughout the entirety of the nationally portion the playoffs too that's really important in\nGiven what happened yesterday in Chicago do the cubs have an advantage tonight playing that game against the Rockies there [noise]\nI Would think so because Colorado in in three different times last Seventy two hours they were Colorado to finish up their series against Washington on Sunday had to fly to LA and play yesterday now they're playing in the mid west of the day they're playing three different time zones in three different days or they're throwing ... free Lyndon three days

fans will be there this team is coming off an incredible\nA high from winning winning out the season playing in St Louis playing in Chicago playing at home at Miller Park over the weakening of some tigers can you sustain that high throughout these playoffs can tendency and do that\nI think they can um and it helps with the schedule at the post season because you don't play every not like you're playing seven consecutive days are and they said there is that are built in\nSo you have those highs winning contest but then you also have the rest it's built in to like open to get the time that they need so it it really is helpful they get the best out of every single player I think you can get them the most rats\nI think they can sustain it whether they I don't know if they're going to run the table nobody runs table I don't think and um\nYou know there there's you're playing against the best teams in baseball at this point you know I'm you're down to the final four once in a while or give them the day and the brewers had the best record in the nationally curry so I think they can sustain their um they have the confidence\nAre either done today and the brewers have the best record in the national league hurry so I think they can sustain their um they have the confidence there's no doubt about that so it's just a matter of getting out there and not being too overconfident and

that's appropriate you can also find us on Facebook\nThat WWW dot say sports icon slashed WGM Jay the school board refused to comment when asked by NBC\nUm it it does beg the question what the heck are you doing when it comes to these school events where they just wanted to leave the homecoming is anybody paying attention to the world they live in or the idea that maybe it's not a good idea to somebody\nFor any reason in this case the relationships that us let's go to Wesleyan mosquito you're on WGM Jake morning wasn't born where do you think [noise] I think\nThe whole thing is absolutely ridiculous the reason why kids go to school in the first place is for an education and they want them to be focused on this stuff I mean this is a it's a stupid idea has it's inappropriate completely\n... said they've they've they've experienced this locally I've never heard of something like this\nI think it's stupid out all the school could be focusing on like national pride or school spirit or something is beneficial to the community there putting kids in a situation where they're being sexual like at a young age and that's not healthy for anybody\nYeah great great take was the I think was the gets it we can all have fun we can all especially with these homecoming festivities an activity that's the idea right kids should be encouraged to have fun celebrate their school have fun with their with their classmates how does this fall into that category\nOne by calling attention to yourself not the school will not be homecoming events\nAnd to it it also good to be perceived by some if they don't participate as as you know these kids aren't even worthy of our attention 'cause they didn't even bother to do this bill on Facebook says like the school board is off they're not I agree how to get past the school board\nAnd um and I asked this question again because I truly believe it's not just this ... this issue is other issues there's a disconnect and there's way too much control to given to principals\nAnd staff in school districts that's not warranted or deserved why do I say that because I'm constantly reading stories like this are just that suggest\nCrazy ideas that somebody thought would be funny or are clever or in this case tied to homecoming that have no place in the school system yes have fun color day knock yourself up were\nBlue shirts if your high

in it so if you don't think it's a good idea you know\nShould that should have school districts be being involved in the relationship business I think that's the question here yeah it ... it may seem innocent to some people and you're in a relationship [noise] cool if you're not I guess that school to it that's how you choose to to be but should you be should be making these kind of assessments or or putting this on these kids\nIm assessments or or putting this on these kids when they're especially in middle school when really as relationship status the most important thing about homecoming or their education\nNo absolutely not\nAll right thanks for the call Jason calling from ... one or we can also find us on Facebook at WWW dot ... dot com slash six twenty WGM Jay [noise]\nI'll say it again\nProbably somebody at that school so I you know this is kind of an innocent idea let's have a son with the citizens homecoming dance usually associated with this event at the end of it on

Domingo Santana for example and and Santana has become a pitch pinch hitter extraordinary you know what do you do with him what do you do with Curtis Granderson ... you know we're ... how do you a line when you go from twenty five where you go from forty to twenty five\nBut that's a nice problem to have the depth on this team I think is absolutely been amazing and to your point Mike about Craig council no like I I Am a fan he's a whitefish bay guy and we we live he my old house he was he was a neighbor but I I Will tell you I think council\nHas absolutely the right temperament for this team no look\nThe whole part of the fun about baseball is second guessing moved ... should have started yellowish they against the cubs ... did he did he get a little bit over zealous when he pulled a pitcher to sooner too late or whatever that there's always going to be that degree of second guessing but day in\nDay out I think Craig council has the perfect temperament for this team doesn't get too high doesn't get too low he's not one of these guys who is going on these tirades of throwing water coolers or stuff like that\nAnd I mean I I just always remember when the brewers hit that rough patch\nWhere they were playing twenty three games in twenty three days and remember the last five in a row in Pittsburgh and everybody was jumping off the bandwagon counsel was just like a ... it's a long season and again I think he's had the perfect temperament for this and this is my friend Wayne Larrivee always says it's not who you play it when you play them\nAnd you want to talk about rounding into form this brewers team has has really rounded into form let's talk to chat and walk each address WM J. lo\nHey there um yeah I was just going to comment on your decision of you know what team is the best for the brewers right I Would have to say that you're definitely that that just because if you look at the way that baseball with played in eighty two eleven and all eight\nEverything about numbers now so I mean you have a team who's gone again percentages that are in favor of an opposing team and they still manage it over three hundred they do manage to do to watch it rankled the eighty two teams you that when you have the match up for a guy comes in or one\nOr the way the ship are made or things of that nature I mean you know ... I don't think could have done it either and the eleven made it because that kind of I think when it started if you buy it evolved so much than you\nWere that a great sure definitely but could they have done it the way that they fall right now I don't think\nYeah and and that's not a knock on the eighty two team I mean I understand it's kind of heresy I I did some of my fondest memories of my favorite sporting event\nMaybe the two thousand ten Superbowl but with the exception of of that it was it was being at county stadium for those last three games between the brewers and the California Angels when the brewers had to come back and win three in a row and I mean it's it's just great memories and it was a great team and Robin ... in his prime and Paul ... prime and\nYou know that they'd hit home runs but just\nJust steps in the way the game is played you know twenty five man roster compared to twenty five man roster I I I think this is just great in Christian yellow\nOscar I I think this is just great and Christian yellowish me Christian yell at you having as good a season I think his any brewer has ever had in history and that includes Robin ... includes promoter\nNow thanks to call them and what and and and what a lot of fun I mean the other thing and the the eighty two team had fun as well and this is I mean it just you get the impression that these guys like each other\nA my limited contact you know when I get I get the interview a bunch of them on opening day in the dugout by limited contact is needle like each other they're glad to be here you don't have you got you got a mix of veterans but it's it's not these jaded guys and you know every once in a while\nThere's teams of destiny you you need certain breaks I mean think back on all these teams that did have one and done well a lot of times\nThey're they're getting break and just look at the last week okay you have\nThat game that they've gotta win against the St Louis cardinals their their head\nAnd then the stock is throws the ball down the right field line the St Louis cardinals runaround third and he he does a face plant trips me he's going around thirty hundred times he's not going to trip but but he trips and then you have the game I was at the game against the tigers friday night\nYou have the the fly ball to ... fly ball to right field in the eighth inning\nI couldn't even see this from where I was sitting but they're right fielder goes back he essentially catches the ball but it rolls out of his glove it rolls along with the top of the wall and then falls over that that area I mean that that the ball probably should have been caught\nBut I mean it could have just fallen down you've got a double instead it just it's being at the right place\nAt the right time so you can have this debate it's not knocking the eighty two team but I tell you I I think\nI think man for man I think this is the best brewers team ever\nAnd I think that they're going to have a pretty darn decent run into the play offs and the fact that they have home field advantage that just makes it even cooler\nBoth twenty ...\nThe best deal on the air during breaks that are based model you're clear\nWhere the ... family and do it yourself bathroom center near state fair sixty ticketing rich it's easy to replace your old worn out ... hour we'll show you how you knew bathroom will be beautiful and really stay clean or install estimates are for a member of slogan I did it myself and do it yourself [noise]\nBut here you have one of the most exciting baseball games of the year at one point in time one guy is complaining 'cause he had to take a flight earlier this morning and he was stuck in a middle seat on the United airlines\nBut then then you get to the fifth inning now that the brewers starting pitcher stretching pitch he had a no hitter going through four innings not a perfect game but uh no hitter comes out destructive fifth inning\nAnd the cubs power hitting first baseman result Anthony ... hits a home run tied the game one one All right\nAt that point in time this car rabbits goes on this lengthy diatribe about how great council should have pulled his starting pitcher\nAnd I admit I'm sitting there I'm screaming he's got a no hitter going this he's got a no hitter going through four innings and yet the Anthony reserves just hit a home run\nBut but who's gonna who's gonna pull a pitcher after four innings of no baseball and he keeps going on and on a couple of the other guys that are in the booth or try to talking down because they think they realize how dumb this is but he's just back it up well you know council got this great bullpen that this is what happens when you leave him into long\nAnd then it it kind of went from bad to worse to the point that\nI'm now yelling at the TV which is always a bad science so at that point in time I get up during one of the commercial breaks I go down\nInto the basement I retrieve\nA ... year old from the basement bring it upstairs and fire it up and and live with the the out of sync thing because I I just couldn't stand it any more\nAnd it just again it convinced me that for these national broadcasters especially\nFolks who don't cover the brewers you know because the truth is an an ESPN unless you're the Boston Red Sox were the Los Angeles Dodgers were of course the New York Yankees you don't get any coverage all the brewers haven't been on once on the it'd be the ESPN Sunday night broadcast which is they're kind of future thing\nBut I'm I'm listening to this and I'm shouting and shouting at the the TV going oh come on I mean is this really the best you can do\nAll right brewers nation want to give you a chance to vote for one for seven nine nine which six twenty that's the ac unit mortgage talking text line is if you ended up\nWatching the game yesterday and hearing the announcers you had the ESPN broadcast feed\nDid it strike you as being as awful\nAs it is it seemed to me like I said the might might breaking point was when the guy who's criticizing Craig counsel for not pulling the starting pitcher who had a no hitter going after four innings and ends up giving up a home run for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the acting at mortgage talk and text line\nAgain it just completely and totally convinced me that if you're going to be a brewers fan\nEspecially since you have these broadcasters who really don't know this team and having covered the team and don't pay attention to the team\nOr you're you're much better off much better off getting listening to the whole broadcast 'cause yesterday it was a frustrating one for me for one for seven nine nine one six twenty we discuss next if you're on the line please hold on brewers fever catch it it's twelve forty two jak record

[noise]\nDid you know that there's a hidden time bomb in your portfolio it's their\nView at machine operator experience are you a go getter that's exactly what MPs corky there now hiring experience nighttime machine operators and nighttime maintenance technicians hiring bonus now offered she'll come from within the black today at NPR dot com or dot com\nShe's part in this ...\nEconomically depressed Madison neighborhood\nAnd it just in the district and she's she's doing what candidates do she's knocking on doors talking to constituents that's what it's simply candidates to\nAnd she's parked apparently what happens is her mother is driving the car and her daughter is in the back seat of the car and so they're parked on this block while she goes up and down knocking on doors All right well\nWhat happens is somebody calls the police\nAnd the police report says fully occupied silver for doors to Dan newer model\nThinks they are waiting for drugs at the local drug house would like them moved along so somebody makes this call now again that the woman she's knocking on doors the driver is her Seventy one year old mother and her eight year old daughter Randall I'm sort of great your granddaughter is in the back seat\nSo police officer comes out to get this call to check it out and goes up and talks to her and she says no where this this is my mother this is my granddaughter I I'm running for office and the officer says okay sorry well we got this call we just came to check it out so no harm no foul they go on their way\nWell the the lady the woman who's going to be in the state assembly she goes public with this\nAnd she of course\nYou know plays the race card in in a big way\nShe says that um she's just she's heartbroken she's going to have to explain to her daughter the eight year old who's in the car what happened she heartbroken she humiliated it's two thousand Eighteen it shouldn't be strange the black woman knocking on your door I didn't do anything to make myself stand out\nI felt like they thought I didn't belong here\nAs she's real clear she's not she's not upset with the police officer that came out\nBut she's upset with whoever it was it called the sea and\nThen she says I Belong where I Choose to go you don't have to like me you don't even have to respect me but I have a right to be places um she said she'd been in the neighborhood for twenty minutes she knocked on five or six doors but she found is degrading humiliating insulting\nThat somebody had it called the police on her and she immediately says oh this has to be because I was a black woman in in this this area and there was a car was parked there right now we talked about this at the time and and my\nMy attitude at the time was well maybe there's there there is is more to this story well apparently\nThe lady she'll is jobs has received a letter um that that it's anonymous\nBut it's written by the person who claims to have been the one who made the phone call and and here's what the the letter says the letter says\nI never called the police on you but rather I called the police to report about a car that was sitting idle person said I didn't see you knocking on any doors I'm the person who who writes this letter and this is kind of the background of the place\nThey said look this house has been a problem there is a drug house on this block\nThe drug house was active throughout the night and the cars would wait for dealers to return when no one was home they\nAlso said people camped out in the house is back yard ... as well um so that the guy says this is a drug or whoever wrote the letters that this is a drug house\nI all I saw and we have a problem with cars that were parked and people would sit and they would wait for the drug dealers to come home and they would wait and wait\nAnd yeah I saw this car was parked there and yes I I called the the police apparently since June of twenty Seventeen police had been called to this property twenty six\nTimes um other calls involve suspected drug\nDealers so the point is you know at least that the person writing this letter say looked at this wasn't about your race this was about you know the neighborhood and this was an area you're parked right down the street from a neighborhood drug house the\nCar was parked it had been there for a period of time and yeah we called the police to check it out and the police came and they checked it out and they found out that you weren't waiting to buy drugs and everybody went on their way right our number for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the ac unit mortgage\nTalking and text line now for her part the lady's going to be an assembly she's saying I'm not accepting this I don't consider to be an apology why don't consider to be an apology either I consider it to be an explanation and to me it is a perfectly rational and reasonable explanation as I said before\nDon't we tell people if you see something say something and if you know you're in an area there is a drug house on a block\nYou have a problem with cars that are parking waiting for the drug dealers to come home is it unreasonable\nFrom home is it unreasonable to to make a phone call when you see a car parked and it's this is this an attempt to humiliate or degrade or a woman who you know a black woman who's running for office or is it a reasonable type of response\nFrom neighbors who care about their neighbors to the neighborhood to have for one for seven nine nine with six twenty now I said this is a time and I say it again I don't think the person who made this call\nDid anything wrong as a matter of fact I think this played out exactly like it was supposed to play out\nYou've got a you've got a neighborhood it's got problems apparently there's a house that they had all sorts of problems including calls about drug activity in the past\nThe pattern is cars will park in front of the house\nGuy sees this card that his parked in front of the house you call the cops the cops come out they investigate they determined it's not a drug deal\nEverybody goes on their own way why should that be humiliating or degrading to the woman who's running for state assembly all she simply says no this isn't me I'm knocking on doors on TALK of the potential constituents isn't this a no harm no foul deal and isn't this\nI guess how we want people to operate particularly in these higher crime areas or areas where you've got a suspected drug house don't we want people making calls to the police for one for seven nine nine one six twenty should we be concerned that\nShe if it turns out we're wrong and these aren't drug dealers will now we're going to all get labeled as being racist or is this something that's positive and by the way we don't know the race of the person that that made the complaint one way or the don't know if they're white or black they apparently send the letter that they're they don't want to give their name because\nThey are afraid that they will be vilified and I think there's some merit to that for one for seven nine nine one six twenty to the person who make that made this call under these circumstances do anything wrong we discuss in just a minute if you're on the line please hold on it's one forty five ... there'll be Tim Jay\n[noise]\nBudget evolved\nOver here on my hands him\nAs

brewers in games one in two at Miller Park also on the program tonight will come down some of our best in favorite moments from the season we've got a top ten list put together\nIn a couple of bonus games as well so we'll do that sort of throughout the program and hear from Tom how the court of the journal sentinel coming up at six thirty three I Do have in my hand here after looking at it right now ah it took me a couple of hours to do\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenties the academic mortgage talk in sex line are you watching the game tonight thinking man I Love to see the match up against the cubs would you like the brewers to be the team that ends the cubs season or you more of the camp of hey I don't want the gums I'd rather they lose as soon as humanly possible\nStart to Jake in West bend a W TMZ I drink\nLike Greg thanks so much for taking my call ... or to have the Rockies to win because you know companies got\nThree years of experience with the F layoffs Rockies or in the playoffs and all night and you know they just they just got strong hangs\nPlayers got by as that's still in the end the ... on on this Donald if they're yeah they didn't do the greatest is what I thought I mean there's still that great based on Monday but I Would like to rock on and on and\nIt would be great to see you know\n... ... copies play again and fever feed 'em but I Would feel more comfortable with rocket\nTickets have better maps of for the brewers\nI think so definitely and I think it'd be I mean don't get around Rockies or they are in that spot for a reason they're so pretty pretty hot um but uh I was ... so I actually have\nYou ever have you have you back for the phone call Jake thanks for checking in Mason is up next the Milwaukee on WGM J.\nYeah Hey Greg or by heart I had had a you know I really want to take the Rockies you your ticket waited a lot of the reason\nI'm you know the rotation or once you get beyond freeway and really our cat\nIs a great the cubs to have a very deep rotation\nOr they had an equine up there one through six or walk through seven if you include the ... um is is a lot better than the rocket which really are looking at the danger area they're being Trevor Story Charlie Black hair NATO I'm the one actually feel or the or credit card as we thought okay\nI'm Sorry I think the Iraqis would be better match up at ... am I my heart\nI Want another card and I I Want to cut a quarter bake a through the heart of the notion that the brewers are sort of a you know the the the cars and the fact that the doctor or something like that or the the side of a kind of a second class second cheer\n'em and I think a pay cut Gary you take it your game five in the brewers you stop on a mat I Would feel good\nI Would feel like the baton or the torch is being passed but I think if something like that happened Mason I'm totally with you on that I don't know if in the eyes of cubs fans\nYou know winning a game one sixty three make them feel like well the torch has been passed the brewers are new the new you know big boys on the block you know the ... one for division titles in a row in one of the world series I there are still incredibly potent team\nWhat'd you love to just get a knock them down another wrong\nI I'm getting I'm with you as well I you know my heart says Boise great to just get the cubs I don't like the cubs and the cubs are one of the teams that I enjoy seeing lose more than any in all professional sports\nFor the handful of teams on that list including the Seattle Seahawks the Minnesota Vikings to St Louis cardinals the cubs are part of the group is well I just want to see a loose doesn't matter who they play I Want to see them lose I enjoy them losing\nThat's OK isn't it maybe I have some deep rooted issues but I like to see them lose\nSo for ... for me it's a night it would be satisfying for the cubs to lose to the Rockies and I do believe the brewers match up well with Colorado and it points to the seeds in the series and how things play out the birth control the west in general and took up the series against the cubs excuse me against the Rockies\nI just kind of get the feeling the cubs wind up is ready to explode I think they've been quiet for too long it's a gut feeling more than anything\nBut every time I see you know who's up and who's going to be facing brewers pitching I think to myself well boy that's a little dangerous with the Rockies you have to get through you know three or four guys\nThe Rockies you have to get through you know three four guys\nI feel like it's a little deeper with the cubs for one for seven nine nine one six twenty if you'd like to join the on the program tonight we will begin to tell me that our top to in moments of the brewers regular

[noise]\n... it'd be great to knock him out in a perfect world if you said yeah it'd be great to go to a game five of them went on a game winning home run and sent all the cubs fans who are you know back to Chicago\nOr disappointed and whatever but let's just get them out of the playoffs will not deal with um I'm about to deal with the Rockies and and just move on from there\nYeah here's my general thought when I watch the cubs play and they're down six to chew and it's the seventh inning I've seen enough cubs baseball to think oh God it's not over yet when I see the Rockies play a game of their down six doing the seventh inning I'm not as worried\nI Know the brewers are going to work on their roster it's not do here for a couple of days but what do you see town is the biggest decision grandparents on David service will have to make for the divisional series\nIt's always the back and they'll go officer who are the final lose all we all know the front end guys are going to be\nBut they got to figure out who they can and can't put on the bench and then who they can and can't put in the bullpen and how many starting picture if you want to go with that you're going to go with three or four or go with three and then a whole bunch of relievers who used to be starters you know that it's just\nI I think twenty spots are easy to do and it's the last five that get interest\nI I think you need for starting pitchers into divisional series don't you unless you want to go three days rest or a short wrestling with a guy like you know Wade mildly who I assume would start game one of the divisional series\nWell who knows at them you know they don't let their stars pitched very much right you know so they could very short and then just use more both and God they they're way more inclined to use relief pitchers and they are\nUm starting pitchers I mean they made it to Ninety six victories\nWith only one starting pitcher in double figures and when I mean how can you do that that doesn't even the possible yet they did\nThey all their victories are and they're both parents and that they use them so much the other thing that gets under way up there starting pitchers getting victories of the old Dickey rule that you got to go fight betting\nTomorrow to go to the journal sentinel joining us on rivers tonight it'll be the brewers and somebody\nWill after four o'clock on Thursday that cable get going does tonight's game impact Ross turtle Tom here's where I'm getting here's where I'm going pretty Peralta just crushed the cubs in his first ever career start Thirteen strike out it was amazing uh you watched it I watched it\nDoes that in any way influenced the the roster decision given the previous success against a team\nAll that good a roster wall depending on who they're playing Colorado or Chicago but I don't think it'll be a lot different either way\nBut that's I'm left handed starters so you don't want right hand the bench guys\n... you know guys like scope Santana they can squeeze in them that somehow ... match up they'll want to or don't want to be a good combination Whitey left it so I Do think the spot\nAll the time and will be
