Democrats could have it but that's how you win elections\nWell and he's going to I Hope he comes to Wisconsin at some point he's not going to come to Milwaukee or Madison but you know go out to to ... northern Wisconsin and and get people excited and and get the multiple 'cause right now\nWe're we're struggling a little bit and even as it comes to the state elections we talk about the governor's race there kind of a a lack of enthusiasm there for the Republicans and we need to get them out not just for\nA ... leave all clear but the Scott Walker and all of the Republicans and they suddenly and Senate\nAnd Corey I'll give you the last word under the president's role going for we mentioned a little bit but uh he's gonna be house now trying to energize the Republican base that's that's frankly not been there in the last six months or so we've seen a huge ramp up by Democrats now Republicans need to charge the November can do it\nI I think you can I think you can do it and I think he should do it by trying to stick to topic like the economy um topics that are hard for Democrats to disagree with 'em I mean everybody's experience and they've been in the economy I think it I think everybody fairly excited about that on and I think yes I think he should stick to non controversial topics I think we should kind of\nUm lettuce Kavanaugh saying hopefully he'll get confirmed tomorrow and you can just let us fail on through but I think he I think he's really focus on the economy\nIt's amazing to watch the news today forty nine year low on the unemployment rate barely scratched the surface of national media costs because it's all about what's happening in Washington DC with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's a story number almost five decades low you have treated like it doesn't matter it's not the president's credit that's the treasured part of this Corey Peterson Jersey Johnson more was on measurements shipped to education if this governor in education governor is Tony Evers writes all that much but friday for a long\nOff his way out your camera\nShot so she read their hopes and a rocket to Colorado says is the hardest thing\nEverybody present a call once again\nAnd our coverage starts to forty this afternoon you east so sheen pitcher he did a great job earlier this week I think you'll do a great job for the game to an LDS Miller Park I Will be there after the show\nAmong say Hi to care if you see me wondering the confines of Miller Park or around there right now we're in the friday for a tutor for people from different walks of life Corey Peterson Tracey Johnston education Wisconsin there's a lot of different opinions or just to watch TV\nStudios waivers on one side Scott Walker Governor Scott Walker and the other what should we believe in education course\nWell I I think that education are the biggest thing that both sides are doing wrong as the funding\n'cause I think a lot of what needs to change of this plant where where to a point of diminishing marginal returns with the amount of money we throw at education and so I think a Walker increasing funding for education and then of course even the Democrats I I think both sides are wrong to do that I think what we need to be changing how we educate kids\nAnd so I think it's essential ... I mean at this point they were they throw more and more money and nothing nothing changing the kids aren't getting just aren't aren't being better educated a lot of it it's going to\nTeach her benefits um which certainly don't need to be expanded I'm Sorry I think we just need to address thing Scott Walker a ... as a Republican should care a lot more about I'm not just getting money to the schools that caring about what's actually happening in the schools and how the kids are being\nTaught us a great point because it it it it was just this narrow focus on the amount of money to mhm\nDevoted to education it's been less so um the actual basic tenets with education the the the math or science stuff it seems like we've lost track of that in this in this mission to expand the choices for kids maybe it's not so much of a choice maybe it's just went back to base\nWell and if you look at the numbers I mean we are absolutely right in the middle we are we're both candidates are touting the success in education which is ...\nIs ... we rank like twenty three and twenty second in every category in the nation and then let's just not look at the entire world here because we're like fifteenth place our education system\nIt needs some work and that has the opportunity I think for both candidates what are you going to do in this next term Governor Walker what are you going to do Tony ... you've had the ability to to do more ... and take advantage of that opportunity as far as it sat Walker the education governor\nUm I think his messaging should be more about the job creation confuse the shops governor and I don't think you can be all things to all people because you ... this this education battle is won that can't be one\nAs much as as Governor Walker been tough enough on Tony ... in this and that's supposed to specific part of this race and education that's the guy in charge of the problem of public instruction has he been tough enough on TALK until years\nI think he I think he has been very ... he could stand to be tougher I think he also should be tough on the legislators I think that they're the ones making the law what laws well Tony Evers was an executive position he\nWasn't the lines of writing in passing laws\nI Want to go back to school choice for a second because I think what school choices actually showed us is that for we can get better education for lack of funding 'cause that's a lot of the charter schools a lot of the um the Milwaukee parental choice program has shown us that for fewer dollars in the classroom kids can improve their scores of do a lot better\nAnd better test result right well and how great would it be if our school superintendent and our governor could work together to create these solutions I mean this is a nonpartisan position the position of superintendents but it's so political and it's been so politicized I just think of of that world where\nYou could have both people working together to to create those outcomes for the kids\nRight right ... recording produce and joining me on the friday foreign let's shift to the ... [noise] I don't care who goes first explain to me how this thing has been a work how it's going to deal with our Wisconsin's winter is how it's going to make sense for anybody so those people will

study says only one third of Americans could do that and I and my show no separate and we wonder why we're at where we're at people have no sense of history of the country they live in\n\nAnd how those two things matter when you're talking about current events and and surprise surprise we get to the current situation in our country with politics and culture and uh\nThey shouldn't be surprising given that we don't know our history at all\nBut we're going to spend some time in the next few minutes talking about the the cabinet nomination I'm actually after the break I'm going to read from an

your\nCareer were threatened would you not react the way Brett Kavanaugh reacting\nI think a lot of us for a lot of us the answer would be yes permanent ... does leave from his op ed in the wall

other places related to their big win over the uh\nThe visiting team at the Miller Park or the Rockies or they played well they came back in the night feeling I didn't look good the Jeffries was struggling in ah somehow they got it done the uh the bullpen game\nThat strategy a ... I should say next to Jeff Jeff ...\nIn a somehow they got it on the uh the bullpen game that strategy jak pressure I should say and I said Jeffries Jeffress um the um the bullpen committee game seemed to work well\nI I was listening to ... because a broadcast news talking about that is that the future face of baseball it won't be starting pitchers relief pitchers will just be pitchers\nAnd uh you know we've seen the the amount of time that the pitchers piss used to be guys had complete games there used to be used to be a big stat and baseball and the ... is slowly got whittled away now five innings gets you the when we see less and less about every year so baseball's changing\nThankfully this year it's changing in a good way for the Milwaukee franchise so lots of excitement here in Milwaukee will bring a lot of that to you today on WGM they also just a a show not a he's a broadcasting legend in the market treasure he's Mr baseball ... he joins Jeff Wagner\nLater today at twelve tend to talk about the brewers in the playoffs Jeff um\nHe's a he's not just the broadcaster Jeff loves his market per season ticket holder and he had to be excited about that game yesterday as well I Want to shift gear to politics today is is one of the big days than the U.S Senate\nDemocrats didn't stop as nominations\nExamination Republicans will rally the Democratic base with the circus\nA Supreme Court will no longer have the facade of impartiality after this part isn't working there's a lot of people that believe that forever changed forever impacted by what's happened and what was happening now on the floor of the U.S Senate right now Chuck Schumer addressing the the body and his fellow senators those were there\nWhat if he's explaining why it made a decision aren't cabinet twenty minutes after the president announced it and just there's so much swirling information\nSusan Collins senator says she will now vote yes on the cloture votes and will decide on the full Senate votes of how she will vote on that in a three PM speech in front of the Senate this afternoon so we'll find out fairly soon near\nWhere routes my guess is they have the votes if if Mitch McConnell doesn't have the votes and he move this forward that would be one of the most hair brain dumb decisions you've ever made so I'm I'm feeling like they have the votes\nFor confirmation confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh but a lot of that will be decided uh in the next twenty four hours I saw this story\nAnd I think it speaks to our current state of affairs when it comes to politics is a group called the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation\nAnd they did a poll and there was a multiple choice test and it consists of questions from the U.S citizenship tests so somebody wants to a U.S citizen they have to take the tests\nYou know how many Americans current citizens in this poll pass that test\nOne in three thirty three percent here's some of the shocking things that come out of this\nPoll\nSixty percent of respondents didn't know which countries the U.S fought in World War two\n\nGermany would be of course the the major when they're the result also found that fifty seven fifty seven percent did a nominee justice and sit on the Supreme Court that would\nBe nine currently aids pending the confirmation of bread cabinet Seventy two percent either incorrectly identified aren't sure which states were part of the Thirteen original states that's a little bit tougher\nBut still one I think if you're if you're teaching history properly I think the Thirteen colonies questions part of the first second third grade civics class I Would guess\nAnd twelve percent of this poll believed Dwight Eisenhower commanded troops in the civil war\nThat's a little bit shocking of course uh he was about ah [noise]\nAlmost a hundred years later not quite but uh [noise] so civil war in the sixties World War Nineteen forty so that's kind of the current state of affairs among people that take the test so if you break it down by age\nSixty five or older Seventy four percent answer at least six of the ten questions correctly it's not a bad results\nHere's the part that's scary Nineteen percent so that's thirty three percent that ultimately pass is skewed by the higher number among seniors only Nineteen percent of respondents aged forty five or under pass the exam ... less than one in five\nGolf with a sort of [noise] ...

when Robert The Milwaukee Brewers uniform and seniors will watch the series against the cardinals and\nWas disappointed one night I Know you know what a great player and what\nHe is meant everything appreciate the phone call\nHe can for power he can hit for average he can hit any part on the field he's a good base runner he's a deep and survived the good defensive player you talk about the five tools he is a true five to player and he's clutches well comes up with big hits I don't know if there's any ... you look for a weakness in his game and you can't find it\nYeah he was an okay power hitter before this year he was in contention for the home run titled going into the final few days he drives in tons of run that\nOf the most we're living in an age right now in the brewers are

their [laughter]\nPeople don't need twenty million dollars for like you a hundred million dollars that's where you have to live in independent life and be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle that you become comfortable with so the key is a ratio is a formula\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely on the money you say and it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is ...\nOn the money you've saved and it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple Susie you went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Suzie said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nAnd not a barebones lifestyle but they're living a more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you want as you want to not money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the pile the stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it and the years following to cover the cost of inflation but let's go to a core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement and they save like a maniac and they get to a point\nYou know let's say in their mid thirties that they've saved enough money that they created real financial security it doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\nYou know I retired at thirty one and here I Am working now talking to you at sixty three\nAnd since I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to and doing what I enjoy because I had that financial security when I was thirty one\nSo don't let somebody tells you oh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars [laughter]\n[laughter] oh boy anyway you know that you have to have a goal you have to have a target you have to be realistic

features of some of those higher and plans for sixty dollars a month and taxes and fees are included the one compromise really is that if the network get super congested\nAs a metro customer you might get slow down your your priority is lower than a T Mobile customer\nWhich brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for an ... dollars a month now and that's rising some limited plants are Seventy five to Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month and taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones horizons name as not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not as that is that it's their network and so it's at forty to one gotcha with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent\n... that's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that it's a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the boost is how many stores as as an visible\nAnd all they really aren't as well there's no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you sign up for the service there you have three that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service has done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network of stores a cricket\nIs suddenly a Eighteen tease second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that they think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great pipe price points are fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know John ... who knows all included a now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month to with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is bears a grudge match of hate\nBetween a TNT and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other Eighteenth he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it's sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explained were charts and all that\nAnd got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see if saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha says that come with all of these unlimited plant\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to work with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with

you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I Am I have favorite children\nAnd so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFatality you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out of a ton of really low cost no transactions B. E. T. S.\nNo minimum account minimum to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zeroes there is such a brilliant marketing campaign around the ... zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great ... let me tell you why this came about fidelity had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a mattress vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there\nSo Fidel or the coming up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest 'cause obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international socks all free so\nA fidelity is in the game salad you know what else they've done\nWhat's that\nSo Fidel they used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up them they have an extremely low cost series\nOf a target retirement funds and then they have their old one that still has very high cost well not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering so they have become much more aggressive on the front\nAnd so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talking about\nYou have become much more aggressive on the front and so do you invest with finality and you wonder why always talked about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with Fidel itty and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystem thirty two percent cash back card\nGood for you\nExplain that because a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nYou have a two percent cash back on every every purchase you run through I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your belly account\nSo you can't manage bad timing account or they're going to be an IRA over right or a college savings plans exactly yeah\nSo so you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel that he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be offending\nFinality 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower costs but vanguard really set\nThe pattern and set the tone and took the market share and that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower cost\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I'm sure you're probably right I should be talking about that Fidel tea is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nEach time to join the millions of people using zoom video conferencing\nBoehner's\n\n\nHave voter who's the Kindle\nWe have the\n\nProof because\nYou need to find that it each other that Ryan road and frankly it or can't or marine dot com oh Wisconsin's radio station news radio WGM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nGoes to Florida specifically the panhandle\nIn the early stages of getting ready for it to date with Michael currently a tropical storm Michael is one hundred forty miles southwest of Cuba's western tip blowing it sixty miles an hour headed straight north and intensified\nThe main concern now is of looking at a strong category one or a category to storm as it makes landfall somewhere along the north eastern Gulf of Mexico the Florida Panhandle to the Big Bend area is those higher wind speeds sustained winds could be Ninety five to a hundred miles per hour winds beat that Hi you're looking at more significant wind damage possible ABC\nNews meteorologist Dan pack landfall by Michael expected Wednesday twenty people were killed in school Harry in New York when a modified limousine missed a stop sign and plowed into pedestrians and a parked car all Eighteen people and the limo were killed as we're too ...

the Texas Public policy foundation what lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have limited but but out of this debacle but we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president ah you know you add in back in a way that may be pass administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the the gold the strategy of the ... had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay in from behind the nominee\nA pressure would be so great that ah he would have been withdraw or whatever the Charles himself and so in\nThe face of these vicious\nAttacks on al ... as a stellar reputation had an amazing career as a a jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservatives stood there grilled\nPendant right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a lesson moving forward to have courage\nAnd the convictions that uh our leadership in D.C are they're represented\nIn reality can you foresee a time in let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that and my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to the bipartisan consideration that used to be traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being confirmed not dead\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this all the law the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully and uh the last attempt to hit the homerun cases to create brand new rights brand do a protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the rule of law or that there won't be so much at stake it's you won't have\nHundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee because we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on there and Harris civil law that respect

won't have these cases that make you know every single nominee a life or death by\nPartisan fight for the the ... right\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary has essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional that's not constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care what the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the vet center and so on\nA they don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way of that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators

just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expect to ...\nWell I'm certainly with you uh of course if that would have happened we would probably need to do a certain extent

mccarthy friction air they've kind of pattern that\nDown or tamped that down and try and do you think there's something there [noise]\nI think there's something there like I don't think that you're

your spouse or your children or your boss or a coworker any relationship that goes on that long that's that intimate is going to just human nature have some friction to it\nIt's what you do to get over that that you know spells out whether or not it's going to be a successful relationship in perpetuity or not even after both of them are gone from Green Bay\nI mean you look at the relationship that Brett Farr and Mike homerun had I mean was there are times where there was friction sure but they were able to always work together and now they still have a relationship to the state though they're not working together and they're not working closely together so is there some friction there\nI'm sure there is and I also think that that's human nature and I don't think that that is something that should be overly alarmed about you hear repeatedly about the friction that Tom Brady and bill ... allegedly half\nI maybe the differences they've got more Super Bowl championships to show for it than the Packers happy so is there something they're sure can they work it out I suspect they probably can but\nI you know there are a lot of problems on this Packers team that I think it goes well beyond Aaron Rodgers and Mike mccarthy there's just some personnel issues that it's just it's just not working it's not clicking right\nNow first players the game I'm going to a divine to Adams the ninth catches a hundred and forty yards I mean he he played I think he's especially playing hurts um he's a guy that shows up every week but it's hard not to look at Aaron Rodgers he had a couple of phone calls but thirty two out of fifty two four hundred and forty two yards\nAnd three touchdowns I go that I'm just because of the negatives that Rogers have the ... and they actually have a few bad throws early on in the game which kind of slowed down a ... of their progress ended up the Packers were down at happening twenty four to nothing so or any any any your thoughts on player of the game yeah and I think\nMark ... gambling is kind of showing that he can play in this league and it's going to be important because the wide receivers\nThat the Packers having banged up right now like you said even to bond to Adams who did play yesterday and played admirably yesterday that's great but they're going to need this next crop of guys to step up and\nAsk them anything brown hasn't done any edging more hasn't done it yet but Mike was valid as gambling has shown that all of this group of ... wide receivers that they drafted this past April\nThat you know if there's going to be

agree on this one\nYeah I think we did too it's the third quarter touchdown that lens ... caught a that's that that really kind of snapped the Packers off into doing something\nA it was in eleventh like fifty five yard Dr took four minutes and forty one seconds off the clock but the ... is one of those guys but boy I sure do like him personally but he has been a terrible disappointment in the year plus\nThat he's been here yeah he's he's had issues driving passes I there there there's a lot of promise on this team and and a lot of guys that that you expect would be doing better than than a they have performed\nBut when we look at this team I Do agree with you on the drive the game by the way ah there's not a lot of highlights from the game that the Packers hung in that game probably a more so than most people thought and and even the final scores I don't think reflects that the total the totality of the game but\nWhen I look at the Packers and I said at the start they're not playing sixty minutes I don't know I don't know where to look for the blame on that one\nWhether it's conditioning whether it's coaching you and I were talking during the break about the coach fatigue copies miner what Thirteen Years now now I'm sometimes the message gets stale sir I Can't motivate the same the same way you did Thirteen Years ago or even five years ago different set of players not many players left from the the twenty ten\nChampionship team well even Larry Bird set at a in a different sport he said that he would be when he agreed to coach the Indiana Pacers I'll do this for three years and after three years the message is going to get stale because guys are tired of listening to the same message and I\nAnd he put it in after three years he was like All right see\nAnd Pacers were like well no I mean you're still a coach here we still want you to coach he's like no I'm Out and he walked away because it was his firm belief now I don't know that he's a hundred percent right on that I think everybody's got their opinion on that but I think that's an interesting perspective on it and true to his word he walked away when he said he was going to walk away I think there's something\nThat I I go back to run run run run and he was not a bad manager for the brewers he led them to within two games of the world series and two thousand eleven but I think that his message at some point got stale and that's why he was one of the reasons why he was dismissed when he was dismissed\nUm you know you look at the run of the birds are on right now with the council how

... with this one del Carmen\nBob is great the great Bobby ... a guy that's ah been around since really the beginning of the brewers was called so many games so many big moments and brewers history the fact that he can enjoy a what the red hot Milwaukee Brewers are doing is is just so much fun it's so fascinating to listen to\nIt even if you can't catch the the radio broadcast live it's just fun to kind of revisit some of that stuff\nAh he's he's a treasure\nAnd you know how I Know that because other teams other fans of other teams they always talk about Bob you know when it's when the when the when they reference to Milwaukee Brewers and to have that kind of a legendary icon hall of fame broadcaster former player\nA guy that I I can remember when I was younger much younger watching on Johnny Carson used to crack Johnny Carson which wasn't an easy thing to do with his dry sense of humor\nA guy that understands the power broadcasting makes it fun for me watching these games I was at the game of last friday at Miller Park the the sense of enthusiasm this team has the the way that they've stuffed up\nIs incredible to watch and then when you think about where this team has come started off very strong whether the ... division for quite a while\nHad a bit of a rough spot going into the er the all star break and then after that they kind of reformulated their team got their energy back\nAnd I can't say enough about the manager Craig council local guy of course but somebody who\nHas been there one a couple of World Series with two different teams understands the energy understands that commitment understands the excitement that you can generate with your team\nIt's been fun to watch and for those of us who was who have been found the brewers since day one and I'm old enough to be in that group I can remember my dad telling me about going to be the first opening day I think they lost twelve to nothing out there but that was the beginning of the brewers and all these years not that many playoffs appearances\nOne trip to the world series which we all remember Nineteen eighty two air you're you're a young lad\nI don't remember it but I hear about it\nWhile I was in college when that happened it\nIt might my producer joined reminds me he wasn't even born yet so for a lot of newer fans this is all you know incredibly new experience but for those of us have been around for a while I said the other day I think it's time to revisit\nAnd reshape our World Series memories and this is I think a good opportunity they got to get through the next series but uh as my countdown\nSympathize and I will be praying for it down because they are going to need everyone to give them the ... part they're going to need\nWe're joined by ... now this initiative and ...

in the downtown ... area\nAnd that was quite a process even eating it here\nTo that point I mean that took some work it's not like you could just make the application and then it shows up you have to retrieve that you have to move it do you have to go through some insurance situations I Know that we don't need to get into all of that but that was a story in itself even getting that steel beams from point a to point F\nIt as a ... once uh the application was proved the steel was at a hangar it um and JFK Airport that's where all the artifacts ended up that we're going to be released and we used to museums\nOr however the insurance requirements to get it off JFK wherever slowly\nDaunting and ah how do we get this off\nWe're joined by Gordon and Kathy ... their daughter and he died in

squares so I'm apologizing in advance or whoever I sit next to the white on\nA regular folks have security wondered about them not right [laughter]\nWell that by my radio when that was a firearm so we have to start\nThere oh boy so so I Want to ask you about the specifics of that series a Colorado a lot of fire power but uh I I think all of us are shocked and how the brewers pitching staff was able to shut down down\nPretty amazing stuff when you think about it no one ever NATO is it all starts robbers story of better laws that are currently black men as an all star game five in three games and some of the aircraft I mean it's just unbelievable to think about\n... thirty eight year old journey man and he outperformed the ... for the rocky and I think that's the thing with the rockets guy just beyond those three all stars there's just not a lot else you can rely on\nUm another open it pretty well down to strike but they did not just well I think\nIn a series against the brewers so collectively [noise] you know the birth came up with enough time to get them and it really put this game out of reach when it looked to be a little a little bit tighter early on\nAs as we watch these games and I was at the friday game at Miller Park and I watched on TV yesterday I'm impressed by the maturity of a scene that has a lot of young players on it\nAnd I I guess the question is are the veterans that that are on it seemed the bronze you ours are the most ... are they shaping to some ways the maturity level of the of the younger players\nI think it's kind of a a no fear attitude and you know and trust in one another to get the job done\nBut to me that starts to cry counseling and the message that he kept on the team we took over really\nUm every year at spring training you talked about being a family of being connected and you know you see a kind of work itself or the DNA of the team for up to see them and it certainly has with this group a council the head of that steak I Believe and [noise] you know the young players just\nFrom a tipping point they don't seem to care who's standing in the batter's box they just let it rep and um you saw rented waterfront Orban burns the great joys and not have been great all year um\nSo the great they're great all year um and was able to close that you know yesterday's though doesn't matter who's on the roster everybody's finding a way to pretty\nGrim ... joining us from Colorado one of the I don't say unsung heroes and one of the guys you don't hear a lot about his worst pitching coach Derrick Johnson the job he has done with this pitching staff boy if there's an award for for a pitching coach I Would think he'd have to be the guy\n... you know they're kind of um some heroes when things go well and they're sometimes it goes what they don't do well um but you know what the Bruins have been able to piece together with the hope that it did it serves that there's a lot of credit as well they have in the back into their book then several\nGuys do miss bats so when he talked about playoff baseball this can be a rally or that does it in a heartbeat\nThe brewers both in Iraq a strike out they deal with can able

theory against the Braves during the regular season they lost the theories against the Dodgers like it was three wins in seven games again Los Angeles for women to seven games against Atlanta\nUm anything that advances that the the feel confident or are they the Dodgers are Supreme late sounded as compared to the Braves Atlanta got last night\nOr if they've got the weapons and the wind up ... that's the scary in in my opinion\nBut one of the members have been able to beat them you know they perform rather well on the road LA with all of the side of the Twenty one run outpouring against the brewers though are the kind of kept that aside but at the doctors are better human life than even the Braves but hopefully Atlanta can push the like\nGreg ... travels back to us before we like Greg

suggests they don't have credibility on the issue and while I Know almost half the population loves anything that disrespectful bastions of president\nIncluding now the latest piece of this is anyone who is a Republican or conservative is automatically tied to the president's even though you could say over and over again I don't agree with everything the president does but yet everything the

but a lot of them voted for him\nIt's just the way it is nothing absolutes whether it's believing in the principles of our president whether it's leaving in the conduct of our president or even his

revoke near there debating tonight you can see it right on a regular W TMZ TV because\nAt six PM it say chance I think for voters in Wisconsin to kind of figure out the candidates\nThe most recent polling suggests that a state senator leader who has been challenged uh in the numbers to beat Tammy Baldwin the one of the earlier polls couple of months ago so I guess it was a dead heat that has changed now there's a if you believe some polls as much as a double digit gap between the two candidates\nAnd or as somebody who's been a critic of US Senator Tammy Baldwin for her inactivity and inaction during her tenure rubber first term [noise] I think what should I could be\nAnd how this could play out as a chance for states there'll be a book where to point out something loudly and clearly to voters\nNow I understand that about forty seven percent of the population is going to vote for Tammy Baldwin she could light somebody on fire and that still would be the case so I'm excluding those people from the conversation because they're they're all in\nBut one of the things I've noticed about us center Tammy Baldwin is she's very good at the prepared statements is very good at the advertising campaign related to camp to running a campaign\n[noise] she's less effective when she has to speak or ... or when she was challenged on a subject and you know what we know what the issues are rights immigration\nConduct of the president's healthcare big one\nThat's going to be what they're going to be talking about tonight and I encourage\nThe moderators to ask tough questions and not let Tammy Baldwin orderly a booth near rely on talking points no one is served by that it's often the second question or the follow up the gets to the heart of the matter because both of these candidates\nWill have memorized their own talking points they've done enough campaign stops they know what the what they usually say we're asking about whatever topic is ... has come up with this immigration healthcare [noise] the role of government all that\nPush these candidates to come up with specifics push Tammy Baldwin\nTo get off the talking points and actually tell us what she would do other than that you get a car you get a car you get healthcare you get healthcare which is unrealistic not going to happen\nAnd it's so disingenuous to voters should throw it to the curb because it really makes no sense there was a stark difference between these two candidates\nWon favors a government that\nWants to do that or they feel they should do everything for citizens in other fields the

American do some can do better than men can do\n\nBut the notion that you're going to engineer kids to be less aware of their gender I I don't know if that's a good thing\nThere's boys and girls and men and women those labels are bad\nSomebody there are some people in our society would think there are bad but does that make that writes one of the central set of isn't a point to not separate the genders I don't think it's a good thing to separate also don't think it's a good thing to force kids to do something that they don't want to do to try to teach them\nWhat the other gender is supposedly likes to do not all boys like to climb trees out all girls like to paint her nails so aren't you aren't you as guilty of\nPigeon holding those kids the same way by choosing those activities to make that distinction I think you are and that could be equally as dangerous\n\nAs fundamental fact of it is we can all do better than how we relate to each other boys and girls men and women but engineering how we do that's it's probably just as dangerous as the current method and as I've said things take time to sort themselves out\nAt some points in the future\nMaybe mental treat women better that's a hopeful way to look at it because they certainly haven't done that to this point\nBut I think trying to fix this by a forced system that separate\nThe two genders and then tries to teach them skills of the other sects I think is frankly kind of silly more next right near WGM Jay\n... by saying no would you home you might say house cars [noise]\nFive and my aunt guy from home

... around the country you're demonized for having different opinions about policy\nI think you're absolutely right so as I can conservatives are going to throw the thought um we are demonized\nBut I I think ... half the country or more than half the country agrees with our viewpoint the problem though is you have liberal media um that kind of controls the narrative you have a liberal canceled town how the what you have liberal social media\nUm tech companies um you have the deep state or you have academia you so you have all these institution who don't agree with our viewpoint and also don't believe in free thinking and we thought they believe in a one size fits all which is the progressive\nThought process but when you started to talk about policy it's amazing so many Americans so

I always have brute fever so [laughter] so ah but yeah it does feel like the Green Bay area is more into this came than they were the tone eleventh him and I I Love the ... eleven team too so I Can't pick between my children but yes it does feel like maybe [noise] maybe it's because the Packers\nAre struggling a little bit that ah that for fever is so strong up here but it's great to see the whole state rally behind what's just been an awesome run and hopefully continue for a while\nIt is and I think you're right on your theory in terms of the Packers All right let's start with and I see this up a few moments ago\nI think conventional wisdom right now and I agree with that is of the Republican base was more energized with the end product of the ... circus and it certainly was a circus I don't know that that necessarily stays though through November the election and here's the way I put it a few minutes ago mark\nIs I think the global success fades more quickly than the bitterness of defeat what I'm referring to Democrats so I don't know who's going to be more energized by this when it's time to go to the polls and then you have to factor in early voting so what's your take\n... ... well I I think you're right Gerry you know I think unfortunately rightly\nOr wrongly anger much greater motivator than pleasure and politics and we see that over and over again I think is frankly one of the reasons why\nIf there is a democratic enthusiasm advantage this year it's because they're so angry at what's happening with President Trump and I think obviously you saw that in reverse than twenty time when Republicans were really angry about what President Obama was doing so\nI think we've seen through history that anger motivates more I think the Kavanaugh hearings certainly to galvanize Republicans in a way that we haven't seen a for some time or buy\nA four weeks is a long way to go and I'm not sure how many people are going to remember all that for weeks from now but you're right though I mean modern a voting is a much longer process and then one day\nYou know somewhere probably around a third Wisconsin voters are going to cast their ballot well before election day if not more that that that number is just that share of early votes is just growing and growing so maybe you'll see some of that\nBut I think in general I think if we're looking at\nWhich team is more mad I think I think you're going to the Fillmore anger I'm Democrat side in the Republican\nSide and I don't think Republicans help themselves on that in a couple of friends I I just I'm going to be very honest share\nI think they said some stupid things and make the president initially you know try to do that one of a better term decades himself but now saying they were all lying and and that they should be held liable for the things that they said\n... above Brett Kavanaugh I think that was on the helpful and I think just a number of things that were better left unsaid I just think\nThey don't necessarily know Grassley saying women don't want to work hard enough then you can argue whether he was taken out of context\nTo be on the Judiciary Committee and so on I think there were a number on forest errors that are feeding that anger\nAh yeah I imagine that [laughter] unfortunate that we've seen that quite a bit over the last a year\nOr two a particularly with Republicans and I agree I mean there was\nKevin always confirmed that was what Republicans were pushing for the idea is sort of take a victory lap didn't feel necessary and and I think again it's just gonna stir the anger on the left\nA and I think you're going to the forces on the left to try to use that to their political advantage and you already see that happening now and I think you're going to see that over the next four weeks especially as am at\nAt women voters where the Republicans already have a pretty massive disadvantage\nAnd I think the card and they will probably play as we're talking with a Republican strategist mark ... a is actually a probably a couple of them not so much\nThe allegations per se but one his temperament during that the cheering the reopening of the hearing and I ... I I don't know how you feel mark but I think it's pretty obvious he was less than honest about his drinking pass and I think those two things are going to really hone in on\nYeah I mean I think clearly there was a lot of emotion that came from now justice Kavanaugh during that hearing and I think some of it was was well placed I mean if somebody would say I mean these kinds of accusations against me and and I\nDid not feel as if I did the my if I thought that they were dishonest I I Would feel that way too so I think some of that link to his authenticity but I think he did hurt his credibility\nWith some of its responses as it related to his drinking and liking of beer or but I think that there are parts that hearing though that that helped in terms of\nOf moving that discussion away from what were some pretty serious a accusations of sexual assault\nAnd focus more on okay what do teenagers do and what did the ... their yearbook change mean and things like that and I think that frankly is the part that galvanized sort of that Trump coalition if you will\nTo say All right now we're we're picking out this guy's your book I'm a shorthand\nYour book I'm a shorthand so I I

seven nine nine one six twenty to find the link to vote\nSo arguing with Wisconsin Republican strategist mark rural a couple of things I Want to finish up on at least for the moment are on the cabinet confirmation mark congressman Duffy Sean Duffy says something well I I found interesting to see ... this morning a double duty I'm Jay\nAnd basically what he told Steve is congressman Duffy says look in terms of credibility twin Dr poured and now justice Kavanaugh he thought it was a tie and he said the tie should go to the guy that led an exemplary life\nMoment when I heard that because the immediate response there was going to be what's he saying about Dr Ford what's your thoughts on that\nWell I mean I think I understand what are you saying there and I think it was the reason he ultimately got confirmed it I think a lot of people struggled\nWith who do you believe because I Do think they were both very credible I think it is fair to say that you you ... you is there some way that you can believe them both right that they both believe exactly what they're saying is true\nBut I think what congressman Duffy and others are tainted listen there was no other cooperating evidence\nFor Dr Ford in fact the people who she identified as being there all said yeah no we don't remember anything like that happening including\nAnd on and on and on all of the things that had been heard before these are all tired\nPolitical sauce\nAnd they ... they didn't work and then you had senator Kamala Harris\nDr video she clip the piece of video to take it out of contacts and make it sound as though Brett Kavanaugh was saying something about birth control but he wasn't as George Will I was I Believe put it\nIn another place in another time in other words in the pre Trump the an era there would be no talk of her running for president and twenty twenty\nWould be if she would be toast if you think I'm wrong about that Joe Biden was stumbled in Nineteen eighty seven for the Nineteen eighty eight presidential election over ... some\nAllegation oh how quaint that sounds today but now what she did which would have been a felony back then is that that's a misdemeanor or civil forfeiture like Jay walking or a parking ticket\nCompared to other things going on that doesn't mean it isn't really bad and I'm not saying it is a really bad I Am just talking about context here\nThat's the reality that we live in Glen the criticism leveled at Senator Dianne Feinstein\nHe's valid here's we should have happened limited any member of Congress learned about these allegations they should have gone directly to the FBI\nUnderstand these allegations were brought to a member of Congress when Kavanaugh was still on the shortlist not the nominee which by the way I think gives credibility to the doctor for it\nShe did it as soon as she knew that he was a contender she didn't wait until he was the pet\nI actually think this was extremely difficult I think she is credible and I have a theory that a lot of people aren't going to like which I'll get to in a moment\nBut Feinstein\n... I'm Sorry the allegations that she tried to use this as a nation to hold when the conventional weapons failed and then she went to the nuclear arsenal now I Know I understand that I'm not saying that there isn't some validity to the argument that the doctor forward have requested anonymity but somehow some way this had to go to the FBI sooner\nDr Ford head it'd be sold look he's got a notice or not even the FBI or to notice about him\nBecause what would have happened then now with President Trump who knows but there's a pretty good chance he would have been the nominee we don't know that and again with Trump that may or may not have met a disqualifying\nRevelation will we will never know\nSo all of those things are true\nWhen here's I Will tell you might take when she gave her testimony and then she was question\nI was in my immediate trackers dot org office when my employee\nWe're both live streaming it and we said he's toast I she's highly believable they the vagaries in her story not withstanding she's highly credible then she came on\nAs a more articulate more educated\nDonald Trump with a law degree but that split he presented\nAnd Republican voters have been waiting for decades for someone to fight back so they loved that\nYes I Know she didn't know where to place and I know all of that\nBut here's what sticks with me\nWhy lie about an attempted rape and not a raped because she's making all of this up why not say he raped me\nWhy put a witness in the room that most likely will not corroborate your story\nNone of that\nMakes any sense to me\nSo here's the theory probably nobody's quite LA but I've got a proper it anyway I Can't say I believe it I think it's possible here's what I Do believe\nThat cabinet did not tell the truth about his drinking as a youth we can get into a prolonged debate about whether that's relevant what is relevant is whether or not he lied about it in the here and now as a nominee\nThat's that's just the reality\nI have a theory again\nI Believe he was lying about that\nBecause I Believe he was lying about that I Believe it's possible that this happened and he doesn't remember it nothing from mad like happen for him\nOther than it ended if she's telling the truth\nWhen mark judge jumped on both of them\nAnd by the way she said mark judge didn't do anything to help her I'm not so sure I agree with that that might in fact if she's telling the truth be what that act is\nIt's entirely possible he's that vehement because he really doesn't believe it\nBut setting all of that aside\nThere is no need for Republicans to go over the top with the rhetoric\nThat isn't something to women and beyond the political dynamics it's just not the right thing to do\nThat as my far more than two cents on it if you have anything you
