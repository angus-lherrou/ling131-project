I'm On a certain amount of ... like you don't have that in their budget issue as well\nGet higher is yeah you know twenty Thirty Years' experience and here you have I\nOnly have maybe ... ... what kind of a mortar fire man or you're creating there that can create a lot of problems too\nWell but and then you have it but see that what you're saying Julie ... then that's just kind of ... blush for for discrimination because that that's almost always going to be the case if you reach a certain point you're in your fifties or maybe your early sixties\nChances are if you go to a new place you're probably going to find a supervisor who's younger is far that's just kind of the ... so I mean if that's the case then I mean new older Americans could ever be discriminated against because they're always going to be working for somebody the junk or the narrow correct but\nThen maybe somebody who had twenty or thirty ... right maybe they shouldn't be applying\nFor those jobs or or no no I I see 'cause my my argument would be that that you know obviously you as the older\nEmployee you know as the person their fifties or sixties you have a responsibility to adapt to the to the culture and if you come in and say with the attitude of I Know more than my supervisor or whatever that creates an issue at\nWould only add it could but you know it could be and\nAnd that perhaps is a reason for saying look this isn't working out after they try it I guess I just don't and that's maybe even a reason\nTo some question you ask for an interview process are you sure you really want to to do this you know you've you've had these high level type of jobs but I just don't think you should be able to simply say no just because the supervisor was forty and you're sixty you're not going to get the job\nRight I agree with you I guess it hurts knowing\nYou know maybe it'll all their mark it shouldn't be that way right right under somebody who has what I really shouldn't be that the dynamic but he didn't happen and then of course they create a really bad environment right well I don't think they know what they're doing and I tried to come in here in LA\nWell I mean the ... and thanks I mean it but it in that case I mean it gets like I say if if they're turns out to be an actual you know ... that happens you know that happens all the time and I guess my my my only point is that after you've done so I've been I've been here for Twenty years All right so it's it's not surprising that the people\nYou know our our program director each um group than I Am you know that's that's the deal you know a lot of the management staff is younger than I Am and has less experience but it's all it is that's I think that that's the whole thing that you have to kind of work stuff out there and if you are the older employee\nThe you you have to be willing to say okay well there's there's new ways that you're going to do certain stuff and you have to be open to that and you can't just dig in your heels and say no I've been doing this this is how we did it twenty five years ago and this is how we're always going to do it well that's a recipe for failure but at the same time\nSimply because you've got more experience and say you were a supervisor I mean look what when I was in the U.S attorney's office it was a supervisor and\nI was younger than some of the people that I was supervising and I don't know and I had less experience I guess in some of the people I was supervising but it's just something that you you you know figure out a way to work out again I\nI don't know how this particular law suits going to turn out there's some there's some interesting legal issues as to what does the law say who can bring lawsuits and stuff like that but I Do think this is one of the recurring issues that we're facing in our society namely the fact that there is\nI think sometimes subtle sometimes less subtle discrimination against people as they get older and it's one of the huge undercover story so that does it out there\n[noise]\n... series of dreams [noise] interesting in my opinion very Under Cover ... going\nOn in Milwaukee city hall if you have Tom Barrett who was of course the new mayor\nAnd Tom Barrett has various department heads who he has nominated the common council approved some but the date ... in essence report to the mayor right he the mayor is is the boss and we've seen some of these department heads have done a\nCrummy job the health department has been an absolute mess for the last several years you've got the whole problem you know with lead in the water and all that type stuff it\nIt it's been a problem but the mayor eat is ultimately because the mayor is the elected official the mayor is responsible and it is possible to voters if voters get upset about the way you know a particular that the city is being run if they take it out on on the mayor and the department heads have reported to him\nThe common council\nWhich has the ability to approve you know say yes or no department heads the common council in Milwaukee is now sort of flexing its muscles and what they wanted to do is they wanted to create\nA position of an inspector general and the inspector general would be located in the clerk's office\nAnd the inspector general would essentially\nSoup last supervised but would have the ability to oversee and monitor the various departments that are under the control of Tom Barrett okay circles that breaking news\nWe have a large fire near chasing Oklahoma this is the recycling center according to Milwaukee fire and this is a big one there is black smoke that can be seen for miles and want to bring you a little bit of sound I got from I just spoke with the settlement on the phone and he is describing where he is seeing right now in the south side of Milwaukee\nSo I got on the highway and walks John I Ninety or editing or a downtown Milwaukee and from the highway rising up on the tree is just the giant oil flow of black smoke eating into the air and it looks like it's somewhere\nMaybe towards the south side of Milwaukee maybe by the late but it is so huge that gets ...\nMaybe a little bit of a low cater again I Know you have if you're asking you to repeat your eyes so at this me talking to him is severe chasing Oklahoma again on the south side near the airport\nAre recycling fire according to Milwaukee fire when we spoke with the fire chief deputy fire chief Melissa we're speaking with him while they were still responding so we don't know yet the significance of this fire but again any large fire near a recycling center and chasing Oklahoma right now in the south side\nAnd you couple that with all the other traffic nest that's going on and it is an absolute nightmare All right we'll have an update in just a couple of minutes of that but if you're wondering what the black ... is well I saw some of the pictures of it is it looks like\nIt's a recycling fire is what it is but it there's black smoke visible from all over we'll give you an update about what's going on there and just one finished my thought about this inspector general comment council wants inspector general to be located in the clerk's office to essentially\nWell they would have the power to investigate the various departments that are out there well that's the last thing Tom Barrett was inspector general looking over his department and he's worried that it could be a political weapon\nThe he vetoed the common council's resolution to comment council overrode his veto so now you've got a ... inspector general\nWho will be located in the clerk's office reviewing the work of the mayor this is not going to end well All right it's two fifty four when we come back we'll find out what's on the agenda for

hackers sweat shirts today so ... says different sorry last night for the brewers yet the Packers were talking about all that you can just sick if I have a broader question they ask for it you knew he would occasionally a can live sporting events or direct here as a general rule [noise]\nDo you do you stay till the end of the game ever since I've become a father of young children almost never almost\nNever because you've got you got to get home yeah can't usually we see the uh the sausage race and then I tried to convince them early\nOkay if if it were not though for childcare responsibilities oh you have to be right I mean nobody you know you now now All right um if you think back on games that you you went to maybe where it was a blowout whether it's football or baseball blowouts one way or the other is sometimes you know you you're leaving the sixth or seventh inning\nSure yeah and football games you know if it's if it said blowouts\nYeah you know your your team is ahead or losing by Seventeen or twenty four points\nBecause no you wouldn't occur to you even though you had to drive home today you know and even though he had to drive home last night to get to to Franklin you were going to leave you wouldn't leave with four minutes left in the game was tied right\nWhy am I Can't come out [laughter] no [laughter] no I work with but it'll suck it up for [laughter]\nThat's another ... days ago and now you can you can send him that's all right though that that that's it he's got broad shoulders and when you leave a Packers game Heather Heather dissing you they're they're grew All right but\nYou deserve it that's the bottom OK here's why bring this all up because I I Love the Green Bay Packers I Do I Do I Do and I am a huge brewers fan for me it was it was brewers and again that this is the way I did it I mean I was in India and\nUm and I was I had actually I had on the Internet up I had like the play by play go into a major league baseball site or whatever so I I could see what was happening when I Would flick over to the Packers but but the brewers where my primary watched thing\nBecause again we were in special territory here I mean this is\nThat the brewers what they've been in the national league championship series you got to go back to what twenty eleven\nThey've only they haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two no I'm I mean I'm watching playoff baseball in October no disrespect to the Packers I'm a huge Packers fan but I I Would check in when again between innings and things like that I was I was brewer's all the way\nWhich surprises me to an extent is the numbers are out\nAnd those of us for whom the brewers were the primary ... the we're watching the brewers primarily the TV we were in the minority now there there is a cavity here and that is this the brewers won Fox Sports one so you you needed to have\nCable or the ability the live stream or something they weren't on the over your broadcast\nThe Packers were on channel twelve and they were on ESPN so theoretically there's a larger number of people who watch the Packers but here are the Hillary numbers according to the journal sentinel the brewers four to nothing victory over the Dodgers\nHad an average twenty five point three household rating is pretty big meaning two hundred and fourteen thousand plus households were tuned to the game on the other hand the Packers they had a I'm thirty three point seven\nCombined rating from a again channel twelve and ESPN so user to platforms you could watch them on\nBut they uh they did it again the brewers numbers were twenty five point three Packers numbers were thirty three point seven that translates into about two hundred and eighty six thousand washers so the Packers drew\nI don't know somewhere around Seventy thousand more households in the Milwaukee area that we're watching them and candidly that surprises me that surprises me a lot\nBecause it is in fact playoff baseball and of course you also have the Packers just um well I mean let's face it this year's Packer team is struggling even though yesterday's game was great\nI I went with the with the brewers as my primary but for those of us who did\nWe were apparently in the minority which again demonstrates that this is a great baseball area but football continues to be somewhat of a religion so more people watch the Packers be curious to see if there's other conflicts whether or not that continues to be the case is the brewers march\nThrough the playoff continues which is what we're going to discuss when we come back\nThe Milwaukee Brewers team they can't get any respect stick around it's called twenty seven ...

T. M. J. hello\nHi I'm ... my husband and I buy and sell them for a certain part of that one mhm hardly ... for like ... but it wasn't right and that's not even pronounce ain't great and I\nAnd there are much shortly after the game I said like I had a rough howling right there were first dating site yet again and like a you know a lot of it around and\nAnd see I I bet you most of those people never watch brewers game during the course of the year because you all you do is you watch the Yankees and the red Sox and and but you know the Los Angeles team I I was I was\nNever watch brewers game during the course of the year because you all you do is you watch the Yankees and the red Sox and and you know the Los Angeles team I I was I was in Europe last week but somebody was telling me you know Bob Costas apparently kept calling 'em\nAggie are ... or something like that yeah\nThat's right exactly I Know I I I I Know\nYou've got rhyme you out right Brian interesting yep yep and I think might even out here I don't think I just can't get around\nUm I think it was the granite so that to my best friend and her favorite part of life you might be just ecstatic at some point\nIt is a great story you know you're right you're right it it's it's\nA great story I mean it really is this kind of David and Goliath thing but again I there's this huge larger markets biased it's out there\nAnd I I think a lot of these people don't follow the team but never followed the team so what they do is they get their little like sheets that the producers laid out for them and they read the stuff off at no it's the thanks ... dress I mean I [laughter]\nIf if you were driving past me on the freeway was I'm going home or something\nAnd you find myself like east it looks like I'm yelling at the radio that's because I'm yelling at the radio because again I have some national commentator from serious or something that's just talking about oh I don't think the brewers are going to be able to hit this guy and\nYou know they and they they don't like the way council plays the game they might respect gray council but they don't like the idea that oh you you're bringing these pictures and they get a couple of thousand times\nThat's not how it's done the teams that win the world series or the teams that have the great starting pitching in and this this new revolution oldest is just this new trendy thing and you know Clinton crush all the great Dodger his picture on his way to the whole thing he's going to dominate the brewers that's going to be a quick to wins where are they going to get the other ones and\nThey don't even acknowledge this clueless and is that they're just wrong they don't appreciate\nHow good this team isn't yes if I sound a little frustrated and I sound like inventing that's exactly what I Am doing here's attacks thank you yes yes yes yes absolutely no reflection I don't know how to pronounce pronounce names only reliever they can talk about his hater and then to question councils decisions on when to use the EMS\nThere's no question that that is a possibility brewers need to win two more games but yesterday was a big win and candidly the brewers have out played the Dodgers all three games like I said earlier were it not for\nOne bad pitch and the second bad ending you know the brewers are going on for a sweet now don't expect here that if you listen to national media but we know that it is the case so games for\nTonight or maybe the best thing to do and maybe maybe that's what I just need to do is therapy and that is to to stop listening to the national media and just perspective what's going on here in Milwaukee is very very special and of course you can hear the game this evening on double duty I'm Jay alright I feel a little bit better now that identity\nSo thank you for joining me in my event called fifty five ... WTO O. J.\nJet fighter WGM Jay Z ad from\nFor Governor Walker for former Governor Tommy Thompson Scott Walker has have really bad but it's something that stuff on Twitter that I I Will play for you\nIt's only Twenty one seconds long in the next hour I think I think if it's not an ad it should be an ad 'cause I think\nIt is incredibly powerful are Wisconsin I so wrapped up in the brewers postseason run the thoughts of the upcoming election are getting pushed aside is there anything candidates can do to stay on top of mind uh let's see gene Miller\nWill have a discussion of that tomorrow morning on Wisconsin's morning news All right when we come back we're going to talk about the Walker at but we start off\nCourse face and tiny the latest developments stick around just when you thought it couldn't get stranger it hats twelve fifty a chip away at your WTO O. J. [noise]\n\n... pm Jay very glad to have you with us I I understand before about faith and make some people's heads explode and I apologize for that in advance but I think the last couple of weeks [noise] I think President Trump has been\nDoing a pretty darn good job at getting some attention obviously getting getting Brett Kavanaugh\nFor the U.S Senate narrowly but still getting him through\nHuge huge accomplishment I think you know Trump is taking the right tone if you look at the\nAh his his approach to trade wars which you know and I'm I'm not a fan of getting into trade wars but his let's talk tough attitude has I think done well I think it brought Kennedy and and I think you've got a deal that's percolating that's going to be a lot better\nFor the United states than the NAFTA was a truck through the reports are he's raised over a hundred million dollars for his reelection campaign I I think it's\nBeen even his staunchest opponents would have to acknowledge that it's\nBeen a couple good weeks now even when you had the stock market just go into the dumpster for two days yesterday yeah last week you know you had your Trump was blaming the Federal Reserve for that and I think that might have gotten some traction by the way\nFor for everybody who who panics when there's a bad day in the market one of the reasons why all the financial advisors tell you that you've got to be in it for the long haul and you can't panic\nIs because for every day like there were two days last week which admittedly were brutal there's days like today Dow Jones right now is up four hundred and Seventy seven points\nThe NASDAQ is up a hundred and Ninety two points percentage wise that's two point six percent increase and here's the thing if you panic after a bad it's it's why financial analysts all say\nYou have to be in this for the long run\nBecause if you react to a particular day in the market\nAnd you get out oh my God the stock market went down fourteen hundred points over a three day period they look and I understand\nBelieve me I understand how frustrating that as but if you panic and he spoke at I'm getting out of the stock market I'm going to I don't know take all my money in cash and put her under the bed or whatever\nYou end up missing days like today where you know the Dow is up four hundred and Seventy points who knows where it's going to finish in the NASDAQ up a hundred and eighty eight points if if you pull out your money do you miss those big days that's why they say over time you end up you know whether your bowl or a bear over time you you end up\nMaking money in the stock market but you you can't react to what happens on a given day and and today is again the the indicator that\nYou know if people would have panicked and pulled a large chunk of their money out of the stock market based on what happened a couple of days last week you would miss market rallies like this and I'm just saying All right so any event I think\nPresident Trump has had a good couple weeks as a general rule\nAt the same time he still has a tendency to I don't know hick fights that are absolutely beyond me and I want to discuss something's going on now if you turn on the talk and get shows tonight you will see a lot of it\nAll right Stormy Daniels and her sleazy lawyer Michael avid daddy Stormy Daniels is of course the pornographic film actress who says back in two thousand seven I was reading some report describing her as as as President Trump's alleged mistress she wasn't his mistress\nHer story as he is at a golf tournament she's at a golf tournament they have sex one night that that's that that is not to me a mistress it would be a one night stand although if you believe her it does not sound like they were standing very much so that's the deal\nPresident Trump of course denies it happened if it did happen\nI don't know I I'm not sure President Trump has the ability to have a lot of self reflection but at some point in time in the middle night if it did in fact happened he's got to be regretting that it did because Stormy Daniels who is the greatest publicity hound since Barnum and Bailey\nAnd of course one of the most dangerous places to be in the United states now a days just between Stormy Daniels are her real name is Stephanie Clifford\nA camera and she travels across the country trying to again give her her career as a strip club entertainer or a boost and but she she shows off because she's a woman who says she slept with President Trump Bob Bob getting all these different stories and get the publicity well anyhow at one point in time Stephanie Clifford Case Stormy Daniels\nFiles a defamation lawsuit against President Trump right now\nI'm not exactly sure under the circumstances\nGiven the fact that she is a publicity hound to the extreme I'm not sure how you could exactly defame her but at the bottom line was this defamation lawsuit was thrown out by it\nDream I'm not sure how you could exactly defame her but at the bottom line was this defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge\nYesterday right throat so President Trump has one now I Would argue that if you are the leader of the free world\nThere's really nothing to gain from what I'm going to call punching down you know engaging with\nA pornographic film actress who says that the two of you had sex ten or eleven years ago and it gets I'm One of these people that argue the quicker than the Stormy Daniels becomes a a small footnote in history the better it will be but\nPresident Trump was not satisfied with simply winning the lawsuit\nSo today he sent out a tweet here's what the tweet from ... real Donald Trump says federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to fully legal fees ... Fox at Fox News great now I can go after horse face\nAnd her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total card\nSo he tweets about his case this case being dismissed and calls stormy Daniels' case Stephanie Clifford horse\nFace All right at which point in time um this brings out a couple of responses Michael ... who is kind of the sleazy lawyer\nThat represents Stephanie Clifford he sends out a tweet saying\nYou are discussing the ... and an embarrassment to the United states bring everything you have because we're going to demonstrate to the world with a complete Traister and a liar you are how many other women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home each week All right and then\nThe former adult film star this would be Stormy Daniels herself she weighs in ladies and gentlemen may I present your president in addition to his own shortcomings he has demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women and the lack of self control on Twitter again\nAnd perhaps a penchant for beef theology game on tiny okay so\n[noise] we now have the president of United States calling this pornographic film actress or space\nWe have her lawyer hitting back and we now have her talking about the president once again and his ... and the tail yeah All right for one for seven nine nine when six twenty minutes he acted mortgage talk and text line\nI don't know about you\nWho looks in the mirror every morning and seizures herself as the president of the United states and she's she's about as far to the left as as you\nCan get without I mean completely Clark crossing over into the the full blown socialist aspect and she wants to be president desperately she has been dogged by claims over the years that she has made claiming Native American ancestry and\nAnd this is this has caused President Trump to mockery calls her Pocahontas and she doesn't like being called Pocahontas and a lot of people kind of roll their eyes because Elizabeth Warren\nIs a very very white woman and that comes from the perspective of a talk show hosts the very very white guy All right now I suspect if you trace my genealogy back\nGenerations and generations and generations and generations and generations\nMaybe somewhere along the line you could\nFind some tied to some ... ethnicity or a minority group or something like that maybe if you go back far enough I mean at the end of the day if you believe in Adam and Eve for example well we all traced back to either at Emory if you know that that just kind of the way it works if you go back far enough\nSo Elizabeth Warren yesterday who again she wants to very much to be president\nXi announces that she has she had her DNA tested\nAnd the DNA shows that well her or report says that there is strong evidence that the senator had a Native American somewhere in her family tree dating back six to ten generations\nSix to ten generations so this means if you accept is it is accurate it means that Elizabeth Warren is somewhere between one sixty four and one on one hand rich fat between\nOne sixty one sixty fourth and one one hundred thousand and twenty fourth\nNative American depending on how distant the relative yes so it it's again you've got to go back six to ten generations best case scenario she's one sixty fourth Native American\nWorst case scenario one one thousand and twenty four but\nBy any stretch of the imagination whether there is some tiny trace of again Native American DNA and her ancestry it's not like she has any sort of\nIn a common experience with the Native American experience you know in America in two thousand Eighteen ... any well since she came out with this she has been mocked\nBy both Republicans and Democrats um of course you know President Trump hasn't backed down on this number of the Republicans are pointing out\nThat okay here here she might be one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American and and she's saying okay this this shows that I have some degree of Native American ancestry a number of\n... Native Americans are saying some teeny tiny portion of DNA six to ten generations\nAgo doesn't mean that you're Native American and it doesn't mean that you can relate to the experience and a number of Democrats are saying oh my goodness why would you do something like this a few weeks before the midterms when you know now this\nAll this is going to do for for example Jim Messina is the former president former campaign manager of President Obama in two thousand twelve he says argue the substance all you want\nBut why twenty two days before a crucial election where Democrats must win house and Senate to save America why did Senator Warren has to do or announcement today why can't Democrats ever stay focused\nRight for one for seven nine nine one six and by the way a number of members native\nAmerican tribes or denouncing this as well as like what what does what does this mean somewhere generations and generations and generations or do there there might be a tiny bit of in this case Native American blood in in your in your background\nIs what what if instead of again the Native American claim\nWhat if this was well we couldn't find maybe some you know African blood or your claim that does that mean that Elizabeth Warren has some sort of significant tied to people who were enslaved in the Seventeen hundreds for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the ac unit mortgage talk and tax wise\nI guess I I I looked at this shook my head because\n[noise] going back six to ten generations in an effort to try to claim that you know you somehow can relate to the problems of a particular group and this case Native Americans I think it's just absolutely ridiculous I think Elizabeth Warren\nOver her career has been\nAn opportunist I'm On a level of some other prominent opportunists and this idea that here she's going to try to put to questions put to rest questions or ethnicity by releasing something like this\nI just don't think people care and candidly I think it makes her look ridiculous for one for seven nine nine when six twenty than the mortgage talk and text line\nWas this a mistake by Elizabeth Warren are are people going to somehow say oh okay ten generations ago there might have been some\nNative American DNA well okay now we understand the claims that she can relate to the problems of the Native American community because she's got some Native American blood really for one for seven nine nine one six twenty we discuss in just a moment it's one forty to this is Jeff regular like I say I I think if you go back\nFar enough I my guess is you you can you can find almost anybody that has I don't know some sort of DNA that came from somewhere where one four seven nine one six forty it's one forty three we're back to discuss in just a moment if you're on the line please hold on\nOne forty six or WTO O. J. C. to me\nThe three we're back to discuss in just a moment if you're on the line please hold on\nOne forty six years I'll be tempted to me with with Elizabeth Warren did yesterday demonstrates that just sort of in title mentality in mentality that you see she puts out this this story saying All right I've had a DNA test and it shows that\nMaybe maybe somewhere between six to ten generations ago I might have had some Native American\nNative American blood All right so which and how does that\nWhat is that gain and actually one of the tribal spokesman says this isn't all about Elizabeth Warren using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely it's inappropriate in wrong Senator Warren undermines tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage I mean in what world\nDo we say hey I'm One sixty fourth this or I Am one one thousand and twenty four this so that means I somehow and part of that minority community and I understand it really for one for seven nine nine one six twenty a bill in Mount pleasant billiard there'll be team Jake good afternoon or good afternoon\nUh my wife we're just about this yesterday we are actually\nFunny my wife and I bought it at ... dot com right and my wife has actually Canadian citizen yeah uh but uh her her third generation great great great grandmother was\nActually a Native American so we know that you know I Do\nKnow that three generations ago not six generations okay got it\nIn a show that she was eight and nine and ... ... American or most people would have that are Native American our care to\nOh my pleasure because the care very straight there are always manage a dollar\nOr do you know but I really the whole point is that she's trying your something there that they\nHave the minority white\nYou know and ... which are showing how shallow you have to go to ...\nYeah ... it's at all you are is that I mean is that your whole it primarily\nWhat we'll wait right and also does that\nDoes that tie you in All right are are you familiar with that you can how do you relate to the Native American experienced by the fact of virtue that six to ten generations ago maybe you had a relative who\nYou know was was Native American and in some small part I mean it's just it's it's ridiculous I mean your wife I assume would not claimed that she can relate to the Native American experience which she\nWell no but you look like shit and now a guy\nThat they took a while I ... I thought well Liz miss Warren I I mean and look and this is from the perspective of a really wake die or Elizabeth Warren ... [noise]\nI don't think anybody would mistake Elizabeth Warren for somebody who grew up on on an American Indian reservation I just that's just not the case for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to Russell in Brookfield roughly or WTO O. J. lo\nOr I should get a tremendous amount of name recognition all across the country it's like going warrior\n... postures things they can get all those free publicity I'm being talked about and they just every time she has to do it just say something when we think it was like this and get free advertising it just ...\n... we do this occasionally 'cause it appears that just just just happened and we try to do this if you happen to be out and about in that area to tell you\nWhat you might be looking for what you might having to be dealing with because getting looks like it's a backup at least Phillies is thirty minutes so far for one for seven nine one six wanting to see I can in mortgage talk and text line\nUh we'll try to get you a couple of alternate routes as well to avoid completely ruining your day George George W T I'm David afternoon or\nGood afternoon what's going on\nA while I'm In the back and the traffic so what I Want to go forty three I a lot going down that way and then now on coming back or Illinois where\nIf there's no way to college avenue now okay I'm I'm by the Iraq and everybody's trying to get off\nAnd there's two lanes are actually in the tribe lane finally get off the freeway right\nRight so it it's not going anywhere and everybody's trying to get off the freeway which sounds like very good advice right now\nYeah on a three point that when I have an area over here and I'm a high end and Twenty one good way to get around it right\nBut if you don't like construction and it's great I got it okay\nUm Mexico I get the lesson is try to avoid this area for the foreseeable future Chris in Franklin ... good afternoon\nI'm good Chris ... I'm not driving in that area sounds like you are\nYeah I I hear Ryan road right yourself or a Brian road and you get off the highway why I'm a street\nThat in my life if you are listening that are\nGood enough okay good at the bottom line is major league backups I'm figuring alternative route\nEm thanks for the call let's see if it takes I came from seven mile road heading north on Ninety four there was a tomato and a small issue be up on the middle wall must have happened in the south side but they're on the middle wall oh\nI'm just got through the north bound lanes vehicle on top of the median concrete\nI'm absolutely alright than the number of squad cars as well I think there's another backup southbound on forty five is well we'll bring you continue updates on the traffic but there are some messages on the roadway so my advice is a kind of think about alternative routes if you have to be out about All right when\nWe come back if you are older and you're looking for a job\nAre you being discriminated against and when I tell you about a story and then we're going to discuss stick around to fourteen Jeff record there'll be tempting alright here here's the reality the recession or the number of years ago it\nImpacted a lot of people it costs a lot of people to to lay their retirement plans costs a lot of people to get down you know money to save for retirement they ended up spending if the kind of live and so a lot of people now maybe they're\nWorking longer than they had originally tempted to work\nIn addition what happened is during the recession a lot of people who were perhaps older ended up losing their jobs and I I think as much as as anybody it it's the people who are in maybe their fifties and sixties who had the most difficult time trying to get comparable type of jobs\nThere are law says that since lawyers cannot discriminate against people based on on their age and yet I think a lot of us\nThat those laws are very very difficult to enforce and that a lot of people are in fact discriminated based on their age let me give you a story this is the Chicago Tribune the other day ties fifty eight years old he he's a lawyer\nWith a link the record of success he's got decades of experience he was a general counsel at deans foods\nHe was the c._e._o. of a dairy products trade group\nAnd and he was trying to he lost that those jobs for whatever reason and he was trying to get something comparable couldn't get anything comparable so he decided well All right I I I'm not going to be\nIn a position where general counsel for some large company but you know what\nI I still do my stuff and I am not at the age of fifty eight I'm not ready to retire at this point in time\nI don't want to start drawing down my retirement money so what I'm going to do is I'm going to lower my expectations I Am going to work at a job that you only see beneath them that's not what I mean but he ... he arguably arguably overqualified for the job but you know what the heck yeah job is a job so he starts looking for\nCorporate counsel types of jobs and he finds his job to advertise it it's they're looking for a senior counsel position\nAt I'm a medical technology company\n... okay well it just looks like something that I I could perhaps do and then he comes across the at\nThe ad says looking for senior counsel\nFree to seven years experience but no more than seven years of relatively relevant legal experience so three to seven years no more than seven of relevant legal experience\nAnd the guy says wait a minute you know what what do you mean I understand minimum that you want okay somebody that's worked in the field three years of relevant legal experience that that's fine\nIn a minimum that you want okay somebody this work in the field three years of relevant legal experience that that's fine\nBut what do you mean no more than seven\nWhat should you care and what if I've got twenty five years of experience you know it it doesn't that make me arguably perhaps more qualified\nThan never got an interview because he has more than the seven years of relevant legal experiences and now he's turned around and and he he's filed a lawsuit saying this is late to lead this blatant age discrimination you know they're\nThey are saying that you know they they don't want somebody because by limited to somebody at the top end to a seven years of experience\nWith they're saying is we don't want anybody who is older we don't want anybody who has more experience and this is I think this is bringing up to this whole issue did a lot of older Americans are finding\nThat you go in for the these jobs and you know you're just not getting in the door because despite the fact the law says he can't discriminate against people based on age\nThat is precisely what is happening and maybe it's because employers\nWho offer health benefits recognized for somebody who is sixty maybe and I say maybe maybe statistically more likely to I don't know draw down on health benefits somebody who's Thirty years old\nMaybe it's because they figured that okay if you get the job of fifty five\nMaybe you're going only stayed eight to ten years whereas you know we're looking for somebody who's going to be a part of the company for decades you know we're we're better off going with somebody who's thirty five but this is I think in many respects a real problem\nThan older Americans are having as they jump into the job market now it's very very tough I guess to prove it but\nIn this particular case the guy saying hey I I've got I've got objective evidence of this\nThey're telling me that I Am essentially overqualified for this job who are they told me that I if I'm willing to do it what should it matter but they're really saying by putting a limit on the amount of experience is they don't want older more seasoned people\nThat want to open up the phone with our numbers for one for seven nine nine one six sweaty and dizzy accurate mortgage talk in text line\nI Will tell you this anecdotally\nMy sent and this is just from some conversations that I've had with people over the last several years that even in a job market\nWhere you know we're nearing full employment\nThat from the perspective of people who are older and again I'm Talking about in the fifties and sixties but not ready to retire and again willing and able to contribute\nThere there is an incredible anti slash old bias that is there\nAnd that you have employers maybe suddenly maybe not so suddenly who are sexually saying we're not interested in older workers\nHave you found that to be the case for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the acting mortgage talk in tech slide\nAnd again I mean I understand that there were a lot of jobs for example that have just disappeared that were occupied by people who might have been in their forties and fifties and in those jobs are gone and those jobs aren't coming back\nBut have you noticed a reluctance or do you believe there is a reluctance on the part of employers to hire people again who are in their fifties and sixties because despite what they might be willing to say the truth we just don't want to deal with\nOlder but you know not retiring Americans let's start with Diane ain't hills corners on WGM drink good afternoon\nHello yeah Hi Diana you're talking about my life story right now I'm really [laughter] [laughter]\nWe're not there was a nightmare oh why\nDon't the nightmare that's a better way of putting it I lost my job and October I still don't have a job I have applied to many many many times in between I had a number of interviews summer a good fit someone someone someone I got there I realized it wasn't what I Want it others I Would have liked the job and didn't get the offer\nThat were found many jobs that I Would have been perfect or it was like they were writing my description\nI never heard the word I turn\nRight I agree with you again I guess I had heard knowing\nYou know somebody made in our own and mark and it shouldn't be that way right right under somebody who has like I really shouldn't be that the dynamic but he didn't happen of course they create a really bad environment right well I don't think they know what they're doing and I'm trying to come and well I've had their ears experience All right\nWell I mean the ... and thanks I mean I'd put it in that case I mean it gets like I said if if they're turns out to be an actual you know\nAs that happens you know that happens all the time and I guess my my my only point is that after you've done so I've been I've been here for Twenty years All right so it's it's not surprising that the people\nYou know our our program director each um group than I Am you know that's that's the deal you know a lot of the management staff is younger than I Am and has less experience but it's all it's that's I think that that's the whole thing that you have to kind of work stuff out and if you are the older employee in\nThe ... you have to be willing to say okay well there's there's new ways to do certain stuff and you have to be open to that and you can't just digging your heels and say nope I've been doing this this is how we did at twenty five years ago and this is how we're always going to do it but that's a recipe for failure but at the same time\nSimply because you've got more experience than say you were supervisor I mean that was when I was in the U.S attorney's office it was a supervisor and I was younger than some of the people that I was supervising and I I don't know and I have less experience I guess in some of the people I was supervising but it's just something that you\nYou you know figure out a way to you know work out again I\nI don't know how this particular law suits going to turn out there's some there's some interesting legal issues as to what does the law say and who can bring lawsuits and stuff like that but\nI Do think this is one of the recurring issues that we're facing in our society namely the fact that there is I think sometimes subtle sometimes less subtle discrimination against people as they get older and it's one of the huge undercover stories about this is after\n[noise]\nM. J. series it rains [noise] interesting in my opinion very ... going\nOn in Milwaukee city hall you have Tom Barrett who was of course the the mayor and Tom Barrett\nHas various departments hats\nWho

health department has been an absolute mess\nFor the last several years you've got the whole problem you know it was led and the water and all that type stuff\nIt it it's been a problem but the mayor is ultimately because the mayor is the elected official\nThe mayor is responsible and and this was possible to the voters if voters get upset about the way you know a particular that the city is being run if they take it out on on the mayor and the department heads of report it to him the common council which\nHas the ability to approve you know say yes or no to department heads the common council in Milwaukee is now sort of flexing its muscles and what they wanted to do is they wanted to create a position of an inspector general\nAnd the inspector general would be located in the clerk's office and the inspector general would essentially\nSoup last supervised but would have the ability to oversee and monitor the various departments that are under the control of Tom Barrett okay there you go set breaking news\nWe have a large fire near chase in Oklahoma and this is we're recycling center according to Milwaukee fire\nAnd this is a big one there is black smoke that can be seen for miles and want to bring you a little bit of sound I got from it I just spoke with the settlement on the phone when he is describing where he is seeing right now in the south side of Milwaukee\nSo I got on the highway and walk Sean I Ninety or editing or a downtown Milwaukee and from\nThe highway rising up on the tree is just the giant oil flow of black smoke eating into the air and it looks like it

absolute nightmare All right we'll have an update in just a couple of minutes of that but if you're wondering what the black ... is well I saw some of the pictures of it is it looks like\nIt's a recycling fire is what it is but if there's black smoke visible from all over we'll give you an update about what's going on there and just wanna finish my thought about this inspector general\nComment council wants inspector general to be located in the clerk's office to essentially well they would have the power to investigate the various departments that are out there well that's the last thing Tom Barrett was inspector general looking over his department\nAnd he's worried that it could be a political weapon\nThe he vetoed the common council's resolution the common council overrode his veto so now you've got a ... inspector general\nWho will be located in the clerk's office reviewing the work of the mayor this is not going to end well All right it's two fifty four when

talking about all that in just sick if I have a broader question they asked for free you view it occasionally attend live sporting events or direct we're [noise]\nAs a general rule\nDo do you stay till the end of the game ever since I've become a father of young children almost never almost\nNever because you gotta you gotta get home you can usually we see the uh the sausage race and then I tried to convince the newly\nOkay if it were not though for childcare responsibilities oh you have to be able to write it mean nobody you know you now now All right I'm as you think back on games that you you went to maybe where it was a blowout whether it's football or baseball blowouts one way or the other sometimes you know you're leaving the six or seven pending\nSure yeah and football games you know if it's if it said blowouts\nHey you know your your team is ahead or losing by Seventeen or twenty four points\nYou decided to maybe I'll be traffic and get a head start on hackers fans did better in game one against the bears you may remember right and and if it came to regret that and they came to regret it but at least in that case it appeared to be a blowout and jam times you you make the wrong decision right now I Want you to consider another\nPossibility let's say you don't have childcare responsibilities and you've been sitting through the entire game and the game is tied with like four minutes left are are you going to leave for a minute or [laughter]\nNo I I I don't think I ever did\nI Know you wouldn't have right now nobody would leave it to for a minute we'll say nobody\nBecause we know somebody who has made that decision I I was All right my my producer my producer friend grew\nWho I asked him yesterday I said hey are you going to the the watch party we're having and stuff and he said no I'm I'm going to ... I got tickets to go see San Francisco play the Packers oh cool that that that's great and we were also talking about how he's going to be no long drive back in the early morning and all that type of stuff that you're going to the Packers game\nSo he goes to the Packers game and I said to him this morning boy\nWas really an exciting ending was of it and it kinda looks at me well um we uh we we kinda left a little early we left thoroughly now I I'm thinking okay well maybe maybe he got disheartened and left when they were behind by seven points or something no no no he says no we left with about four minutes left\nAnd the game was tied you need to tell me you went to that game you sat through the entire thing and then with four minutes remaining you you leave\nWhen the game is tied he said what we'd be traffic can be good at work rooted you're you're able to skip traffic but well yeah it was like if you beat traffic yeah well okay well why bother Gulf did I say I told them and that don't have to deal with traffic at all I mean how do you walk out in a tie I get I I understand\nIf their head by ten or they're behind by ten or whatever but\nThe Packers were on channel twelve and they were on ESPN so theoretically there's a larger number of people who watch the Packers but here are the preliminary numbers according to the journal sentinel the brewers for nothing victory over the Dodgers\nHad an average twenty five point three household rating is pretty big meaning two hundred and fourteen thousand plus households were tuned to the game on the other hand the Packers they had a I'm thirty three point seven\nCombined rating from a again channel twelve and ESPN so they deserve to platforms you could watch them on\nBut they uh they did it again the brewers numbers were twenty five point three Packers numbers were thirty three point seven that translates into about two hundred and eighty six thousand washers so the Packers drew\nI don't know somewhere around Seventy thousand more households in the Milwaukee area that we're watching 'em and candidly that surprises me that surprises me a lot\nBecause it is in fact playoff baseball and of course you also had the Packers um well I mean let's face it this year's pack routine is struggling even though yesterday's game was great\nI I went with the with the brewers as my primary but for those of us who did\nWe were apparently in the minority which again demonstrates that this is a great baseball area but football continues to be somewhat of a religion so more people watch the Packers be curious to see if there's other conflicts whether or not that continues to be the case is the brewers march\nThrough the playoff continues which is what we're going to discuss when we come back\nThe Milwaukee Brewers team they can't get any respect stick around twenty seven suggest quicker doubled U. T. M. J. then we're live streaming on Facebook dot com [noise]\nWill be basically wants to lead it looks like it'll bring another ... for the crew we know veal ... gets the sharpest who should be the first ... I think he's alive from Dodger Stadium built share his idea tonight at six or seven\nAll right [noise] I uh especially during the playoffs I I I take it a lot of the national media and not just talking about like the ESPN Fox Sports one stuff\nI read a lot of national commentary and I listen a lot on my free time to like the major league baseball thing on satellite radio and I will tell you one of the frustrating things for me and this is just this is adjust here knock the chip off my shoulder\nAt from Milwaukee ... listening to the ...\nThat goes on by these national analysts about Los Angeles Dodgers he's gag inducing it is gag inducing a here's the reality the brewers one Ninety six games playing in the toughest division in the national league\nThe Dodgers one Ninety two games playing in division where well there there's some cupcakes that that are there\nBrewers I think played a tougher scheduled they one form or games but if you listen to these national commentators like it's I don't care whether you're talking about satellite radio or Fox Sports one where you're reading the commentary in the u._s._a. today\nThe bias for Los Angeles is incredible are very on Jay Stewart she has a piece up on our website all the analysts on Fox Sports one last night all of them\nAll of them predicted the Dodgers were going to roll over the brewers last night and that has been the attitude since the start\nThis year the brewers team that get no respect at least in my opinion from the national media I don't think they'd been on the radar screen all year I listen to some of the national commentators I don't think they they don't know how to pronounce the names of some of the players and in general they are kind of clueless\nOur number for one for seven nine nine one six twenty fantasy accurate mortgage talk and tech slide right obviously locally we know how good does Tina's argue as frustrated as I Am with the ...\nSlide alright obviously locally we know how good does teenagers are you as frustrated as I Am with the national coverage of the brewers [noise]\nGo for the invaders young was rated the glory\nWill be given the holes are and saying here's one I posted on Facebook a week ago [noise] go brewers underestimate overlook the flying under the popular kids radars and when it all for the small market\nAnd again I [laughter] I ... that that there might be some exceptions\nBut if somebody who takes in a lot of of this meeting and talking about the print media the electronic medium eighty eighty five percent yesterday if you listen to it you didn't even have to play the game\nBecause the Dodgers had this ... fuel or kid pitching the brewers would be able to hit in ... she couldn't get people out no problem at all the Dodgers were going to roll and then they were going to go and maybe there'd be winning the whole thing\nAll of those people are eating crow today every analyst at the Fox sports one predicted the brewers would lose they were wrong this is the team that has gotten no respect it at all they're not on the radar screen because we're from flyover country and I guess getting a little bit frustrated to me Mary Hartman Mary you're on WGM Jay hello\nHi I ... I think they're higher rate it my husband and I buy and sang and frustrating part that I Am mhm how to speak for like ... right right right and then not even crowd aimed at\nThere are much chuckling after all right like I had a rough outing right there were how frightening to watch it quite yet again and again you can definitely address the way that they don't even know what a\nWait and see I I I bet you most of those people never watched the brewers game during the course of the year because you all you do what you watch the Yankees and the red Sox and and so you know the Los Angeles team I I was I was in Europe last week somebody was telling me you know Bob Costas apparently kept calling 'em Aggie are ... or something like that yeah\nThat's right exactly I I I I find out who you are on the air out like ... and yep yep and now he's not even out here and\nThere are a lot of other sports fan in general um I think that you can gravitate so tonight I'm first just things that aren't quite as part of life you might be you know ... ... at it that there's some small\nRape story you you were right here in the area and you know hundred million salary right it it's\nIt's a great story I mean it really is this kind of David and Goliath thing but again it is there's this huge larger market biased it's out there\nAnd I think a lot of these people don't follow the tea but never followed the team so what they do is they get their little like sheets of the producers right out for them and they read the faucet no it's essentially ... dress I mean I if if you were driving past me on the freeway will I'm going home or something\nAnd you find myself playing it looks like I'm yelling at the radio that's because I'm yelling at the radio because again I have some national commentator from serious or something it's just talking about oh I don't think the brewers are going to be able to hit this guy and\nYou know they they they don't like the way council plays the game they might respect great council but they don't like the idea that oh you you're bringing these pictures and they get a couple of hours of the time that's not how it's done the teams to win the world series are the teams that have the great starting pitching in and this this new revolution oh this is just this new trendy thing\nAnd you know Clinton crush all the great Dodger pitcher on his way to the whole thing he's going to dominate the brewers that's going to be a quick to wins where are they going to get the other ones and\nThey don't even acknowledge this clueless and is that there are just wrong they don't appreciate how good this team isn't yes if I sound a little frustrated and I sound like inventing that's exactly what I Am doing here's attacks thank you yes yes yes yes\nAbsolutely no reflections don't know how to pronounce pronounce names only reliever they can talk about his hater and then to question councils decisions on when to use the arms dealer must be the next Nolan Ryan to hear them talk unbelievable that's what I was hearing yesterday Mac downtown that you're on WGM Jay\n\nHi yeah I uh I totally agree with what you're saying that\nI was seeing that yesterday from a from ESPN bad out of the Dodgers winning or last night's game six to narrow and then even after you know what we can steal from the brewers are they have the Dodgers waiting to like a six to three so I mean\nYou know you're you're saying um you know a lot of the the narrative that are like you know can brewers how can they ride the street and be you know the ... um you know run spring Dodgers team right and and it's like you know we were very high I mean absolutely but\nThis is more than just the streak unless there's more than just you know October walk\nYeah I mean we may not look as though yeah I mean let's look at this okay the\nBrewers play in a tougher division and the Dodgers do up and down you know to play baseball you've got these unbalanced schedule so the brewers you know they're they're playing the cardinals and they're playing the pirates and they're playing the cubs all teams that are well over five hundred\nThat's the toughest schedule and the national league and the brewers won four more games than the than the vaunted Los Angeles Dodgers with their two hundred and twenty million dollar payroll dead\nBut of course they're they're they're not on anybody's radar screens because well you know TV the TV people live in Los Angeles where they live in New York so they're not paying attention to the brewers and\nYou know and again it's just I guess I I I I'm dating I admit it but and maybe I've got this chip on my shoulder but this is a great story and you know people should be talking about how exciting the scene is to come out of nowhere and be doing all this great stuff and set up a welder lucky you are writing the ... for whatever\nAbsolutely and um\nI didn't know what the one thing that I think it was interesting is uh you know you bring up a good point in the market various don't get as many nationally televised games so yeah we are writing a little bit on under the radar if you're not from around the area yeah but I mean you look at our our kitchen staff which has been given you know break her either you know actually been given respect\nWhen the wages of the um ... very glad to have you with us yeah I understand what I'm about to have to make some people's heads explode and I apologize for that in advance but [noise] I think the last couple of weeks [noise] I think President Trump has been doing\nA pretty darn good job of it and getting some attention obviously getting getting Brett Kavanaugh\nThrough the U.S Senate narrowly if it's still getting them through\nHuge huge accomplishment I think you know Trump is taken the right tone if you look at the\nAh his his approach to trade wars which you know and I'm I'm not a fan of getting into trade wars but his let's talk tough attitude has I think done well I think it brought Kennedy in and I think you've got a deal that's percolating was going to be a lot better\nFor the United states than the NAFTA was a Trump the the reports are he's raised over a hundred million dollars for his reelection campaign I think it it's been\nEven his staunchest opponents\nWould have to acknowledge that there's been a couple good weeks now even when you had the stock market just go into the dumpster for two days yesterday yeah last week you know you had your Trump was blaming the Federal Reserve for that and I think that might have gotten some traction by the way\nFor for everybody who who panics when there is a bad day in the market\nOne of the reasons why all the financial advisors tell you that you've got to be in it for the long haul and you can't panic\nIs because for every day like there were two days last week which admittedly were brutal there's days like today Dow Jones right now is up four hundred and Seventy seven points\nThe NASDAQ is up a hundred and Ninety two points percentage wise that's a to point six percent increase and here's the thing if you panic after a bad it's it's why financial analysts all say you have to be in this for the long run\nBecause if you react to a particular day in the market and you get up oh my God the stock market went down fourteen hundred points over a three day period and look and I understand\nBelieve me I understand how frustrating it is but if you panic and you say okay I'm I'm getting out of the stock market I'm going to I don't know take all my money in cash and put her under the bed or whatever\nYou you end up missing days like today where you know the ... four hundred and Seventy points who knows where it's going to finish in the NASDAQ up a hundred and eighty eight points if if you pull out your money you you missed those big dates that's why they say over time you you end up you know whether your bowl or a bear over time you you end up\nMaking money in the stock market but you you can't react to what happens on a given day and in today's again the the indicator of that\nYou know if people would have panicked and pulled a large chunk of their money out of the stock market based on what happened a couple of days last week you would miss market rallies like this and I'm just saying All right so any event I\nThink he'll President Trump has had a good couple weeks as a general rule at the same time he still has a tendency to I don't know pick fights that are\nBeyond me and I want to discuss something's going on now if you turn on\nTendency to I don't know pick fights that are absolutely beyond me and I want to discuss something's going on now and if you turn on the talking heads shows tonight you will see a lot of it\nAll right Stormy Daniels and her sleazy lawyer Michael lab and daddy Stormy Daniels is of course the pornographic film actress who says\nBack in two thousand seven I was reading some report describing her as as as President Trump's alleged mistress she wasn't his mistress her story as he is at a golf tournament she's at a golf tournament\nThey have sex one night that that's that that is not to me a mistress it would be a one night stand although if you believe her it does not sound like they were standing very much so that's the deal\nPresident Trump of course denies it happened if it did happen\nI don't know I I'm not sure President Trump has the ability to have a lot of self reflection but at some point in time in the middle of night if it did in fact happened he's\nGot to be regretting that it did because Stormy Daniels who is the greatest publicity hound since Barnum and Bailey and of course one of the most dangerous places to be in the United states nowadays is between Stormy Daniels are her real name is Stephanie Clifford ... and a camera and she travels across the country trying to\nAgain give her her career as a strip club entertainer or a boost and but she she shows up because she's a woman who says she slept with President Trump ... getting all these different stories and get the publicity well anyhow at one point in time Stephanie Clifford Case Stormy Daniels files a defamation lawsuit against President Trump\nRight now I I'm not exactly sure under the circumstances\nGiven the fact that she is a publicity hound to the extreme I'm not sure how you could exactly defame her but the bottom line was this defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge\nYesterday right ... throat so President Trump has one now I Would argue that if you are the leader of the free world\nThere's really nothing to gain\nFrom what I've been called punching down you know engaging with a pornographic film actress who says that the two of you had sex ten or eleven years ago and I guess I'm One of these people that argue the quicker than the Stormy Daniels becomes a a small footnote in history the better it will be but\nPresident Trump was not satisfied with simply winning the lawsuit\nSo today he sent out a tweet here's what the tweet from ... real Donald Trump says federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to fully legal fees hashtags box at Fox News great now I can go after horse face\nAnd for a third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total card\nSo he tweets about his take this case being dismissed and calls stormy Daniels' case Stephanie Clifford\nHorse face All right\nAt which point in time um this brings out a couple of responses Michael ... who is kind of the sleazy lawyer\nThat represents Stephanie Clifford he sends out a tweet saying\nYou are a disgusting massaging is and an embarrassment to the United states bring everything you have because we're going to demonstrate to the world with a complete Shakespeare and a liar you are how many other women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home each week All right and then\nThe former adult film star this would be Stormy Daniels herself she weighs in ladies and gentlemen may I present your president in addition to his ... shortcomings he has demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women and the lack of self control on Twitter again\nAnd perhaps a penchant for beef theology game on tiny okay so\n[noise] we now have the president of United States calling this pornographic film actress or space we have her lawyer hitting back and we now have her talking about the president once again and his ...\nAll right for one for seven nine nine was six when he does he acted mortgage talk and tech slide\nI don't know about you but I just wanted all to stop I I really I really do and like I say I think President Trump's had a good couple of weeks I I I Do I think he's gotten back on message she'd gotten stuck done to me engaging in engaging\nWith somebody on Twitter like the Michael ... of the world or the Stormy Daniels of the world lowers\nEven among fans of the president's\nMe do does he really gain something by again while looming in the mud he calls her horse face she then I mean she said all sorts of stuff about him and you you know that she's a publicity hound and she's not going to stop but then now it's the references to genitalia\nAnd all the while I'm thinking was that a country to run for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the academic mortgage talking tax life I guess here is my specific question do you think President Trump but again\nShe not this off is this the type of tweet that you think\nAdvances his claws helps him out your love to see it or is this the type of thing that maybe it just kind of take your victory in court\nFile for the you know the fees that you're entitled to\nDeclare victory and go on for one for seven nine nine one six twenty right was President Trump's tweet about Stormy Daniels that been invited the response was this a good idea for one for seven nine nine when six twenty but as he acted mortgage talking tech slide we discuss in a moment\nIf you're on the line please hold on it's one Eighteen to suggest that you're WGM Jay\n[noise] it was funny just ... it was a hunting for

yes so it it's again you've got to go back six to ten generations best case scenario she's one sixty four it's Native American\nWorst case scenario one one thousand and twenty four but\nBy any stretch of the imagination where there is there some tiny trace of again Native American DNA and her ancestry it's not like she has any sort of\nIn a common experience with the Native American experience you know in America in two thousand Eighteen but\nAny well since she came out with this she has been mocked\nBy both Republicans\nAnd Democrats um of course you know President Trump hasn't backed down on this\nNumber of the Republicans are pointing out that okay here she might be one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American and and she's saying okay this this shows that I have some degree of Native American ancestry a number of\nTrue Native Americans are saying some teeny tiny portion of DNA six to ten generations\nAgo doesn't mean that you're Native American and it doesn't mean that you can relate to the experience and the number of Democrats are saying oh my goodness why would you do something like this\nA few weeks before the midterms when you know now this all this has got to do for for example Jim Messina is the former president former campaign manager of President Obama in two thousand twelve he says argue the substance all you want\nBut why twenty two days before a crucial election where Democrats must win house and Senate to save America why did Senator Warren have to do or announcement today why can't Democrats ever stay focused\nRight for one for seven nine nine months ago and by the way a number of members of Native American tribes or denouncing this as well as like what\nWhat is what does this mean somewhere generations and generations and generations ago there there might be a tiny bit of in this case Native American blood in in your\nIn your background is what what if instead of again the Native American claim what if this was well we can find maybe some you know African blood you're ...\nIt is what what if instead of again the Native American claim what if this was well we can find maybe some you know African blood or your claim that does that mean that Elizabeth Warren has some sort of significant tied to people who were enslaved in the Seventeen hundreds\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the ac unit mortgage talk and ...\nI guess I I I looked at this I shook my head because\n[noise] going back six to ten generations in an effort to try to claim that you know you somehow can relate to the problems of a particular group and escaped Native Americans I think it's just absolutely ridiculous I think Elizabeth Warren\nOver her career has been an opportunist\nI'm On a level of some other prominent opportunists and this idea that he or she is going to try to put two questions put to rest questions or ethnicity by releasing something like this\nI just don't think people care and candidly I think it makes her look ridiculous for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the second mortgage talk and text line\nWas this a mistake by Elizabeth Warren are are people going to somehow say oh okay ten generations ago there might have been some\nNative American DNA well okay now we understand the claims that she can relate to the problems of the Native American community because she's got some Native American blood really for one for seven nine nine one six twenty we discuss in just a moment it's one forty to this is Jeff ... like I say I I think if you go back\nFar enough I my guess is you you can you can find almost anybody that has I don't know some sort of DNA that came from somewhere for one for seven and nine one sixth twenty it's\nOne forty three we're back to discuss in just a moment if you're on the line please hold on\nOne forty six whether it will be tempting to me with Elizabeth Warren did yesterday demonstrates that the sort of in title mentality mentality that you see\nShe puts out this this story saying All right I've had a DNA test and it shows that maybe maybe somewhere between six to ten generations ago I might have had some Native American\nNative American blood All right to which\nAnd how does that what is that gain and actually one of the tribal spokesman says this is all about Elizabeth Warren using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation\nOr any tribal nation even vaguely inappropriate in wrong Senator Warren undermines tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage I mean in what world\nDo we say hey I'm One sixty fourth this or I Am one one thousand and twenty four this so that means I somehow and part of that minority community and I understand it really for one for seven nine nine one six plenty of bill and Mount Pleasant billiard WGM Jay good afternoon or\nGood afternoon uh my wife we're just talking about this yesterday we are actually\nFunny my wife and I bought the ancestry dot com right and my wife is actually Canadian citizen yeah um but ah\nHer her burger generation that aren't great great great grandmother was actually a Native American so we know that\nYou know you're not right to\nKnow that three generations ago not six generations OK guys\nAnd they show that she was eight and nine\nAnd ... ... American or most people are saying that our Native American are cave it through oh I shouldn't be because the care very straight\nAnd they walk away from Asia all the way down or do you know but I really the whole point is that she's trying your something that a big ... and ... as a minority or\nYou know and ... which are showing how shallow you have to go\nTo ... yeah ... it's at all you are is that I mean is that your whole it primarily\nWhat we're right right and also is that does that tie you win All right are are you familiar with the ... how do you relate to the Native American experience by the fact of virtue that six to ten generations ago maybe you had a relative who\nYou know was was Native American and in some small part I mean it's just it's it's ridiculous I mean\nYour wife I assume would not claimed that she can relate to the Native American experience which she\nWell no but like shapes enough [laughter] yeah I got the ... that\nThey say well listen as Warren I mean and look and this is from the perspective of a really white guy I mean all of Elizabeth Warren ... [noise]\nI don't think anybody would mistake Elizabeth Warren for somebody who grew up on on an American Indian reservation I just that's just not the case for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nLet's talk to Russell in Brookfield roughly or WTO O. J. hello\nUh Hi I'm ... years or do you should go to your tremendous amount of name recognition all across the country it's like going warrior\nDoes he ... things I can get all those free ... personally I'm being talked about it just every time shift to do it just stays there so it was like you get free advertising it just ...\nWell I mean I think they should call right but here's what I Would say for for anybody who said that there is no such thing as bad publicity they've never had bad publicity me 'cause the the reality is in this case I mean clearly Elizabeth Warren did this because she wants to run for president\nPresident Trump has been calling her Pocahontas and she wants to demonstrate that no this is true that I really do you know when when I made these claims in my past about you know having this Native American you know blood and my blood line that I really\nDo have it well it turns out it's absolutely ridiculous that and if I again it it's not like saying hey you know my great great grandparents were slaves or something like that I got and so\nI I've I've grown up with this bias and prejudice and I can relate to all the different struggles that people are having that that's not to this is six to ten generations ago most people are looking at this I think in rolling their eyes and candidly I think she played and I I have\nI think she played right to President Trump's hands because by by putting this out she's made herself look ridiculous and if you're planning to run\nFor the president of the United states for the presidency I think in many cases looking ridiculous is the last thing that you ended up wanting to do in in any event I guess\nIt's up to the voters but I Will tell you this this has gone over like a lead balloon\nAnd I'm even a number of Democrats are saying oh my gosh you know we're trying to focus on this or that or the other thing and now the story for today is how one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for president in two thousand twenty\nShe's out with some DNA kit complaining and saying that I might be one one thousand twenty fours Native Americans so that that means I can somehow relates to the problems of people who are in fact Native American big big big mistake by Elizabeth Warren and I think she has made herself look ridiculous and I'll go one step further\nFiguring alternative route\nEm thanks for the call let's see because it takes that came from seven mile road heading north on Ninety four there was a tomato and a small issue the upper middle wall\nHave happened on the south side but they're on the middle wall huh I'm just got to the north bound lanes vehicle on top of the median concrete\nI'm absolutely alright then a number of squad cars as well I think there's another backup southbound on forty five is well we'll bring you continue updates on the traffic but there are some messages on the roadway so my advice is a kind of think about alternative routes if you have to be out about All right when we come back\nIf you are older and you're looking for a job\nAre you being discriminated against and when I tell you about a story and then we're gonna discuss stick around to fourteen Geoff whether it will be ... alright here here's the reality need the recession of a number of years ago ...\nImpact that a lot of people it costs a lot of people to delayed their retirement plans because a lot of people to get down to money to save for retirement they ended up spending it to kind of live and so a lot of people now maybe they're\nWorking longer than they hit originally tempted to work\nIn addition what happened is during the recession a lot of people who were perhaps old her ended up losing their jobs and I think as much as is anybody it's the people who are in maybe their fifties and sixties who had the most difficult time trying to get comparable type jobs\nThere are law says it's simply lawyers cannot discriminate against people based on on their age and yet I think a lot of us believe that those laws are very very difficult to enforce and the ...\nAnd yet I think a lot of us believe that those laws are very very difficult to enforce and that a lot of people are in fact discriminated based on their age let me give you a story this is the Chicago Tribune the other day dice fifty eight years old he he's a lawyer\nWith a link the record of success you've had decades of experience he was a general counsel at deans foods\nHe was the c._e._o. of a dairy products trade group\nAnd and he was trying to look at those jobs for whatever reason and he was trying to get something comparable way couldn't get anything comparable so he decided well All right I'm I'm not going to be\nIn a position where general counsel for some large company but you know what\nI I still know my stuff and I I'm not at the age of fifty eight I'm not ready to retire at this point in time\nI don't want to start drawing down my retirement money so what I'm going to do is I'm going to lower my expectations I Am going to work at a job that no one said beneath them that's not what I mean but he may be he's he's arguably arguably overqualified for the job but you know what the heck yeah job is a job\nSo he starts looking for\nCorporate counsel types of jobs and he finds his job to advertise it it's they're looking for a senior counsel position\nAt um medical technology company\nUm and it's OK well it just looks like something that I I could perhaps do and then he comes across the at\nThe ad says looking for senior counsel\nThree to seven years experience but no more than seven years of relatively relevant legal experience so three to seven years no more than seven of relevant legal experience and the guy says wait a minute\nYou know what what do you mean I understand minimum that you want okay somebody that's worked in the field three years of relevant legal experience that that's fine but what do you mean no more than seven\nWhat should you care and what if I've got twenty five years of experience you know it it doesn't that make me arguably perhaps more qualified\nThan never got an interview because he has more than seven years of relevant legal experience and now he's turned around and and he he's filed a lawsuit saying this is blatantly this late age discrimination you know they're\nThey are saying that you know they they don't want somebody because by limited ... somebody at the top and do a seven years of experience what they're saying is we don't want anybody who is older we don't want anybody who has more experience\nAnd this is I think this is bringing up this whole issue did a lot of older Americans are finding\nThat you go in for the these jobs and you know you're just not getting in the door because despite the fact that the law says he can't discriminate against people based on age that is precisely what is happening and maybe it's because the employers\nWho offer health benefits recognize that somebody who is sixty maybe and I say maybe maybe statistically more likely to I don't know draw down on the health benefits than somebody who's Thirty years old\nMaybe it's because they figured that okay if you get the job at fifty five\nMaybe you're going to only stay eight to ten years whereas if we're looking for somebody who's going to be a part of the company for decades you know we're we're better off going with somebody who's thirty five\nBut this is I think in many respects a real problem that older Americans are having as they jump into the job market now it's very very tough I guess to prove it but in this particular case the guy saying hey I I've got I've got objective evidence of this\nThey're telling me that I Am essentially overqualified for this job well who are they told me that\nI if I'm willing to do it what should it matter but they're really saying by putting a limit on the amount of experience is they don't want older more seasoned people that want to open up the phone with our numbers for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that if he acted mortgage talking text why\nI Will tell you this anecdotal\nMy sent and this is just from some conversations that I've had with people over the last several years that even in a job market\nWhere you know we're nearing full employment but from the perspective of people who are older and again I'm Talking about in the fifties and sixties but not ready to retire and again willing and able to contribute\nThere there is an incredible anti slash old bias that is there\nAnd that you have employers maybe suddenly maybe not so suddenly who are essentially saying we're not interested in older workers\nHave you found it back to be the case for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the acting it mortgage hockey and tech slide and again I mean I understand that\nThere were a lot of jobs for example that have just disappeared that were occupied by people who might have been in their forties and fifties and and those jobs are gone and those jobs aren't coming back\nBut have you noticed a reluctance or do you believe there is a reluctance on the part of employers to hire people again who are in their fifties and sixties because despite what they might be willing to say he truthfully just don't want to deal with\nOlder but you know not retiring Americans let's start with Diane entails corner WTO O. J. good afternoon\nHello yeah Hi Diana you're talking about my life story right now no really [laughter]\nOr not or the nightmare a\nNightmare that's holding an eye on my job and October I still don't have a job I have applied to many many many times in between\nI had a number of interviews [laughter] someone someone I got there I realized that wasn't what I wanted others I Would have liked the job and didn't get the offer\nBut there were many jobs that I Would have been perfect or it was like they were writing my description I never heard the word I turned I Would say when I Want to turn into\nI I Know I'm sure that I'm tired of it I met a few weeks ago and it was it was about to tell people\nFeedback they really liked me but then I gave it\nTo his presumably younger than you\nKnow one of them I don't know what's coming at first or second interview and I walked out the door and she was quite a bit younger than me and I thought okay there you know I don't know that can be a fact I think it is certainly a component\nBut but I think it's really hard worker and very dedicated Coronado myself are they telling you what's known right [laughter] right [laughter] you know I I Am I really don't get me to\nRead and I I think she and I think there is that frustration I mean I understand\nYou know it it sounds like what's going on is ... ... ... you can't discriminate against people based on age but the problem is how do you prove this to mean that right and and how do you ... if if you were to first of all how do you prove it secondly\nI'm you know ... you you presumably to try to work you don't have the wherewithal to go hire a lawyer that's going to you than filed the lawsuit and things like that I think this is going on a lot I think there is blatant age discrimination when it comes to people trying to get jobs in\nThis argument that well maybe you're overqualified for a particular job of nuts to there I mean if if you're willing to work at the job\nYou would think that somebody would love to have somebody who's overqualified\n[laughter] sorry that you know what were they didn't want anybody with more than seven years of experience that kind of funny because I never thought about that but my own mother my mother pointed out to me when I was reading\nIt was like two to five years of experience and she said well you've got way more than five years won't even look at you yeah I thought oh I think they're just they only want it that much but you know thinking that if they're looking for and they don't want my own and they don't want a more\nWell yeah I mean I mean I I mean that I got to tell you again and this is this is just you know take it for what it's worth but when it when I saw that what do you think it through if you say you know I mean I I understand a minimum you you know you we want three years because okay so you know which like in the field\nIs I think sometimes subtle sometimes less subtle discrimination against people as they get older and it's one of the huge undercover stories about the ... out there\n[noise]\nThere is an extreme [noise] interesting in my opinion very under ... going\nOn in Milwaukee city hall you have Tom Barrett who was of course the the mayor and Tom Barrett\nHas various department heads\nWho he has nominated the common council approved some but the date at it in essence report to the mayor right he the mayor is is the boss\nAnd we've seen some of these department heads have done a crummy dropped the health department has been an absolute mess for the last several years you've got the whole problem you know with lead in the water and all that type of stuff\nIt's it's been a problem but the mayor is ultimately because the mayor is the elected official\nThe mayor is responsible and and he says possible to the voters voters get upset about the way you know a particular that the city is being run they take it out on on the mayor and the department heads have reported to him\nThe common council which has the ability to approve you know say yes or no department heads the common council in Milwaukee is now sort of flexing its muscles and what they wanted to do is they wanted to create a position of an inspector general\nAnd the inspector general would be located in the clerk's office and the inspector general would essentially\nSoup last supervise but would have the ability to oversee and monitor the various departments that are under the control of Tom Barrett okay Eric do set breaking news\nWe have a large fire near chasing Oklahoma I visited there recycling center according to Milwaukee fire and this is a big one there is black smoke that can be seen for miles and want to bring you a little bit of sound I got from I just spoke with the settlement on the phone and he is describing what he is seeing right now in the south side of Milwaukee\nOut on the highway and walks John I Ninety or editing or a downtown Milwaukee and from the highway rising up on the tree is just a giant or a black smoke eating into the air and it looks like it's somewhere\nMaybe towards the south side of Milwaukee maybe by the lake but it is so huge ... show\nMe a little bit of a low cater again I Know you have if you asking you to repeat high so to me talking to him is they're chasing Oklahoma again on the south side near the airport\nAnd recycling fire according to Milwaukee fire when we spoke with the fire chief deputy fire chief Melissa we're speaking with him while they were still responding so we don't know yet the significance of this fire but again any large fires near and recycling center chasing Oklahoma right now in the south\nAnd you couple that with all the other traffic mess that's going on and it is an absolute nightmare All right we'll have an update in just a couple of minutes of that but if you're wondering what the black ... is well I saw some pictures of it is it looks like\nIt's a recycling fire is what it is but if there's black smoke miserable from all over we'll give you an update about what's going on there and just one finished my thought about this inspector general comment council wants inspector general to be located in the clerk's office to essentially\nWell they would have the power to investigate the various departments that are out there well that's the last thing Tom Barrett wants inspector general looking over his department and he's worried that it could be a political weapon\nHe vetoed the common council's resolution the common council overrode his veto so now you've got a ... inspector general\nWho will be located in the clerk's office reviewing the work of the mayor this is not going to end well All right it's two fifty four when we come back we'll find out what's on the agenda for Wisconsin's afternoon news please stick around\nWelcome to the W.

I got tickets to go see San Francisco play the Packers oh cool that that that's great and we were also talking about how he's going to be no long drive back in the early morning and all that type of stuff that you're going to the Packers game\nSo he goes to the Packers game and I said to him this morning boy that was really an exciting ending was of it\nAnd it kinda looks at me well um we uh we we kinda left a little early we left thoroughly now I I'm thinking okay well maybe maybe he got disheartened and left when they were behind by seven points or something no no no he said no we left with about four minutes left and the game was tied\nYou need to tell me you went to that game you sat through the entire thing and then with four minutes remaining you you leave when the game\nIs tied he said what we'd be traffic did it work rooted here you're able to skip traffic what you like it yeah it would be like if you beat traffic yeah well okay well why bother going home and that don't have to deal with traffic at all I mean how do you walk out in a tie get I\nI understand if they're ahead by Tatar there'd be hired by ten or whatever\nBut you sit through the whole thing is tied and you walk out with four minutes left [noise] wow maybe some people may maybe ... in ... he he's defending itself I think they're free\nTickets I didn't matter\nTo me it it's it's that's not the point that it's not\nThat is what we call a fixed cost one way or the other you know that that money is spent or not sped who walks out with four minutes of well we know my producer of the four minute man walks\n[noise] in any events\nIn any event big night for Wisconsin's sports fans\nThe brewers big win for nothing the Packers mounted come back and win with a field goal in the last few seconds where you even in the car did you did you hear it at least did you hear that in the car oh you okay so you're ... you had enough time to at least get to the car in the parking lot before you're the guard All right\nOkay so he got at least the chance to to hear it although he missed it in person\nBut this was a huge night for Wisconsin's sports fans and there were you know choices to be made now I understand that you know for some people you may be due the picture and picture thing the TV but for most of us we had to make a decision\nAs to who which team\nWe were going to watch primarily now obviously I mean what what I did last night is I I chose one of the games to watch and then you know during you know breakthrough commercials or whatever I Would flip over and see how you know the other team was was doing\nBut you you had to make I think for many people the decision as to you know which you were going to watch or try to make arrangements\nDoing but you you had to make I think for many people the decision\nAs to you know which we're going to watch or try to make arrangements as to um if if you were going to try to watch the boats I Know some people have had ... were telling me they headed up on one game up on the computer and the other up on the TV where they had one on the radio and they were watching the other on TV\nDot com bubble\nWill be the ... one series leader gave for it looks like it'll bring another bullpen game for the crew we know\n... to start with who should be the first ... live from Dodger Stadium built share his idea tonight at six or\nSeven or if I eat a especially during the playoffs I I I take in a lot of the national media and not just talking about what the ESPN Fox Sports when stuff\nI read a lot of national commentary and I I I listen a lot on my free time to like the major league baseball thing on satellite radio and I will tell you one of the frustrating things for me and this is just this is adjust here knock the chip off my shoulder up from Milwaukee ... listening to the ...\nThat goes on by these national analysts about Los Angeles Dodgers ease gag inducing ... is gag inducing now here's the reality the brewers one Ninety six games playing in the toughest division or National League\nThe Dodgers one Ninety two games playing in a division where\nWell there there's some cupcakes that that are there\nBrewers I think play a tougher scheduled they won four more games but if you listen to these national commentators like it's I don't care whether you're talking about satellite radio or Fox Sports one where you're reading the commentary in the u._s._a. today\nThe bias for Los Angeles is incredible are very ... has a piece up on our website all the analysts on Fox Sports one last night all of them\nAll of them predicted the Dodgers were\nGoing to roll over the brewers last night and that has been the attitude since the start\nThis is a brewers team that gets no respect at least in my opinion from the national media I don't think they've been on the radar screen all year I listen to some of the national commentators I don't think they they don't know how to pronounce the names of some of the players and in general they are kind of clueless\nOur number for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the academic mortgage talk and tech slide right\nObviously locally we know how good does teenagers are you as frustrated as I Am with the national coverage of the brewers [noise]\nPretty good record UPN vigorous young frustrated glory will be given the holes aren't saying here's what I posted on Facebook a week ago [noise] go brewers underestimated overlook keep flying under the popular kids radars and made it all for the small market this and again I [noise] I create\nThat there there might be some exceptions\nBut as somebody who takes him a lot of of this meeting and talking about the print media electronic media eighty to eighty five percent yesterday if you listen to it you didn't even have to play the game\nBecause the Dodgers had the ... fuel or kid pitching the brewers would be able to hit him trashing touching couldn't get people out no problem at all the Dodgers were going to roll and then they were going to go on maybe there'd be winning the whole thing\nAll of those people are eating crow today every analyst at the Fox sports one predicted the brewers would lose they were wrong this is a team that has gotten no respect at all they're not on the radar screen because we're from flyover country and I guess getting a little bit frustrated to me\nMary and heartland Mary rent there'll be T. M. J. hello\nHi I I think they're under age ... my husband and I find fascinating press writing a\nBook that can remain mhm it for like ... right right right and that will not even pronounce same grain and they were all much shortly after the game I said\nLike I had about falling right and it was how frightening to watch like just like hey you really want to get it\nRight and and I see I I I bet you most of those people never watch the brewers game during the course of the year because you all you do what you watch the Yankees and the red Sox and and you know the Los Angeles team I I was I was in Europe last week with somebody was telling me you know Bob Costas apparently kept calling um\n... you are ... or something like that yeah\nThat's right exactly I I I I I look around me out right Brian interesting yep yep and it might even over here and there are a lot and the courts or general\nUm I think and you grab it so I came back um first it was for the light you might be out there that there's something to all\nThe rate dory you're right we're right in the area and they're no longer elementary right it\nIt it's a great story I mean it really is this kind of David and Goliath thing but again there's this huge larger market biased it's out there\nAnd I think a lot of these people don't follow the team but never followed the team so what they do is they get their little like sheets that the producers right out for them and they read this stuff off at knowing thanks ... dress I mean I\nIf if you were driving past me on the freeway was I'm going home or something\nAnd you find myself like ... it looks like I'm yelling at the radio that's because I'm yelling at the radio because again I have some national commentator from serious or something but just talking about oh I don't think the brewers are going to be able to hit this guy and\nYou know they and they they don't like the way council plays the game they might respect great council but they don't like the idea that oh you you're bringing these pictures and they get a couple of laps in the time that's not how it's done the teams to win the world series or the teams that have the great starting pitching him and this this new revolution oh this is just this new trendy thing\nAnd you'll Clinton crush all the great Dodger pitcher on his way to the whole thing he's going to dominate the brewers that's going to be a quick to wins where are they going to get the other ones and\nThey don't even acknowledge this clueless and is that there are just wrong they don't appreciate\nHow good this team isn't yes if I sound a little frustrated and I sound like I'm done thing that's exactly what I Am doing here's attacks thank you yes yes yes yes absolutely no reflection I don't know how to pronounce pronounce names only reliever they can talk about his hater and then to question councils decisions on when to use the arms dealer must be the next Nolan\nRyan to hear them talk unbelievable that's what I was hearing yesterday Mac downtown that you're a WTO O. J.\nOh yeah I I totally agree with what you're saying I ... I was the late yesterday from a from ESPN they had a the Dodgers winning or last night's game a fixture there oh and then even after you know what we do stay away from the brewers are they have the Dodgers waiting to light a six to three so I mean\nOh you know your ears um you know a lot of the the narrative that only you know can the brewers how can they ride the street and you know the ... um you know run scoring Dodgers team right and and it's like you know we were very hot I mean absolutely but\nThis is more than just the streak unless there's more than just you know October ...\nYeah I mean we might not look at all either yeah I mean let's look at this okay the brewers\nPlay in a tougher division and the Dodgers do up and down you know to play baseball you've got these unbalanced schedule so the brewers you know they're they're playing the cardinals and they're playing the pirates and they're playing the cubs all teams that are well over five hundred\nThat's the toughest schedule and the national league and the brewers won four more games than the than the vaunted Los Angeles Dodgers with their two hundred twenty million dollar payroll dead\nBut of course they're they're they're not on anybody's radar screens because well you know TV the TV people live in Los Angeles where they live in New York so they're not paying attention to the brewers and\nYou know and it can it's just I guess I I I'm venting I admit it but and maybe I've got this chip on my shoulder but this is a great story and you know people should be talking about how exciting the team has to come out of nowhere and be doing all this great stuff instead of well if they're lucky you are writing what for whatever\nAbsolutely and um and you know what I think it was interesting is\nUh you know you bring up a good point the market varies don't get as many nationally televised games do you are writing a little bit on a under the radar if you're not from around the area yeah but I mean you look at our our kitchen staff which has been given no break her either you know actually been given the respect but even with our pitching staff\nYou had a British show that you know the Dodgers bats are just too hot and it'd be storm QA runs but then you look at it after games and it is just not not you\nKnow ... ... exactly I mean look and look it is it possible that LA is going to come back and and and when the series yes I I guess it's possible I I respect them they are a good team what I Am frustrated with is the lack of respect that our team is getting\nA team that had a better regular season record than the vaunted Dodgers and at least as of right now is leading in the series guaranteeing that you know worst case scenario there's going to be a game six in Milwaukee and candid\nUh right now is leading in the series guaranteeing that you know worst case scenario there's going to be a game six in Milwaukee and candidly\nCandidly were it not for you know one bad pitch in one bad ending the Dodgers would be trying to win tonight to avert a sweep this has been the Dodgers have been at least in my opinion completely and totally out played by the Milwaukee Brewers but don't expect to hear that\nIf you tune into the national coverage um there's a tech I'm sick of hearing the national media keep on insinuating that the brewers are over achieving lucky and the NFL likely manager of the year ... council supposedly doesn't know what he's doing\nAbsolutely ... absolutely and I mean this I guess this is what you come to expect when you have this great local team is on the national stage but I'm frustrated with it for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to ah let's see let's talk to Dan in greenvale Daniel WTO O. J. good afternoon\nI have to do and what a biased media mhm hey with the market out there you know I don't I don't necessarily think their\nYou have to be in this for the long run because if you react to a particular day in the market and you get out oh my God the stock market went down fourteen hundred points over a three day period they look and I understand\nBelieve me I understand how frustrating that it has but if you panic and you say okay I I'm getting out of the stock market I'm going to I don't know take all my money in cash and put her under the bed or whatever\nYou end up missing days like today where you know the ... up four hundred and Seventy points who knows where it's going to finish in the NASDAQ up a hundred and eighty eight points if if you pull out your money you you miss those big days that's why they say over time you you end up you know whether your bowl or a bear over time you you end up\nMaking money in the stock market but you you can't react to what happens on a given day and in today's again the the indicator of that you know if people would have panicked and pulled a large chunk of their money out of the stock market based on what happened a couple of days last week you would miss market rallies like this and just say All right so\nAny event I think you know President Trump has had a good couple weeks as a general rule\nAt the same time he still has a tendency to I don't know hit fights that are absolutely beyond me and I want to discuss something's going on now and if you turn on the talking heads shows tonight you will see a lot of it\nAll right Stormy Daniels and her sleazy lawyer Michael ever that Stormy Daniels is of course the pornographic film actress who says back in two thousand seven I was reading some report is describing her as as as President Trump's alleged mistress she wasn't his mistress\nHer story as he is at a golf tournament she's at a golf tournament\nThey have sex one night that that's that that is not\nTo me a mistress it would be\nA one night stand although if you believe her it does not sound like they were standing very much so that's the deal\nPresident Trump of course denies it happened if it did happen\nI don't know I I'm not sure President Trump has the ability to have a lot of self reflection but at some point in time in the middle of night if it did in fact happened he's got to be regretting that it did because Stormy Daniels who is the greatest publicity hound since Barnum and Bailey\nAnd of course one of the most dangerous places to be in the United states nowadays is between Stormy Daniels are her real name is Stephanie Clifford ... and the camera and she travels across the country trying to again give for her career as a strip club entertainer or a boost\nAnd but she she shows up because she's the woman who says she slept with President Trump Bob off get early different stories and get the publicity\nWell anyhow at one point in time Stephanie Clifford Case Stormy Daniels\nFiles a defamation lawsuit against President Trump right now\nI I'm not exactly sure under the circumstances given the fact that she is a publicity hound to the extreme I'm not sure how you could exactly defame hurt but the bottom line was this defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge\nYesterday and I flip throat so President Trump has one now I Would argue that if you are the leader of the free world\nThere's really nothing to gain\nFrom what I'm going to call punching down you know engaging with a pornographic film actress who says that the two of you had sex ten or eleven years ago and and I guess I'm One of these people that argue the quicker that's the Stormy Daniels becomes a a small footnote in history the better it will be but\nPresident Trump was not satisfied with simply winning the lawsuit\nSo today he sent out a tweet here's what the tweet from ... real Donald Trump says federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump\nIs entitled to full legal fees hashtags Fox at Fox News great now I can go after horse face\nAnd her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total card\nSo he tweets about is this case being dismissed and calls Stormy Daniels AK Stephanie Clifford\nHorse face All right at which point in time um this brings out a couple

legalization of marijuana we have a great test case happening\nAs we speak in the country of Canada now United states has what three hundred fifty million people Canada has thirty seven million people so you know there's a little bit of imbalance their population\nBut as of midnight last night or twelve o one\nOne hundred and eleven illegal pot shops open across the nation of Canada no stores and Ontario they're still trying to figure out the the rules and regulations will have some open in spring and are just so everybody knows that we're talking about medical marijuana has been legal since two thousand one again so this is a recreational marijuana\nWe've seen the United states states have gone to this recreational marijuana lots of states have medicinal marijuana I'm a big fan of that I think it's important that we do that but a recreational marijuana's a completely different thing\nYou can even order it never sent right to your door\nYeah they also um anybody that was in in a custody that had a what was it thirty grams there are now being released for possession\nOf a great story from Vicki Barker this is thirty second said you will not forget check\nThis out as the clock

two years there\nAre led by prime minister Justin Trudeau plan for legalization or they want us to get out of the black market into more regulated system what's the big reason money dollars taxes um billions of dollars in investments\nAnd it comes back with a chance for a country of Canada to make money as I said before nine us states have\nLegal recreational marijuana thirty\nHave medicinal marijuana so that that Titus has been turning in this country a towards legalization of marijuana but we're going to find out again smaller sample size but still thirty seven million people in Canada most who live with him I think Ninety percent rather than a hundred miles of the border\nSo there is some similarities in the conduct in the culture there\nHow that works for them and that could\nHave studied correctly improperly with ... with good research good numbers tell us how these\nUh legalization of France the United states could or could play out what they might mean for the rest of us as

much money and to call on my Republican conservative friends you're contributing to this problem\nAnd all the ways that you should frankly be smarter about well it's easy to put money into programs like the defense budgets because we can always be a less safe by not doing that\nExamine what you spend think about the dollars you spent for all the uh the laziness as happened on on reform of

Fifteen miles from the village but um they weren't trying to pass a number of referendum as\nA referendum with a number of different questions I guess it would be one of them was to build a new football stadium and uh there were a number of things or some other things that should have probably been under\nNormal maintenance but that they put in there and we've got a group of about twenty five people together and we put together campaigning and pay for it and instead it's okay to say no and we got everything voted down\nI took a lot of effort but you know if if people are listening to this a subject that are are not happy with what's going on they have to get out and it was something about it\nWell that's a great point thanks for the call Jerry thanks for listening from Green Bay as well I think you have a choice here voters have a say\nIn while you tend to see a lot of enthusiasm from younger voters those with with kids in the system they don't vote as often as elderly

school districts in the state of Wisconsin\nThat's a big number with some really big price tags for the folks in Middleton while uh Tulsa and a few other communities that I mentioned is that the new normal I think so\nEverybody wants to shiny stuff everybody\nWants to new stadiums everybody wants the ah the performing arts centers south Milwaukee beautiful performing arts center that cost them in excess of fifty million dollars they would argue with those folks in that community it's it was a great investment\nI'm not saying it's nuts but when you think about taxes and how\nThe various

career for the Baltimore Orioles he's due to be a free agent Baltimore was not playing well this year and so what they did is right before the trade deadline they shipped him to Los Angeles the brewers apparently made a run at trying to get him as well\nI think is things have turned out everybody's pretty glad this guy didn't pull can come to Milwaukee\nBut manning Machado now play shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers and he's due to you know go into free agency at the end of the year and one ... signed a huge contract he also in addition to be a very big in very talented player\nHas a reputation as a dirty player ... head case um he's got a a checkered history including throwing a bat at a pitcher\nIn twenty fourteen um after he swung and missed and he threw a bad try and hit the pitcher he's got a series of\nA very very hard slides and in general illegal type of slides where he's going in particularly the second base with the idea that he's going to try to you know not just disrupted double play but hurt the opposing players\nNow you might remember two nights ago he did this to the marquee shortstop Orlando Garcia whites\nWhere he slid pass the bag and he went after our see the second time he reached out and he grabbed Garcia by the lake he grabbed him by the lake which is against the rules and this isn't a new rule you've never been able to to do that\nAnd you know our sea is lucky that he didn't get hurt but that's the background and that's the type of player Machado is so last night in the tenth inning he grounds out to shortstop it is a routine and by the way he's been called out by a number of his own players from\nTime to time including in this series for not running hard\nAnd he said well I I just I don't want hard all the time you know it's just the way I play the game but any event here's a routine ground ball to shortstop he throw it out it's not a close play he's out by a couple of feet um pages FDR brewers first baseman got his foot on the base and what happens is\nAs Machado runs past and you've undoubtedly perhaps seen this replay he drags his left foot slash ankle and hits the back of our CEOs leg it is that type of play\nWhich can seriously injure a player there there there's no question about it because you're you're not expecting it\n... is lucky that he was not seriously hurt and if you look at the replays almost everybody Joe Buck not withstanding almost everybody says this this was intentional you can just tell he stuck out his leg with the idea that he was going to hit ask you are on this\nAnd this is again like I say it's not the first time that this has happened\nAfterwards the brewers were extremely unhappy with this because they saw it as a\nNot a dirty play a dangerous play and one that was done in intentionally\nUm Christian yellowish who is really a pretty calm guy he's going to be the MVP of the league this year\nYou know he he goes I mean he just goes on a tirade last night talking about how this particular play has no no no business in baseball of he does this over and over again he's just a dirty player\nA dirty play by a dirty player it absolutely is I have a lot of respect for him as a player but you can't respect somebody who plays the game like that\nAnd then it goes on and on and on now I was listening this morning to get some of the satellite sports radio things and I will tell you in this case almost everybody agreed that this was a dirty play by a punk\nWho had the potential to seriously injure another player\nAnd had no business and baseball some of the commentators were saying well this might cost him a little bit of money in free agency because some owners might just not want to be associated with a guy who does things like this because he's got the impulse control the fruit fly and will in all likelihood do stuff like this again\nI Want to open up the phone like our number for one for seven nine nine one six twenty as the accident mortgage talk ... I understand you're probably not going to see something like this in the playoffs\nBut I I think if major league baseball\nCares about integrity cares about protecting players I think Machado should be suspended now again maybe not for the play offs but certainly for some games next year I think this was a dirty play I think it was a dangerous play\nI think it has no part in baseball for one for seven nine nine when six twenty\nLike I say I think ... ...

J. radio show\nMan what radio show just how it is well there\nThere have been snow flurries and I actually some accumulated snow in the state already surround her way I was talking before the break I read a little bit of a John Case a piece in USA Today about this winner take all style of politics got a couple of callers I don't let's go to let's see let's go to Shirley in a corner on WGM chicken morning surely\nLearning what do you think I agree one hundred percent of our former governor gang ... Khan there mhm oh dog for where they don't work my way or the highway not work\nThe big question is what should we do will will it change what can we do about it\nWell we need to\nCome and get louder neighbors and our fellow man we may get down to my phone if and can have a look and ... you know\nI'm a big fan of that idea of the art of conversation there thanks for the call Shirley is is one that we need to get back to uh too much shouting at each other that doesn't really lead to um problem solving are solutions let's go to John in Milwaukee years every team Jake morning John\nHere morning what do you think\nI'm thinking Tom case is absolutely right and we kept on politicians that goal so\nYou know democracy and Brooklyn or they often and a\nWhole it according to a popular oh and I and my aunt and should the environment in one on when\nI'm home hearts that forty five percent on on on uh that we love it I mean grave environmental concern in twenty million people dress the damage that we get 'em on that list them through the majority of people or for\nOur environment like never served\nOn the phone allow us to a continuous station so I Can't speak is right you get to be on that there was some two dozen large body of people\nDo you think the current crop of a elected officials in Washington DC and I and I highly Washington DC because it is different on the national level and I think that it is at the state and local level local level\nI went there for I Would disagree you okay tell me why they\nHate and I'm like oh we have at a level are are not environmental conscience at\nHow much how much they put in the fact that there are different opinions on some of his stuff\nI I put I put my stake in the Ninety eight percent of the scientists that study to empower or what made him there\nThanks for the call John I got a lot of Texas as well so and I read a couple of them a mix from sturgeon bay just where with Governor cases like us to compromise with democratic legislators tax increases open borders socialize healthcare abolishing ice weakening the military national security justice is that legislate from the bench just where they are great ideas\nThis is this was kind of what I'm Talking about now I I'm On the points that Mrs making abolishing ice crazy open borders crazy\nHealth care for all seems like a great thing as you can ever figure out how to pay for it and and I think most reasonable rational fully understand is probably the most expensive ventures this country would ever go down to do that\nBut there are incremental improvements in solutions to some of these problems that you could make for example immigration DACA\nSecuring the border take the illegal immigrants out of the drug trafficking human trafficking when I had attorney general brush him on the show he told me Ninety percent of the drugs that come in to Wisconsin cross that border that shouldn't be a\nRepublican or democratic issue it should be both there's smart solutions we can find\nThat does involve listening to each other and and I would I Would put it this way we've gotten to this point because we don't listen to each other none of this is easy very complex problems that exist in for decades elected officials of kick the can down the road for far too long at some points\nProgress can be made but I think as as a governor case it said it's going to involve actually listening to what people say and then working I'm On solutions based on that important and I think that's the the the the power of his words somebody who\nWe need to reiterate the project is more than just honoring the victims it's also honoring the first responders those who survived and those who did and it's on during the U.S military those from\nWisconsin who enlisted after nine eleven and are no longer with us they were impacted by nine eleven they went overseas to fight for their country and now they they gave the ultimate sacrifice and then the the educational aspect of it and I can't stress that enough I mean we talked about it earlier Mike about how\nThese feelings come back to you will some folks never realize what those feelings where we have young Americans\nWho don't understand don't comprehend and they need to learn some of this and need to learn about the war on terror they need to learn who are played a role they need to learn that there are ground zero workers dying today because of the health implications that got from working on the site for so many months\nAnd all of that can happen with this memorial because it's more than just putting one name up there or just the the all of the names from nine eleven on that day it there's so many other quote unquote tentacles to this memorial\nMemorials or just started you know there are ways of of ah remembering and um I think um so that's that's why I'm so excited about the project and I I Hope that to other people will be exciting to contribute to it Eric how do you find out how you find the book\nOn Amazon or just plug in ah my name or or or just a few states away do you miss your news reporting day I Do I Do I miss I still do a little bit of writing but I Wish I could do

four seven nine nine one six twenty donate today great cause it will be a great memorial and I I Do love the fact that it connects us\nThe fourth one four seven nine nine one six twenty donate today great cause it will be a great memorial and I I Do love the fact that it connects us\nNot only to what happens to the government family but you all the people that suffer after nine eleven and a and teachers as well a great teaching moment for our country in the midst of all the things we talk about every day more next right near the ...\nWednesday forty degrees me forty degrees at Radio City nice where you\nAre and you're listening to the program thanks as always for listening [noise] I shouldn't have gotten away from talking about Hillary Clinton because frankly it serves not not much purpose but um\nI Can't let this moment pass so we're talking about the me too movement\nUm all the things that I ... you know the necessary or changes in the relationship between men and women in this country the fact of uh the the the the bad guys have been called out publicly many cases losing their jobs at a higher level winds dean Charlie Rose Bill O'Reilly\nMatt Lauer I mean there's a list is long but then you talk about bill and Hillary Clinton so Hillary was interviewed\nBy a by CBS a reporter the other day it aired on Sunday and at one point they um they go to the the the bill question right in the midst of all this meets his stuff\nAnd they asked her should her husband former President Bill Clinton have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and ah she\nDidn't have that same absolutely nuts and I'm sitting there watching this same gang you didn't leave it at that you actually went after these women who I think most historians\nReasonable rational Citizens United states I think we're probably telling the truth 'cause you just leave it at while he shouldn't resigned you went after these women at the time so how is it that\nA woman who was who was was seen as this icon of women's rights and uh you know shattering the glass ceiling to the point where she actually have this whole ... set design waiting on election night debate Franken ever got to use\nWhich played on the uh the females shattering glass ceiling\nGets away with these kind of response and it's hard not to think that the reason she gets away with it is because she's a Democrat\nThe behavior of the president's\nWas so far beyond a consensual acts as much as what you also said\nIt was about power about taking advantage of a young woman in that power such situation of power dynamic\nThe very essence of really what the me too movement is a boats so for almost Hillary Clinton lovers of defenders which who I Know are out there how do you reconcile that how do you\nMake the case that what she did at that time didn't damage women's ability to come forward didn't hurt the cause when it comes to women's rights\nNow it is different when you're in a married relationship you tempt people do tend to defend their spouse not always but it's not unusual but after the fact all these years later\nCalling us a consensual relationship\n\nAnd that doesn't mean that he forced her to do something but it does suggest that there was a power dynamic here which pushed into that act\nIs the very essence of what the me too movement is about and for Hillary Clinton failed presidential candidates know apparently a multi millionaire on the lecture circuits\nYou know what I'm saying this is just a quick aside if I see one more of her campaign staff as a paid political expert on a network I Will stop watching that network\nThese people lost the most winnable election and us presidential history they screwed up and elections and I I'm fine with it because it ultimately Memphis she was going to be president but yet they're looked upon of experts on national media reports give me a break\n\nShe's making excuses her husband at the time president I'd states most powerful man in the world Monica Lewinsky twenty two years old\nThat power dynamic is real\nAs I said at the essence of what the me too movement is about in for her to deny that will pretend that there was nothing to see their another reason not to trust Hillary Clinton you're more than welcome to try to defend it I'm not going to spend any more time on because frankly given enough time already\nAnd to the folks who pay money to see her speak why after the break before I attend the four biggest stories we see it across Milwaukee the state in the world more brewers of course Canada makes it official and where my conservative friends\nThat with the U.S deficit on the rise that's all coming up the for our town right here at the ...\nWay we used to be with you on this Wednesday edition forty degrees at Radio City [noise] somebody's stayed up\nLate last night thirteenth any use of the Dodgers beat the brewers two to one [noise]\nFull disclosure I went to bed a little bit further than that\nHad been in Clinton's gave me it would have stayed up for it and of course\nOf course but was games for about seven game series so for a lot of us we woke up to the news of the Dodgers had won in game for now or even a series or to to to to with the big guys decisive game which you seem to slice of the pivotal gains today's pivotal um [noise]\nIn Chavez Ravine Dodger Stadium so one of the big back stories or side stories was the son many Machado incident first base\nHe takes the legs to try to take the legs out of his shoes and you are and um [noise] of course that you always replacing that earlier had a very strong opinion call them a dirty player dirty plays in this series\nWell hey sewers apparently talked to many of which are a little bit of a different take he says they're all good and what was your view of what\nNothing with this issue that we're talking\nTo the surface [noise]\nI don't know but we're done with it [noise] I don't know much all of them are long handle already tells them\nTo be good news is in\nThe last I mean there you go\nAnd I was just for showing me a\nLoan and really well I'm already passed\n[noise] we turn the page um we've got to come tomorrow they're going to be more\nThat we thought like when he when he got the baby and lay off any and everything is fine [noise] forty here for ... years okay with that one I got so many people ... that aren't they while he did but uh [laughter]\nYou'll see the game is just a game you know English wrong already taught um we've been really yeah everybody's fear may\nGuys are absolutely rage out for us you can hear it all as I sat right here in the ... after the break Canada makes it official and I'm asked the question is half the population high today that story next for a town right here to Jim Jim\nWright jaded you walk into his team made it to the world series this real is we'd go even farther jetlag I think the answer's yes gives us an explanation at twelve cents a day they can go farther [noise] gotta get it done though it was the officers with the Dodgers tied at two games of peace will be a pivotal game five\nComing out a little bit later right here in WGM Jay [noise]\nUm this started talking about this last week and I I use the example that um you know as the United states Russell's in wrangled with the idea of legalization of marijuana we have a great test case happening\nAs we speak in a country of Canada and I don't know I say says what three hundred fifty million people Canada has thirty seven nine people so you know there's a little bit of an imbalance there and population\nBut as of midnight last night at twelve o one\nOne hundred and eleven illegal pot shops open across the nation of Canada no stores in Ontario they're still trying to figure out the the rules and regulations they'll have some open in spring and are just so everybody knows that we're talking about medical marijuana has been legal since two thousand one again and so this is recreational marijuana\nWe've seen the United states states have gone to this recreational marijuana lots of states have medicinal marijuana I'm a big fan of that I think it's important that we do that\nBut a recreational marijuana is a completely different thing you can even order it never sitting right to your door\nYeah they also um anybody that was in in a custody but had I was at thirty grams there are now being released for possession\nA great story from Vicki Barker this is thirty seconds that you will not forget check this out as the clocks\nThere are now being being released for possession of a great story from Vicki Barker this is thirty seconds that you will not forget check\nThis out as the clock struck midnight [noise] and that became the world's largest legal marijuana marketplace this is like the end of prohibition for alcohol pretty much\nI feel magnificent marvelous [noise]\nA little bit bland me and I was in\nThe long means Taiwan marijuana I did not know what she was saying I have to look it up Canada also plans to park and all those can look it up to thirty grounds for marijuana there now legal threshold Vicki\nBarker CBS means [laughter] that'd be LVN she looked it up for us [laughter]\nInteresting or something every day for the candidates they've been working on this thing for two years there are led by prime minister Justin Trudeau plan for legalization or they want us to get out of the black market into more regulated system what's the big reason money dollars taxes um billions of dollars in investments\nAnd it comes back within a chance for a country of Canada to make money as I said before nine us states have\nLegal recreational marijuana thirty\nHave medicinal marijuana so that that Titus has been turning in this country a towards legalization of marijuana but we're going to find out again smaller sample size but still thirty seven million people in Canada mostly live within Ninety percent live with a hundred miles of the border\nSo there is some similarities in the conduct in the culture there\nHow that works for them and that could have studied correctly improperly with ... with good research good numbers tell us how these uh legalization of France the United states could or could play on what they might mean for the rest of us as I've said over and over again big fan of it is so marijuana not so much recreational\nAnd uh we'll see in Canada\nIf indeed half the population is walking around high all the time what that means for production for them to have any [laughter]\nRecreation blame him\nFor the state of blend something we learned about today when I uh and surprising young reporter so Canada legal recreational marijuana marijuana effective today the future is rights or maybe doll depending on your point of view in Canada so that's number three our four at San coming up after the break\nUS deficit rising in the United states the highest level since twenty twelve so what does this mean and where's all my conservative friends on this issue right physical conservatism fiscal responsibility\nTax reform packages that contributing to this issue\nI might go a different way we spend too much money in this country way too much money and we're really lousy with the great a test case for the uh the health care discussion I think at the current system in programs we have we do a lousy job of managing those lousy horrible\nAnd we're going to throw another one in the mix that's why we have\nThe deficit that is rising not tax reform too much spending\nHunter and African unfortunate five hour Thirteen any game for a loss of Los Angeles the bruising Dodgers are back at it for game five less than twenty four hours later series all score at two games apiece 'cause Holocene Bob ... is on the call once again and our coverage starts\nRight here in the ... two o'clock this afternoon re ...\nGot to get it done game five pivotal game it's my new favorite word pivotal got to get it done to to the team that wins today has the uh the leg up the advantage going into the last two games if needed at Miller Park in Milwaukee coming up this weekend so big stuff\nFrom our Milwaukee Brewers and we and we love the show before ten with all of our brewers coverage or wanted to wrap up the fourth time with this story because you're gonna you're gonna hear this reporter and a lot of different ways\nSo US deficit up Seventeen percent highest level of an increased since twenty twelve deficit rose to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in physical you're twenty eight see I'm Seventy percent from last year according to figures released by the Treasury Department\nSo one of the big things talking points both by people running for office elected officials even the media is that just because of the Republican's tax cuts\nAnd it is true that Seventy six billion dollars less were collected but that drop is offset by increased revenues from individual and self employment taxes\nSo\nThis notion that the tax reform package causes deficit is specious and not true the issue spending\nRose three percent over the previous year\nOne of the biggest things I'm a I'm a big supporter of the defense budget but they have huge increases and these are all agreed upon in September of twenty Seventeen is a deal between Republicans and Democrats too you know you remember that story to head off a government shutdown\nSocial Security interest on the central down that's also a contribute to this increased\nSo don't let anybody tell you that's a tax reform package that's actually for a package is what's driving this economy\nFor the first time in a long time businesses have shaken off the shackles of government over regulation over taxation over burdensome a review\nAnd said you know we're going to add employees were going to add to our facilities build new buildings pay our people more and we've seen these stories play out since December of twenty Seventeen and a lot of different levels\nNobody nobody wants to see deaths\nEspecially from the federal government because as I said this number gets bigger and bigger and bigger but the answer or the blame has nothing to do with the tax cuts and has to do with the fact that we spend too much\nI set for a long time\nEvery dollar that spent by the federal government should be examines case by case program my program dollar by dollar\nAnd a a real Congress one that actually the voters would have trust him with say All right we've paid for this for a long time is it working has it affected his actually accomplish anything if not\nIt stops but what I what do\nI always say about this the government is very good instituting programs new programs they're not very good at managing the ones they have and this has been a constant problem since many of the big government programs were initiated in the twentieth century\nDoesn't mean the government's not important or vital in in our economy works they have roles to play\n\nIn a job to do when it comes to driving success both in the governments and for business and for the taxpayers\nBut don't take the empty had an argument that the Republican backed a tax cut that led to this deficit we're spending too much money and to call on my Republican conservative friends you're contributing to this problem\nAnd all the ways\nThat you should frankly be smarter about well it's easy to put money into programs like the defense budgets because we can always be a less safe by not doing that\nExamine what you spend think about the dollars use them for all the uh the laziness does happen on on reform of programs like Medicare Medicaid Social security others that day is going to come would you rather have the pain now\nOr the extreme pain when the when those programs start to run into some real cash flow\nProblems big big stories often not covered in the way they should be and this is another example that's where I wanted to read this deficit started because it's going to be played out as let's blame Republicans when in fact\nEvery party every politician of the national level is is to blame because we're spending too much money as a government and that has to change and that's really what fiscal conservative it isn't about", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "17"}
