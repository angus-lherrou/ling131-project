federal flood insurance program is subsidized by your a fellow taxpayers you're the floods smart dot Gov you'll see how it works and remember higher ground is a better idea Susan is with\nUs on the Clark Howard show hello Susan how are you today on Susan you want to talk about your family members what's going on with them\nWell I have a couple of family members that have high chairs and one of them got till the time shows trauma and could now why are you\nAnd why high chair they're faking late fall and if a a very popular name and that's got the limit and now they're a lot of emails a folk yet of trying to do and there's a Web site and I think some of those\nOn the up and getting the right to deal with high chair\nRight so let me just lay it straight out to you Susan I'm your relative is pretty much stuck with those weeks\n\nTime shares are are virtually completely on sellable\nAnd even at a time share that was sold by a well known and recognize brand like some of the hotel chains were in that business for a while even in those cases the value of a time share that you purchase declines by almost a hundred percent the second is purchased\nSo anyway the any of the offers that they receive saying oh we're going to help you sell your time share we've got a buyer indentified when a sell it for X number of dollars all we need from you as to pay us this listing fee or this money or whatever\nThey're all bogus they're all scams\nAnd what I recommend it in the past and it still is holes as true right now is your relatives need to use their weeks and get some value out of them\nWill call it a point I guess that a wait\nDo they have trouble redeeming their points or they don't try\nNow they are using now why why they don't really have any need for they had a transfer from there\nWhich means they are they are the nicest people to do that because they took a burden from their hand but there was something they can't now on burden themselves from\nGenerally if you want somebody to take over a timeshare week not only be paid for that week but then you have to turn around and pay them usually in the thousands of dollars to take it over time share weeks or points have a negative value\nBecause you're entering into an obligation that goes on and on and on and on and you have no control what the fees are going to be for that obligation\nTo fly during our show that was the last show for a a Web site\nOh well let me tell you it's funny I'm so glad you mentioned that because we just talked about this on the show recently is that I don't even know who's advertising on the show or our website\nAlso an ad that appears in it the way ads are placed I don't even know who's doing that are you aware of the ads are coming for all I Know where they come from but I don't know who's running ads and it could even be a local ad not one of my show ads\nSo I Know that that there's no method that I Know of where you can actually make money\nSelling a timeshare weaker selling timeshare points because it is a a it's a defective market you know it's something for every thousand sellers there's not even a buyer\nSo what I Would say is they need to find a use for that second week\nAnd start using it or even give it to other relatives to use the weeks as long as I'll pay the annual fees for it and one other idea that has worked for some people saw repeat it is that if you go stay at your time share week while you're there there are other people who love time shares I made a lot of that place\nAnd they may be willing to take on the obligation and have you sign it over to them you're not going to make any money\nBut you'll end the obligation for the week and that's usually the best you can hope for with a time share I've also mentioned fake Keisha\nV. A. C. H. T. I. A. which is kind of like a bulletin board for people trying to buy and ah well they don't really buy 'em they get time shares and people trying to unload time shares and you could check that out Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael\nYes I Am proud of it had in mind going on for years and a three years ago and that's why it's not a purchaser life\nAnd a cricket by federal outlay and releases coming up your mind is a um a warning about the battery life but how long does it matter laughing I watched it cost to place and more about a mile long after oh\nOkay so ah let's deal with all that and the reverse order\nTurn near the end when the leases or even if you love it because they're on CSI jewel and your leases if it's like most of the Nissan Leaf says I've heard about would require you to pay somewhere in the mid teens to buy your leaf at the end of the least\nSad about the right man for yours\nAbout yeah OK because of right now you can buy a use leaf of an age probably similar to your three year old when you're turning in for somewhere six seven or eight thousand dollars 'cause they use leaf market is flooded so if you love your ...\nYou're probably gonna find it's better to dump peers and by another three year old when it less than half the cost you pay under residual now I'm having terrible battery problems with my belief\nThe range of it has reduced dramatically and it it it's a problem because I've really got to think about where the trip if I can take it in the leaf\nAnd mine was a very very early production model it was not a pre production but it's one of the first ones\nWere pretty much commercially available in the U.S and I've heard that the batteries on the early ones like mine are very unreliable and have deteriorated quite rapidly but other people with newer where you have not reported that problem at all\nBut if you do follow my suggestion turning the leaf you have when you go to buy another one you know there's that dial to the right hand side of where you charge relief that will show you how much the leaf battery has deteriorated and if it's still at a hundred percent strain\nYou will be fined buying that as a use leaf but it's had a significant loss and the capacity of the battery if it's really deteriorated don't buy that one Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you\nI'm fine how are you\nGreat thank you you have a question for me about arbitration\nYeah you know I listen to your show a lot and I know that you've talked about arbitration in a doctor's office or when you signed paperwork and stuff but I'm looking to get a new on my house and I'm getting a couple of bits and more of a bit I got\nA contract that the contractors certainly has binding arbitration in it and I think you always kind of talk down about that\nAnd I do talk down arbitration because when they impose on you they probably picked the forum for arbitration in there\nAnd the reason it's such a rotten system is that if you agree to their arbitration and they picked the arbitrator the arbitrator only makes money\nIf they keep getting the business well so arbitrators have an unholy alliance with the businesses that select the arbitration panels because if they don't find the business they don't get work anymore\nShe'll put yourself in the cellar shoes for a minute\nWhich offered you choose typically those that are contingent on the sale of the buyers current home get tossed but that's where I can I can help out with a bridge loan so you don't have to sell before buying of course prices important but then there's the strength of the pre approval letter and the reputation of the winter\nThat's where I can is rock solid guaranteed pre approval really helps real estate agents you know they can rely on an academic rock solid pre approval because we tell the seller in writing we've\nVerified everything about you not just your credit score like most banks and credit unions and then we guarantee in writing that if\nWe can make good on our pre approval letter will pay per view and the seller a thousand bucks each no other letter stands behind their pre approved buyers like actor that make your offer the best offer with a rock solid guaranteed pre approval from our best ACC U.

would be a classic buyer's market and then kind of in between is where it to the equilibrium\nClose to where we are like ... all shaded or you said this is a condo right yes yeah where we have a house or I saw an old right\nNow it will likely to possibly let out my house for shell and move into the condo\nAh alright so where does your house fit and the price point\nA to my house is shaking ... of the you know showing it in the Congo\nWell I mean that's a lifestyle choice if he really liked the condo you haven't really had a lot of fun renting it out\nThen that's something people do frequently where they have a home and investment property is they may decide to flip and move into the investment property the advantage to you with your own home his it appreciate and a lot in value yes\nSo if you salad that advantage because you get to pocket as a single individual a quarter million tax free a married couple five hundred thousand and gain tax free if you hold on to that and converted into a rental property eventually you lose that\nSo if you wanted to flip and move into the rental property if there's been a big gain on that house here and I would sell it\nAnd now he turned so\nWell again if it's a it's a more modest pricing point of view or area that's where homes are still selling very well\nOkay I I have to have that in that area so I have to figure out so I figure at the time they were asking what\nIs your best to you with what you end up doing and James joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi James\nI'm fourteen have that I find that hundred dollars a day and\nWhy why why why why you were fourteen and you already have twenty five hundred bucks how'd you do that\nTo collect money from Christmas and birthdays and now that I'm going on in the bank that time so\nYou when you have received money as a gift at holiday periods and for your birthday you don't spend it you save it\n[noise] I spend a little bit of it but I found out I had anything worthwhile lifestyles\nWell I don't like for you to meet my Thirteen year old son and teach him whatever it is you know because he by his own admission is a spender and I'd love it if you could re educate him to do what you've done which is to save money\nSo let's talk James the money you have this twenty five hundred what do you hope for it to be the Sunday what do you hope to use it for\nWell I Am right now having a credit union bank like hey let's get on there that two dollars a year and just write about trying to put in any trouble finding their CDs and trying to tell them money\nKen what do you hope at what point do you want to use the money we are you going to use it to buy a car when you turn sixteen or you saving it for maybe are going to college like what what's the purpose of the money in your life some day\nWell I finally not touching it felt like after college but I wasn't ready and you know well that that make it in the future to buy a car or\nRight and the reason I asked that is that you would would do very well putting money into a fund and letting it grow enough on and there are a variety of them that I like where you can put money in a you mentioned a mutual fund\nYeah I like for you to look at something known as an index fund index fund because it's not traded a lot you can have an an account and you don't worry about a lot of it being taxed while you have it in there\nFor a low the way that just gradually make some money\nWell this is great now one idea I've talked about in the past have you ever heard of a company called fidelity investments\nI have found out about them but I\nOut of Fidel already has an account with zero minimum and zero fees and you can put your money and to find that owns a little tiny pieces of most U.S companies and you don't I guess stock in like three thousand U.S companies\nAnd then they have another one was zero fees and zero minimum that puts money an international fund choices and you could go into a fidelity office you don't need someone who's an adult to go with you because they have to have what's known as custodian of it or you probably have a custodian\nArrangement up on that credit union account and you just go in there and they'll set that up for you know the thing about doing that kind of investing is in the shorter term over the next several years you have the stock market goes down your potentially in the short term\nShow that you've lost money was not real money until you sell\nBut if it's money I'll tell you about leaving alone for eight to ten years till you're done with school\nEight to ten years to you're done with school that's a great time period for you to look at putting money in there and you can add to it over time\nNow the only the only bad side of any of this I should tell you is that if you're going to go to college and apply for help for financial aid with college this money counts against you for that\nOkay I Can't tell you how excited I Am ... your age you're doing this and the reason I specifically mentioned fidelity\nIs that they have these choices with no cost and they have actual real officers you can go into and sit down with someone and having account there and have somebody you can talk to their and so it's a great way for you to learn and learn more\nBy having the place you can go and having the actual account\nSo as you go to LA and open one of the ...\n... no I Want you to open the fidelity zero index funds is what they're called yet but that will be zero and they'll when you walk in an office self signs everywhere for fidelity zero\nYeah so you just tell them that's what you want and uh I I Want to say to you I don't know if this came from inside you er visits come from your parents or wherever where you\nWould you prefer to read wrote getting on your

the start of the ministry ... she has now resigned that is the breaking news from CNN of course we will follow this and bring you more details as we get it I'm Eric bills that he's radio double duty I'm Jay [noise]\nGood morning Wisconsin away\nThese really with you on WGM Jay Seventy two degrees at Radio City thank you for listening I got I got to be honest that Nikki Haley news is stunning and you don't have a lot of details yet but uh [noise]\nA cat her fellow candidates in Tammy Baldwin sitting senator who has a if you believe the last ... double digit lead we know that the new polls coming out tomorrow we'll get to that in a second but is this the right strategy\nFor ... well I think so I think when you're when you're behind you have to go on the ... the offensive and that's exactly what what ... and she did a very effectively whether or not the debate is going to move people or whether or not it was just partisans watching the debate last night but\nIt was live near a chance to be to be on the stage state wide really for the first time a much broader audience and I think that she did a very effective job and taking it to Tammy Baldwin\nThe other big issue was immigration border security Tammy Baldwin had I had was asked directly by Leah Vukmir about what her plan was in in a effectively as well we use the term open borders and Democrats although they don't say that term\nAll the all the ideas and policies things they talk about just that's the reality but Tammy balls and raised in the issue of like a of technology being the answer and and related to the wall your your thoughts on where she was kind of going with that\nWell in Democrats talk about that that's an excuse to do nothing is that they're going to say well we could do this that and the other thing and then they never do it it's kind of like how they authorized border security but then they never pay for it in some border security never actually happens\nUm that's that's the Democratic playbook you sound like you're going to do something about illegal immigration which you're really not in Tammy Baldwin is been rather depth on the issue it avoids the whole thing about whether or not to abolish ice\nOr she's ... she's been saying that she is in favor of of abolishing ice with so many of our democratic colleagues at this point in our and if you don't have to have that police agency doing the immigration enforcement you have a lot of bad actors in this country and in Tammy Baldwin really needs the answer whether or not she disagrees with our colleagues\nLet me ask you voters question so as I said ... evolving effectively using the TV airwaves to tell her story to portray candidate\nThat those of us who actually dig into her to her work as a U.S senator understand as as fiction but does that work with the voters are they seeing these ads and thinking oh my God Tammy carrot cares about me as an individual and is that the way you you when these elections\nWhen I found was really interesting was how much leader who spent last night talking about how Tammy doesn't care and how much Leah does care I mean and she was when she was talking about being a nurse she was talking about very specific examples from or nursing experience and but also\nShe was talking about how Tammy Baldwin says one thing in Washington DC and says something else when she's back home training really stress the fact that there's that there's a divorce between the Tammy Baldwin that's on the commercials and the Tammy ... the real senator Tammy Baldwin the during the debate leader was very good at at pushing that point\nOne of the things I've said about Santa Barbara for a while as a follower or not a leader as a new center and that's not unusual but typically when you're good at what you do whether it's politics or what our private sector or whatever it is\nAt some point the leaders emerged and I just don't see those qualities and Tammy Baldwin but yet it still seems to be playing with the voters in Wisconsin can can live ... flip that switch and turn that around\nWell I think so when you look at whether Ron Johnson did in his first term compared to Tammy Baldwin in her first term it's it's a difference of night and day we had a very effective senator Senator Ron Johnson we had a very ineffective senator and Tammy Baldwin\nA she's still proposed and things that that Republicans propose an effort to try and curry favor with the voters but she's not going to move on those issues either she only gets things done when she absolutely has to win it's election time and that's when she comes up with things but as we saw last night she really doesn't have a command of those issues\nWhat's what's ... what's your biggest vulnerability ... looking at Tammy Baldwin's campaign and her tenure as you as a U.S senator what's your biggest vulnerability\nThing or biggest vulnerability was the fact that the ... already had eaten Colorado so there were more people tuned in when I find it as a result of that debate right after the ... that we're actually playing last night Tammy Baldwin would have been a lot better off and she'd better hope that the brewers are playing the same night as the next debate\nI again I I started a couple of times already and in the hour or so I've been on the air that I was I was shocked at how bad she was at a debate that she should have been prepared for given all the time she had to get ready for this thing and and the inability to answer simple questions\nTo stumble over answers that clearly memorize some information that ... and I'll go back to this point memorizing things is good if you're if you're a good speaker but if you're not a good speaker what it what happens is that exposes your lack of experience and your lack of knowledge about a subject that's what I think got exposed last night well\nThe interesting thing to me is is that with all of her experiences as being a senator or she clearly wasn't too prepared for last night and that that says to me something about the way that she's been handling our job it seems to be\nI'm going to coast through I'm going to get the five years and\nYou know for somebody who's actually though than than panicking about her child ever since the tone of a scandal you would have thought that she had been better prepared did you ... her responses to that issue came up no it really if you do this has been a a cleanup job every sense and I think the live nearby challenging area of the way that she did\nA really drove that issue home and are\nYou one thing we got to say about the moderators last night those were not hard questions and even even revoke there should have handled the equal pay question better right I mean that was her big weak point of the evening but those were pretty softball questions we're not talking about that she got grilled by by the attorney last night there wasn't a\nQuestionnaire that they shouldn't have expected right in the subject matter was one of the health care\nExpected right the subject matter was one of the health care first Fifteen minutes everybody knew that was common immigration port security those were not

social media or one of the one of the reporter said that she's going to read at the end of the year uh they quoted president Donald Trump's as saying she wants to take a break\nIn quotes take a break a she has officially resigned as US ambassador to the un it's if it's actually studying news\nThis is somebody Nikki Haley former South Carolina Governor a UN ambassador I thought was one of those front runners in the future for the Republican Party now that I mean she that can't be the case and they're gonna be a lot of reasons for this break hopefully we'll find out more about that but\nIt's a stunning news especially as one of the reporters said right before the midterm elections\nThe timing is not good and another another a reporter indicating that both chief of staff John Kelly and vice president my parents were taken by surprise by this announcement so clearly some stunning news from the White House and as I said well taken update hearing a few minutes\nNow what does it matter that the midterms are coming up to do voters really think of Nikki Haley when they're voting for our congressmen or whatever they're doing\nThat Nikki Haley per se but I'm certain see what's an administration complains of people's fears on ideas about about elections in politics I think anything that dilutes the message is not good if it if it could be perceived and I I I'm just a speculation sure if it can be perceived as a banning the shipper jumping ship\nThat's not a good thing is as we know the president has a lot of has had a lot of turnover in his administration\nGenerally you know weeks or months in advance there's rumor that swirls about it right in this case there were no rumors it just kind of came out of nowhere\nNo as I said a rising star

ABC's Karen drivers is that the White House and tells us not long ago Haley wrote a newspaper column about her relationship with the president\nI live in New York Times published a scathing critical and ... and it's not bad for an author that said they were a senior ... responded with her own are bad writing in the Washington her she said that when she had to just eat with President Trump She

ABC News the White House\nHaley wasn't always the Trump supporter during the twenty sixteen campaigns you endorsed his rival Marco Rubio for the GOP nomination again Haley stepping down as UN ambassador Scott Goldberg ABC News\nSo right now we're getting our first look at the conversation from earlier in the oval office President Trump city he's been\nHe's flanked by Nikki Haley both them sitting in chairs by the fireplace there in the oval office let's dip into that conversation to everybody that you have to speak to the president I think that initially discussing hurricane Michael preparations\nPrepared [noise] I wanted to do this because Nikki Haley\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job\nShe's a fantastic person very important but she also is somebody that gets it and she has been [noise] at the United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and worked with us so they can famous than really a long time very intense and\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know [noise] maybe at the end of the year the end of the two year period at the end of the year I wanted to take a little time off or what but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise]\nFor eight years and then she um she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world and very dangerous when a lot of things [noise]\nBut she's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems that we're in the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning or North Korea was a massive problem\nWe're moving along and I'm I'm really nicely I can speak for secretary of state Mike Pompeo he thinks the world of next year and they're so we're all we're all happy for you in one way or we have to lose ... hopefully you'll become a back if someone\nGave me a different fast as you can have your ... [noise] but uh I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the year next year will be leaving\nThe next year will be leaving and they will be in constant touch\nI Know that would be out of there there's you\nAll the players that that was really the thing I think she did best in the United nations you got to know the players she got to know China Russia India she knows\nEverybody that are very first day basis or they're like [noise] except for maybe a couple of\nGhetto life because they they do they really like it I think maybe more importantly they respect her so the gear just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will unless you nevertheless or you'll get a job but I\nMuch [noise] well\nI Want to say on that first of all I Want to thank\nJust you know allowing us to come out and talk to you this way and it has been an honor and a lifetime at you know I that\nLeave if they raised me and to serve\nBeen a blessing and I want to thank you for that matter most excited we'll get to a few years look at what has\nFor the United states on foreign policy now the United states\nDo they know that if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other country half a pay their share\nI mean whether the trade deal with the main thing they yes at the time that means that that's and they've all over\nJust the two years at the un one\nThree billion and the un like\nMade a song that we made it more\nSouth than we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nGreen North Korean sanctions um\nWhich we're the largest and generation done in a way that we can really work\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook falling to add things they're doing do you have to see them for the threat that they are um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the strike and courage that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we\nWhere we want to put our\nAnd you know all of those same has made a huge difference in the U.S but I can tell you that I'm going\nAnd the U.S is drawing in a way that should make math and very proud and I didn't want to say that it's not just\nFor that family in general the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me um I Can't say enough good things about Jared Nirvana got scary it is such a\nSenior no one understand I mean to region after the all the way he began I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably\nJust a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because there and I'm David minister I should I also just half a day I'm certainly thank you my family Michael at the same\nAnd my two little ones I adore them entertained us you when you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but and they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud and so with that\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything has been good flakes\nOn for the next disaster to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to then part of the team now I don't have anything sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when I was\nSix years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand your blood at church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in and just a few years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense\nTime and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be dealt with enough to know when you step\nI Will say that um are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for trying twenty I can promise you what are we doing it for that point so I look forward to supporting the president\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley just moments ago from the oval office and now dean right there she is not running for president in twenty twenty and said she says she's going to campaign for this one and she was pointing that President Trump\nWhen she said that UN ambassador Nikki Haley will resign she will step down at the end of the debate team to do time in a way\nResolve headed to me and I'll see\nBorders WGM Jay\nThis report sponsored by Mr Helen's heating and air conditioning visit Mr day is an extraordinary day for Wisconsin Gina below from Bella is here with news it will blow your mind\nAnd they've had a lot of experience and you'd make new socks Lorenzo Cain of one man one world series championships together Curtis Granderson and Senate and a number of World Series and important long postseason series as well\nWhen you have experience that got a ton of experience that aspect to them and even their young guys or Leno RCN who a home run against Wade Davis a couple of days ago against Colorado He's played very well so far in the postseason became one\nSixty tree in Chicago to wait for it\nI think that really I'm really enjoying a lot of of the experience from the brewers clubhouse Craig counts of course has that much postseason experiences anybody score to run a that was against the Cleveland Indians remember the Marlins had a big hit the diamond backs of course when they went down to the one\nSo they play really have to play with that that's the way the brewers teams played for the last couple of years and\nAnd I don't think that's going to change even when the CFPB starts on friday night at the park\nAnd we moved from a five game series justified the best of seven other than the number of games what's what's the changes for the manager was to the change in approach for the players in the best of seven series\nI think the biggest change is that you have three consecutive game for three four five in the road ballparks the brewers have home field advantage but only play the games at home but any stretch the look at wanting to know Clark and then have to go to Dodger Stadium three four five\nBecause you have three straight games you might have to add another starting pitcher to the roster brewers have friday ... neither pitch\nIn Rio de ask 'em to those those might be a couple of guys that factor into this ... um is on the roster ... who's on the roster so\nThere will be some changes in terms of the out get her group quote unquote I don't see the position player group changing much but the the pitching staff is going to change a little bit going into games\nI'm going to seven games is because the five years\nUntil you Bruce announcing Jeff Weber got a couple of minutes left so as we get set for friday both teams will be well rested that their pitchers will be positioned appropriately to give you the best chance of winning what other what other things go into these these days leading up to uh to the next series when you're when you're not playing baseball\nDo you have to still maintain that high level of practice how how does that all all shakedown\nWell a lot of people talk about that that because the government they are if you lose your your battles\nTest that's your um your we I I don't want to say will cause that's not that's not right but just you haven't seen the life or so to speak\nTo the brewers are taken today off they had yesterday off of course for travel there's light workout it's not mandatory day there will be a workout to borrowing a workout on Thursday batting practice it and go overseas county records that stuff's already going on a British front office the scouts the advance scouts already put their reports together\nUm and it just looking at this point you're down to the final three teams with the red Sox Yankees they're determined that series\nSo you're you're one of the final two teams in the national league there are no secrets at this point you faced each other within the last couple of months a ... it's just a matter of a gang finally to the ... round balls\nI'm taking your batting practice getting the bullpen and and I think those are really important things to do and um now I think the brewer just it it's these couple of days are going to be really important to both and they get their rats\nJeremy ... and ... story they all pitched in in all three games a division series on couple of days off of them get your ... uh a lot of good\nJust LeBron was announcer great to talk to you enjoy calling your first and they all cs this weekend I appreciate that and

irritate the millennials in the audience you also have to be willing to listen to other people all generations can do better at that including my generation\nSo all generations could be better at that but I just noticed millennials little touch ya on several the political issues are a number three or four at ten hurricane Michael set to make landfall\nUpdated category ... storm now Eric bearing down on the Florida Panhandle governor Rick Scott now no telling people use some of the people you've got to get out of there\nYeah and there's concern of a storm surge on this one is well not nearly as high as the Carolina one this one is about ten to twelve foot storm surge that they're worried about obviously some of these areas are prepared for that type of thing\nAlso what makes this storm different than Florence the one that hit the Carolinas is that it's moving a lot faster if you recall Florence was just moving slow and slower than just sat there for a while\nMichael he's moving quick and should blow through the Syria very fast which will be helpful you won't have as much as the green situation that we saw earlier\nYeah and I ... I used to live in Florida in the mid eighties and in in the Tampa area Clearwater area and I didn't have a hurricane but it had a a a tropical storm and and it is amazing because a lot of those areas along\nThe shore are very low lying so any storm surge a lot of those areas have been protected they have they have residences that are lifted up like the casinos are actually the the parking is is that the bottom so they dealt with this before but when you're moving that many people out of this region and I've seen numbers like a hundred thousand plus people\nYou've got high winds sustain it a hundred and ten miles an hour the risk is significance\nAnd it seems like you've had it at a few of these storms this year uh there's always the question now is is the climate is changing the the weather read that's not going to go away that that debate is going to happen forever but uh we we've seen\nIt's been a relatively normal season I Would say it's not ... at least in the classroom and a lot more hurricanes but this is more normal but as Michael approaches lots of folks in the Florida Panhandle bracing for what what what could be a major hurricane and it seems to be very strong so the winds are strong as I said and the good thing is\nPeople are planning for these things probably better than they've ever done before I think the communication is better of FEMA the federal emergency management association for ... they're they're telling people the right thing getting that people out\nIf it makes landfall as a cat three you're talking about some pretty significant ... anywhere from Destin, Florida so Appalachia bay\nA then supposed to go north eastern Georgia in the Carolinas where the Carolinas they're still recovering from their hurricane and and that flooding which raised you know happening\nTo some degree that don't don't do that water level has not gone down what are they call it a thousand year flood event when one of these hurricanes comes comes to town so as you can imagine gas generators water all the emergency pies sold out in many places but that part of the country they're not a\nThis is not a unique story but the one that they had to face a few times yeah in twenty eight teams they're prepared they'll handle it yeah so hurricane Michael\nAh hopefully will not do as much damage as we've seen some of the the previous hurricanes the Houston's in them and uh you know the Puerto Rican hurricanes of last year so we're monitor that story as it prepares to make landfall somewhere\nIn Florida and the next few days Morrow tomorrow yeah uh that's over three of our for it's coming up after the break\nAnd you know I can make thirty dollars an hour in the production um peace rate part of the business\nSo some potential there for some people make

they get there they don't get their way mission sturgeon bay\nAll you have to see how the left and they're sending operatives whipped up gender hatred hysteria didn't during the Kavanaugh debacle and using their continuous race being to bite us in a demonstrates they will do anything to gain power and house Trump how are we not already in a political civil war that's that's a good question there Mitch\nOr just from Fox point I think it's more comparable to a Cold War than a civil war I don't see liberals and conservatives blowing each other up with cameras but there are a lot of underhanded things going on and not as violent efforts going on as well\nFrom the two six to we've already been in the civil war started eight years ago and continues to put it simply I'm Republican and I can't go on a public and say that I'm a Republican because ... society look down on me\nI experienced is going through grad school I disconnect my Facebook and in order to talk about politics because I Am demonized because I'm On the right that's one of the reasons I brought this up\nI started to notice and it's part of the the process of having a show on on a big fish and went to a gym Jay people start to attack you not on the personal stuff although they they do that as well but on the policy decisions that you support or indoors or in some cases just post even if you share an article\nYou're then supposedly espousing a position as dangerous or extreme or evil is is the is the word of the day I just when it comes to\nHow people approach politics\nIs an evil to have a different opinion on policy and that's I think where the storyline is taken us Republicans have been painted by Democrats and liberals as being wrong on the issues social issues\nIssues like health care immigration and they've used social media to into a great extent to to um to play out that battle\nTo cast anyone who has a different opinion as one of those names that throughout earlier\nAnd I and I've seen it pop up all over the place you can go to a public events and people are often shy about indicating their political affiliation because it becomes more about that than the actual person and I think that's where the breakdown is happening\nIs it the stories go back a couple of years\nThe women in ... in uh in California who could no longer associate with neighbors could no longer go to a party if someone was there that supported the this president\nThat's the new reality here\nAnd if you think there's it's we're better off with one party or one way of looking at things it was dangerous implications to that diversity opinion is important for a lot of different reasons the main one you get a better product\nAt the end better policy at the end when you have a diversity of opinions let's go to a Christian from Sheboygan W teams are good morning Christian\nRight Steve how are you good what do you think\nWell I think that I think we are on the verge of a Cold War a political or whatever you want to call it but I don't think one of the other is to blame I think that what I Am fine thank you had to Kavanaugh was pretty disgusting I also think that leader who are running ads going Jerry Moran reporter him carry\nIs equally disgusting and I I think that we're getting to the point that conservatives are playing the victim are just as much as we are\nSo how do we fix it if if you think it should be effects\nWell I think that we got to start having several conversations with each other and talking to each other and the poor people and now is if we're on one side of the other and um\nAnd I and I think that that's that's got to come from both sides I also think that er you know three times in a row a United States as a whole have voted for liberal representation at the presidential level but in the last several Supreme Court nominees we've gotten conservative that like\nThe car and going in the opposite direction of what public only I'm not saying get rid of the electoral college Trump is an illegitimate president I think like them than our government isn't representing where people are voting for him and I think that the root of all the problems\nRight well thanks for the call Christian you know one of the reasons I bring this up is because I'm interested in civil conversation I think it's so possible and it it does bother me when I see people unable to have a civil conversation on social media because I think that's one of the platforms than where we could actually benefit from from some back and forth unfortunately\nIt's taken over by what people I call her social media terrorists they want to blow up conversations they want to be\nReally not truth tellers but opinion spreaders where the opinion is if you don't agree with me you're somebody that evil hate filled you you put you put a descriptive term there or whatever when you'd like that's the problem that's\nThe issue social media is an amazing\nNew way to communicate but we're so bad at it let me take a quick break but got more calls more tax on the conversation where else on Facebook those folks want to check us out there where does this go\nAs some of the causes that we may be in a

it's an on civil war that's missing from sturgeon bay yeah maybe how do we fix it do we want to fix it whereas one side\nBoth sides think they're right therefore they don't require any fixing or maintenance of this instability we see playing out across the country let's go to ... and Franks ville you're on WGM Jacob ... good morning what do you tell just\nA comment on basically it revolves around the Brett Kavanaugh issue give Mitch McConnell had chosen to not use the nuclear option where you had to have sixty votes it would not have been so contentious\nOkay so I guess where do we go from here the reality is that the rules now that's the way it works where do we go from your how do we how do we improve the dialogue between both parties because as you and I both know if it doesn't improve the chances of getting any significant legislation done an immigration or health care [noise] probably aren't going to be too likely\nKnow it it it it has gone so far both direct and not not

for the call PetSmart caught you know to be honest [noise]\nWell it seems unlikely that might be a scenario maybe a splinter Republican group that comes off I mean what many much of the anger has been directed towards this president and I I've been saying for a while\nProtect us citizens are population they failed miserably in many ways of getting in the way of fixing that issue you may think strongly that Republicans are evil and racist and all the other things I have talked about\nThere's plenty of great Republicans were going about their lives raising her family's making a living creating jobs\nWho may not even like this president but the alternative was worse at least in their minds and in my mind\nYou don't have to like it but if you're going to continually take the mindset that the other party is bad and I I Know a lot of Democrats they're not bad people I think they're mistaken on some things\nBut they have they also have some legitimate ideas that I think are are worthy of a vetting and ... and trying to see if they'll work and I'm I'm a strong advocate of actually making the process work as it was designed to\nBecause that's clearly not the case now\nSo when I raised the issue of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and how Christine Blasey Ford was treated if you're going to defend women to the point where you're going to believe all women and which is apparently what some people want to do\nWhy don't you go the extra step and question why a woman who whose identity she asked to be kept confidential was not protected by Dianne Feinstein by her staff by other Democrats why isn't that something you're concerned about\nSo that now this woman who could have done this in privates tell her story was outed\nIn front of international media why is that not a concern to you\nAnd the Republicans are so evil why are we more concerned about that than you are so there's there's a lot of new ones these stories a lot of details that have to be figured out\nIt's not so easy to just condemn one side of the other it requires a lot more research a lot more understanding and\nYes that dirty word compromise occasionally but if you're a Republican who hates all Democrats or a Democrat who hates are Republicans yours a problem\nAnd to brand one group\nBecause of an hour or a D. is the foolishness that his politics twenty Eighteen\n\nDoesn't mean I'm not going to advocate advocate for what I think is right and in my case that's generally conservative principles but I don't have to demonize other people I Will point out when they say things that make no sense\nThat's my job\nBut don't get started with the the labeling the it's not it's not Republicans is not Democrats who are are the problem everybody is the problem here\nWe're at where we're at because of bad behavior on both sides I'm trying to say All right we understand the anger how do we fix it a\nLot of smart people in this country doing a lot of smart things every day but in politics the cream is not rising to the crop folks\n\nLeaders are rare leadership is hard it shouldn't have to be that way you look at the private sector a long list of incredible leadership and leaders\nWhat is it about politics that flip the switch on on brain activity\nThat makes smart people dumb\nI don't expect to solve the world's problems but I at least expect a civil conversation about how to try to solve the world's problems and frankly we're not getting that she can be angry on social media you can flip out at at your friends who have a different political opinion than you do\nThat's not going to help anything\nIt's a collective issue not an individual issue individuality is selfish and\nNot very productive when it comes to solving the countries are the world's problems

yesterday they were open for business interesting development and that's actually a smart political play they they've moved their day off in that city named after Christopher Columbus Italian explore who a\nMarked the arrival\nThe ... in the Americas at the time on October ...\nAnd as we know from following our culture and our country lately um the storyline of the creation of our country the storyline of whites or European\nExplorers is not a popular one anymore for a lot of different reasons which I don't have time to go into but the interesting twist on the decision by Columbus ohio to not celebrate\nColumbus Day they have switched that day off for their employees and the closure of their city offices to Veterans Day which falls on November twelfth this year\nSo I'm thinking about this as an Italian American Columbus Day I Know that in in many places in New Jersey New York other places that still big holiday I think\nIt's Wednesday night by Thursday despite mostly sunny these guys were talking about high is only in the upper forties and friday morning we started out frosty will see mostly sunny skies through the afternoon but high temperatures only around forty seven degrees\nThat sunshine sticks around in the weekend on Saturday with Hi Simone fifties comedy religiously until the storm team forecast on WGM Jay who their record pressure is falling Lake Michigan

make a mistake sometime right [noise]\nSo my wife and I went to Europe or August August Eighth through the Eighteenth I Believe called don't August night August ninth through the tape we got back\n[noise] by genes Uri Jeff views radio WGM Jay CNN [noise] millennials have\nBeen dissected and I mean that's a side only just about any way that you can there just tend to be one of the quirky is generations on them boomers we're exam and we were looked at every which way but ... says well\nOr were they over pampered the millennials helicopter parents are they hypersensitive to criticism all of that has been examined now\nAs of officially come of age and there were a couple of different metrics but generally Nineteen eighty one to Nineteen Ninety five is what we consider millennials\nCNN has a piece pointing out when you look at what's going to happen in the next year or two they are expected to become quite frankly by attrition as there are fewer and fewer boomers they're going to be the largest by percentage generation and percentage a population of America yeah\nThey are not big time politically active and they measure that on two fronts one is that a lot of them seeking public office that your first thought might be while they're still kind of young yes but maybe not as young as you think Nineteen eighty one hard to believe for those of us were adults back then\nBut that is thirty seven years ago the oldest are technically old enough to run for president\nA big batch of them are old enough to run for Senate and house state and so on not saying it isn't happening but CNN's point there's it's not\nHappening as much as one might imagine given the salt that they have by virtue of their numbers and the poster person for this if you will is Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nA Kennedy U.S House of representatives she's the face of this the a very strong it would appear socialist agenda\nAs she puts it I'm going to make some Democrats mad if they're trying to deliver pay days for Wall Street donors but that doesn't mean I'm going to burn the house down CNN's point is there not a lot of her\nFor the really just aren't a lot of millennials stepping into the political fray can be any number of reasons for that I Want to throw a couple of things out and then I Want to get your thoughts on this\n[noise] the obvious reason I think it's just that would transcend generations is look at the blood sport that politics is today it has always been that but just it's been as spinal tap would say turns out to eleven\nHis dishes you saw that in the last couple of weeks right but I mean even beyond that so that's one\nI have to be careful here I don't want to\nOver generalize\nAs a generation\nThey're also not paying close attention\nThey ... and again this is a generalization and I accept an MIT that\nAnd I I'm sure that we'll get some millennials guy could not me no I don't I Know\nBut to speak of a generation you do have to generalize a

hear on the show as we talk rivers baseball up to the bottom of the hour we'll take your thoughts as well as for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the second mortgage talk and tax blind little housekeeping first we know the game times four games one and two of the you know the as friday night will be seven or nine the first pitch\nSaturday will be three oh nine the first pitch\nSo just one game to be played on friday the brewers and Dodgers will have the spotlight all odds of the baseball world will be on Milwaukee and then on Saturday when you start to mix in a another game so I think it's a three oh nine ... first pitch start and then it's off the Los Angeles for games three and four and maybe five who knows\nAnd put things on because he is Janson well he just swings to repeal Jansen Perot's from from its back you know from from what field\nAnd for whatever reason things have had good luck yes now that's a pitch any role in terms of bringing on another picture I guess like Davies I'm not old but this year I'm Anderson because he struggled but these has he's he's been very good at locating picture\nThat's going to be the key so if you had to move some guys out an off the roster and I'm sure people are like I'm not saying that bring in the same time but the point is he's done well again Johnson so you have to look at it from a matchup standpoint at this point in time\nSo you would ask you would add Davies right I Would add to that same okay if you're going to take Roxanne off you have to take another player off\nCorrect and if I had to take off one warped foyer I Would go into the boat\nI you have to take off\n... ... you know when he started wardrobe the other day it was outstanding um and when you look down in that bullpen I'm walking down the book and who want to you it's great\nAnd they're both uh Freddy Peralta was the only one I think correct so you cut friday prof it will go out and reach out here in New York and why it was ... hours as well\nYeah but you can tell if it's going to be one of your start you have to have you here or Peralta unfortunately can only have to picture and he just broke the primarily throw the Seventy seven percent of the time the Dodgers are too good hitters to have him on that roster this point in time or the announced yes that's just my opinion\nOkay for the phone call Ken I I think eleven pitchers in a seven game series I think is dangerous I think you have to have you have a least one more if not to\nUh you can't do that that Davies him take off for all your back at eleven and it's like you have to find another guy which I guess brings me to the larger point I don't think there's room for Roxanne or fans\nI I I really don't think there is the doctors will start a couple of left easier things would not be used on defense\nHis Jensen well okay but was awful as a pinch hitter during the season and I don't think Spain's finds a way under this roster at all or before we get to back to our calls and everything else in the program that I could a positive or to bury Nelson if it doesn't\nMake any sense All right Greg from the WTO O.
