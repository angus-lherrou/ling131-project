{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "It's already size so your take on the Murkowski a no vote at this stage of is I I Can't imagine she would shift in her in the voting for the full Senate tomorrow\n[noise] yeah we actually do have some some intriguing drama here it it it was interesting too if you were listening to the role mansion I think was the last\n... snuck is a ... vote in there right at the end you know I'm so it was it was up in the air there\nThat it's really interesting this was always kind of come down to these four they can't Hulu they can't lose too and it looks like they May of last one is kind of hard to imagine that someone would vote no on cloture and then yes on the nomination but I guess it's possible\nIt's also possible that some some of them are like Susan Collins is I guess it's going to announce her vote this afternoon\nI could vote yes on culture and vote no on the nomination so odd things are things are tight we knew it was going to be tight uh this'll this'll add some intriguing drama to the next twenty four hours\nTone Ross joining me from the Wisconsin institutes for long liberty you mentioned it earlier the impact on the upcoming elections or it could go a couple of ways we've seen for most of the summer and so they're really small democratic enthusiasm rising now in the last couple of weeks Republican enthusiasm has been rising to match that\nWhat what do we take away from if Kavanaugh is confirmed what that means for November [noise]\nYeah that that the the ... event for the last couple of weeks\nUm they they are consequential but they feel consequential this was kind of a watershed moment I don't know if you saw some of the TV ratings for those hearings a couple of weeks ago they were huge and I was I wondered how this was going to play where people really going to tune into this or were they not and and it was huge and I think\nAgain I think a lot of people who had made up their minds were just had their minds made up further a boat it's going to be really really interesting to see how this\nUh this fight trickles down um I I think I think both sides are going to come out of this I'm mad and in the news and it's really going to be um if if the Republicans needed a jumpstart I think this was it\nBut as we know I mean I think back just a month or so to the things that we thought were consequential items ... op ed in the New York times by supposedly a senior level official I mean what we know right now is that\nThat things that feel relevant and important in a moment a seemingly rarely stay that way so I think\nThirty some odd days seems like an eternity in this new cycle and political culture\nIt's kind of amazing that uh the Mueller investigation of slipped quietly in the background and I was gonna ask you a little bit later but I'll ask you know we're we're what what happened to that story line and this thing has been engulfed by the cabinet nomination\nIt absolutely has in and there were rumblings over the summer that there is going to be some type of\nA report from Mahler that maybe this will be wrapped up in September obviously that has come and gone my guess is that nothing is likely going to happen or before the midterms\nAre but that's a whole 'nother dynamic that hasn't gone away there was this giant New York times story on President Trump and how we inherited wet his wealth and questions about taxes or not maybe people don't care about that but I bet you have Democrats take the house of representatives they're going to care there's going to be committee hearings and investigations\nAs so there's a lot of things occurring or that have been overshadowed by this this fight that are just going to be there right after the elections that are going to be there and the months and weeks ahead\nTone Rob joining me as he will every Friday nine thirty five and take a quick break again after we get back I Want to have you gauge the Wisconsin racing governor us sending first congressional district toner up joining me on this Friday origins of beauty engine\nMostly on this Friday going to see more minutes with common Ross the final votes for some ... to move to the full Senate tomorrow fifty one forty nine\nWas Murkowski kind of a surprise nobles tone I Want to ask you quickly\nAbout the races in Wisconsin what impact these might have but really just gauge to save the races and start with the governor's race Uber's Walker [noise]\nYeah I mean the governor has been down he'll tell you it's been down he's been saying that and trying to get every ah get his side riled up um get their side engaged and maybe this these hearings is enough to kind of get Republican voters engaged but he's got his own message\nI he's got his message that has to do with Wisconsin that doesn't have to do with Washington DC and it it's it's a record to run out and it's something that I think he should be proud of and it was proud of we have these amazing economic numbers\nOf people start to take that stuff for granted we've seen this in the past and uh it's interesting to see I think in the last two weeks or so you've seen a little bit of a change in his messaging because it\nWould appear that his his messaging after the a Democrat primary didn't really work that much is number one down and Tony ... went up so you're starting to see a message about taxes about the economy\nThis kind of message of we can't afford Tony ... it'll be very interesting come Wednesday when we get a mark ... to see if that started to change the dynamic along with some of these other environmental factors like the cabin on hearing\nAnd US Senate booth near Tammy Baldwin a book fairs hip Gemini balls and hard us centered semi Baldwin on health care and those with some of the center scandal what's semi balls and scripted I ... if there is any\nBoy if it's been difficult it's been tough sledding I'm Tammy Baldwin it's always kind of had a she's had a lead\n... going back a long time and um it it's hard to say she seems to be in a in a different place where ah many of us thought that the ... scandal would be an effective indictment ineffective add there's this\nScandal's been around since twenty Thirteen I think Republicans are probably had four or five years to perfect the messaging on that but I actually thought team evolving to add\nThat featured this the the widow or the man who died in the ... was a pretty effective counter\nAnd so I think I think Republicans have to find a way to to show that this that this racist winnable\nAnd I think they got a track from national money they have to attract some national attention right now the traits of not on a lot of people's radars and that they're going to have to ... to get people excited that maybe this Kavanaugh thing is enough to get people excited it again I think this is one of the bigger things to the and the polls coming out\nAnd the last last we've got about a minute left the first in retinal district race against Ryan styles is this race\nI think so and it and it is because of the environment um otherwise I think Brian style would be walking away with this but I think just because of this is a tough environment\nUm I'll be I'll be very interested to see um it it it will be very interesting to see how how this race closes what what the attacks are going to be I mean Bryce have such a record been arrested nine times as in many ways you and I have talked about their fish kind of know he has no business being a congressman buck\nOr that race that district is a close one and the environment of favors Democrats that's going to be really really interesting\nTown rocket joined me every Friday nine thirty five good to talk to you have a good weekend great toner off from the Wisconsin you super long liberty there's plenty to talk about will continue to ah give you the latest on the cabinet as it moves forward to a final vote maybe as soon as tomorrow couple of surprises in the voting but\nThat vote is not the same as they find a confirmation vote which will happen maybe as soon as tomorrow the news is next regimen to be the engine\nMorning Wisconsin's channel nine he's really with you on this Friday Happy Friday everybody\nWe made it through the week if you're a Monday to friday workers fifty one degrees most of the rain has moved up here from my meteorologist friends at GM's you for the mores coming so are you ready for that I heard yeah just the rich or\nThe other day when I was watching her newscaster weather just and this is something people forget if it's raining and your windshield wipers Ron Turner headlight science the law not understand why people aren't doing that I Know a lot of the new vehicles are automatically do there for you but during those headlines it makes it safer no wonder we have so many crashes keeping all those lawyers\nImpound busy ten o'clock are always these foreign at ten the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee state in the world for a lot to talk about\n... lesser stories not they're not important to the fire department employee causing some controversy in Milwaukee I'll tell you that story at ten twenty three presidents goes to Minnesota\nNot a bastion of conservatives in by any stretch puts a well you bring a little bit of audio from what you said last night as he rallied the conservative troops in Minnesota how that plays into the other story will tell you in this for ten is Brett Kavanaugh nomination\nHow they'll vote today once who said yes or no that's coming out a little bit but we start with the Milwaukee Brewers temp sending this happened\nWhen you run a third [noise]\n\nHi drama or we have the uh the bullpen\nPlayoff game for the Milwaukee Brewers are and it worked perfectly until ... when they gave him a couple of runs the tides and thankfully they shut it down and and took it to the extra innings ... take away from the game one Christian college to run Homer\nThat guy just delivers every game\nIf there's anybody that's out there it will be fun to see the MVP votes when it's done\nAnd there's always happens there's always one or two knuckleheads people who decided to vote for some of them that shouldn't get it how could you not vote for Christian yellowish\nPublic safety professionals as much as you can publicly supported him because I think they have with that one of the toughest jobs in the planets\nAnd frankly to disrespect them to some people not I'm not everyone but some people show to them is unwarranted but this story bothered me so I wanted to sticking it to the fourth time a former Milwaukee firefighter ... coal craft he was going to be Mayor Tom Barrett ... latest deployment to the city fire and police commission well\nSome digging was done on average coal cross and some emails came up in one of these went after police\nAnd this was obtained by the journal center will be open records which is a good thing\nHe labels Milwaukee police I'm reading from the journal sentinel article by Dan buys a poorly trained force of who abuses overtime are more interested in their wallets pension benefits and protecting the public in costs of city millions on lawsuits over excessive force sexual abuse and killing people those are the words of every coal crop in an email obtained by the journal sentinel\nAlderman bookmark Murkowski would share vice chair of the public safety safety and health committee and was scheduled to vote on coal cross nomination said he was blown away by\nAnd I think they postponed the vote I'm I have to get clarification on that but let me say this those are disqualifying comments ... you're going to be tasked with overseeing the leadership of the marking fire police departments\nThis kind of information this kind of vitriol directed at another group of public safety professionals suggests to me you're not ready for this job suggested that you bring with your application to this commission a bias that suggests you can't look at things objectively\nNow mayors pick these people based on their history and their experience and that's all great and you are if he was a former firefighter and that part's fine but when you read those kinds of comments to suggest that something is not right here\nYou must make sure that anyone on the fire and police commission can look at things objectively using their experience to understand what what makes the most sense for these departments to make us safer to run officially and\nTo move forward with out a lot of nonsense this as drama and nonsense to something that frankly doesn't need it doesn't need any more drama and nonsense and I would reject that nomination immediately be based on those comments\nHe wrote him I don't think he's denying them firefighter or nuts going after\nThe other big department police department suggested me you're not ready to do the job for which you were appointed\nThat summer three of our forests and the four biggest stars as we see across Milwaukee to state in the real number for the president in ... Minnesota last night\nOn the play some of that a rally the audio he also mentioned is Brett Kavanaugh and a little bit later in the ah ten o'clock hour on TALK about this new high rise proposal in Milwaukee interesting project I'm based on what it's how it's going to be constructed what it's made of at least the inside\nAnd a white could be something that breaks some really new ground in our city and then don't forget friday for him to different people from two different walks of life\nToday Corey Peterson\nTracey Johnston two very smart women were talking about all the current events of this week cabin on the elections mid term elections coming up some of the other thing swirling in our news cycle that's all coming up with him on the clock or or as we do every Friday night at the end of the show before we had it off the Jeff Wagner who's at Miller Park\nA little bit of a fun from yesterday's game one of the un held yes\nLike Milwaukee's way now you'll leave she hopes the Rockies back to Colorado down the hall of famer Bob ... is on the call once again and our coverage starts to forty this afternoon Jeff Wagner is live at Miller Park or will be live\nBeginning at noon and night hearing WGM lots of excitement the festivities game to walk it jumps out in early one old leading the LDS I Will be out at Miller Park after the show today\nTo say Hi to some folks out there catch a little bit of that game a lots of drama man baseball playoff baseball's regular season baseball it is a tense\nCan be exciting can be a nerve wracking we saw that in game one yesterday I'm unwrap the forests hand with the story yesterday from yesterday president wasn't Minnesota rallying the base and he talked about the national story playing out in Washington DC today\nDo anything to hurt anyone to get the power\nThey so desperately grain [noise]\nOh no you know what the words are they wanna read they wonder what they want to LA demolish they want to destroy that's [noise] that's what I just take a look at what's going on Democrats [noise]\nHappening trying\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that was a rally in Rochester that you know Minnesota's pretty a traditionally democratic state was that was in Rochester an area that when heavy for president Donald Trump in the twenty sixteen election so he felt safe there\nI'm the president had a mixed week if you remember in Mississippi rally I think was on Tuesday nights he went after to some degree Christine Blasey Ford's testimony and go out to hurry when after testimony in and\nTo be honest I Would have left it alone but what the essence the none of what he was saying is true her evidence or lack of evidence her testimony has not been supportive and there's a lot of interesting tidbits or side stories related to that one of them is\nThat uh we win Kaiser her friend someone\nShe said was that the party who has been pretty adamant that she doesn't remember like Christine Blasey Ford remembers it well apparently she was approached by a former FBI PR person\nTo tweak her story and that's\nRaising a lot of eyebrows and actually even from some liberal journalists\nIcon liberal journals they call themselves journalists I'm suggesting that something doesn't seem right there that the connection between the attempt to kind of fudge the story of legal in ... to make Christine Blasey Ford's story more believable so that's another Side Story of this uh\nThis high drama playing out in Washington DC I mentioned earlier with the cabinet nomination ah fifty one forty nine and a procedural vote today now moving to the full Senate tomorrow for the final vote on for a cabinet\nAnd here we are Lisa Murkowski was a no senator from Alaska on the procedural votes\nI Would assume then again you never really know what they should be no on the final confirmation votes Senator Susan Collins was a yes on the procedural votes I assume again you never really know she'll be yes tomorrow slate was Senator Flake was it yes\nJoe Manchin the only Democrat from West Virginia very conservative state he was also yesterday\nAnd as far as Tammy Baldwin\n[noise]\nAnd of course we all knew she said no before she ever even ... she was in the Chuck Schumer campus like yeah we we heard just say his name but we're still going to go no and or frankly I said this last week after the requests for the FBI the seventh FBI background check and Brett Kavanaugh\nNone of these Democrats were going to change their mind and that was a show that was a pageant a beauty pageant if you want to use that terminology for future candidates for president the Cory bookers to come out with Harris and Kamala Harris\nI'm going to play some of this and the friday forum for my two guests because she has some comments on this process and I want to get their reaction to coming up a little bit later but\nThe president is going to continue to have these rallies across the country really echoing the twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen ramp up\nTo twenty sixteen election is what he does best he goes off the cuff gets himself in trouble as I said it was ... Mississippi comments not helpful\nAnd when you're in the business of getting votes moving votes to your side those comments did not help they might make the base feel better about that\nWe need senators to vote yes in that speech on Tuesday night in Mississippi may have\nTaken a boat or two away but we won't know until tomorrow when the full Senate votes on the final confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh after the break is a new high rise going up up in Milwaukee and it's it's rather unique so I wanted to bring it to you or its construction could be\nSomething we haven't seen ever before on this planet be happening right here in Milwaukee so let's say that story next regime to be the engine\nGames in a hall of fame or five years ... is on the call once again and I covered\nIt's again and our coverage starts to forty this afternoon actually bump you're just going to join Jeff Wagner shortly after his show kicks off at Miller Park right after the noon hour and I'll be out at Miller Park this afternoon after my show as well taking in soaking in\nActually literally soaking in if I have a beer um the er the atmosphere of game chew at Miller Park as the brewers Rockies commence to playing some baseball little after three o'clock this afternoon even hearing All right here on WGM due to the bottom you could just living broadcast [noise] uh\nThis story interesting and a lot of different ways [noise] um there's there's ... ... if you if you're in Milwaukee and work in Milwaukee you live in Milwaukee you've seen the incredible\nMy fair share my times\nBut there were a lot of people freaking out last night about Jeremy jumper what's going on with them he wasn't available in Chicago you didn't look good this guy can't be the closer we had somebody call and say Jeremy Jeffress doesn't have the confidence to be the brewers closer\nAnd my message to you last night was it's going to be fine it's all going to be fine you know you have a relief pitcher who was an all star who's been closing at an all star caliber for the better part\nOf the last what two three months some balls got through yesterday maybe as our speed and stuff wasn't working quite as much\nBut I no doubt that he was going to be fine and you know what I think I don't think ... council did this on purpose but I think it kind of turned into a stick it up to you know what to the people out there that are dowdy J. J. because not only does he bring Jeremy ... back\nThe day after he blew the said yesterday he gives them two innings he had an opportunity not give them two innings\n... done everything in his power to make sure that pitchers have not hit in this series and the first two games and he allowed Jeremy Jeffers to hit for himself in the eighth inning\nThat's if you have any doubts about Jeremy ... quite honestly\nI don't know what you're watching I I he every picture is human he was human yesterday had some bad luck yesterday he was dominant tonight and that's the German shepherd is that we certainly expect to see for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one six twenty\nTo act that mortgage talk intact sign will take your phone calls it takes ... we'll take your tweets\nOff I mentioned a great mass of conduct Russell we also hope to hear from my practice Sean just while you may hear from Jerry Augustine we got a lot of people to hear from 'em and we'll hear from a correct council his post game a segment our post game conversation is coming up in just a while and we will go through the game with the highlights as well we'll get some sub prime time zone that\nAs we go along through the evening but right now\nA lot of moving parts is this game has been over for just a little while let's jump into the phones we've got to Ryan who is still at Miller Park I assume outside in the parking lots Hey Ryan thanks for calling your on WGM Jay\nThank you for taking the call I'm stuck in the parking lot man what a game to be at a go brewers I'm curious to know if you guys have any thoughts about how they're going to pitch game three of them might start yoga dollars maybe doing other ball game or just curious to know a ... on that particular\nYou bet I believe it's going to be weighed Miley and the post game notes that we were just handed it list weighed Miley is the starter for game number three that make sense to me because yesterday weighed Miley was in the dugout\nAnd ... was in the bullpen at one point or geo got up and started throwing and there were some people I got a text message from somebody yesterday saying that they thought that was kind of\nDisrespectful to Wade Miley when ... started throwing and I couldn't have been you know even\nAny further away from that thought process when I started yoga dollars warming yesterday I said okay that means weighed Miley and all like this is going to start getting three and what are you know waiting Miley is listed as the game three starter will go back to the phones we've got Bruce was out in the parking lot at Miller Park ... British here on WGM Jay\nHey how you doing things for I Am good oh you bet\nListen you know and like I was telling you earlier you know we we listen to the post game show last night and you know I think Germany Jeffers got all you got thrown under the bus and I you know\nHe had a great year and then you know he comes out tonight and he goes you went you know more than one in you know\nHe just he was on his game tonight and I\nThink you know we need to give Jeremy ... is a little bit older than I as I said I just want your thoughts on that are about thanks for taking the call\nGo bad and ah there was\nI was I was on an island last night I felt like Jeremy ... I've been talking to people today a little bit about yesterday show because I'll be honest with you I come into this boots and I do the show and I've been doing this for three years and I've got a pretty good idea of callers and and the sort of things are going to be talked about I see things on social media\nI was astonished by the fan reaction to yesterday's gave you would have thought the brewers lost that game I mean I was a little disappointed I was I walked out of Miller Park yesterday a little bit disappointed and\nHow much negative stuff was coming across and Jeremy Jeffress\nAbsolutely deserved to come in and pitch the ninth today who cares that he gave up a couple of runs yesterday every picture it's human it happens no reason to uh to jump off any kind of train just because he gave up a couple of runs yesterday so I I agree\nBruce I I absolutely agree with what you just said and he absolutely does deserve a a lot of love for what he was able to do that you look good especially in that second any man he looked really really good Brian in east Troy Hi Brian you're on WGM Jay\nHow's it going what a great thing for the study of more I was at the game last night with my friend Mike was very fortunate to go to the stadium was electric the crowd was nuts so that it was in my I was at all that I wasn't looking up at the end of this night but that was my six year old son\nAnd we're in our driveway at home and my neighbors must have\nThought I was nuts were yelling how exciting\nFor the St ... I was nine years old when the brewers went to the world series back in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd this is just bringing everything back so laid back then I Can't believe how exciting it was just for sitting on the other is near the last night with Jeffrey's you came back Tonight Show everybody off did a great job and what a great win for the Milwaukee Brewers\nAppreciate the phone call and I think there's a lot of people that are kind of putting themselves back into younger years in previous brewer sees as a guy that I get into it a little bit sometimes via the text line up Mike in Milwaukee\nHe he's an older guy who doesn't always liked the or the way baseball changes the bullpen games in the short a appearances for pictures and things like that and I love this tax message that we got from Mike all I can say is go through I Am beside myself with joy\nOr you might know in baseball crazy but this old man is in heaven and he says things have come up with me for all of the year I uh I Know I've tested you and says one more thing crowd was magnificent crew was magnificent as well brewers are doing things differently and when you see things that are different I think as a\nAs this is a human quality sometimes not so much a sports fan quality sometimes when you see or experience things differently than you normally do your first reaction is to kind of turn away from it and the brewers are doing things differently and it's really working\nAnd they've got the analytical data to back up what they're doing\nAnd then most importantly the players are coming through you know one of my frustration the times during the course of the season\nIs correct council will make a move by the numbers makes all the sense in the world\nAnd it doesn't work because the player doesn't execute ... council player to execute it happens or human I'm not mad at the guy for not executing\nIt's going to happen last night German shepherds to not completely execute both rivers doing right now is uh it's pretty impressive to see how they've been able to win all these games and it's a they're fun team to Las Vegas man they got some swag right now\nThey got some slack as they come out and play on an everyday basis Michael is in Brookfield hey Michael you're on WGM Jay\nThank you for taking my call you know I just got a few things about the spark up\nA ... uh for one thing the guy's a junior he is he's really a junior a you know no one should really question I'm here to start a crew he believes in his fulltime he believes in the ... the ball players believe in themselves\nUm it's it's the way it is when you have a closer like Jay Jay you just continue to go and bring them in and and closing situation because he is a closer I'm just making great call she believes in little tiny he's been doing it all season long\nPlayers believing on shows and I tell you what now we go find them can go five hundred ball or in the world series and you know what I was at that game yesterday and I was a cow game with a bunch of mice\nIt's my friend's atmosphere was fantastic huge violence and um I was inside the ballpark of electric it was ... it was great the crowd was on an unbelievable\nAnd those players really respond to the energy that the fans get I'm I'm I they just seem to amaze me I'm telling you is there something very very special about to happen to the city of Milwaukee I really mean I really believe that and I'll tell you two words let's go now\nI I ... I like it I appreciate the phone call to the point that you hit on I think I think there is this\nWeird maybe we're wrong word but go with that I Do think there's kind of a weird connection that ... the yeah there's a wall between fans and players obviously you're not going to their house for dinner tonight I get that but there does seem to be [noise]\nCope with setting aside don't even know if that's the word but that's what I'm going to as it does seem like\nThe the players beat up the fans of the fans speed up the players here the finger thing with the show us some law like the fact that the players\nHave gotten to the fans all involved with that it is a really really cool thing\nAnd it is absolutely found that to be around for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one six twenty it's the accident mortgage talk a declaration you could tweet in as well at math Pauli on air we'll get to as many Cokes as we can we continue on with our brewers extra ... edition to a more phone calls we're set to be joined by Travis Shaw\nI'm Roy and I support ... for the Senate because I witnessed his leadership while serving with him in the United States Army thinks they'll [noise]\nI'm not an expert Gail plane got their state Senate because he's a CPA and a leader on ...\nStay down I'm Bill Cohen going for discussion\nPaid for by ...

PGA thanks for holding your on WGM jak\nYeah there's a lot of fodder to discuss here just listen to all the feedback from a call or is it from the experts but it comes down to a couple of things you know we've got some aggressive based writers they make mistakes over the last couple of games but like you point out it it will cost us anything and I just you know I got to say that\nCouncils pitching is Asians had been rectified you know I I was at both ... there were a lot of people in the in the crowd last night were upset\nGet upset when you win and then tonight a worst Jeffers coming on\nAnd get your joining the way he did\nJust rectifies decision I tell you what the crowd was electric when Jefferson came out to the case for himself\nAfter we put up at three spot knowing that he'd come back out there I I just said well we'll just justifies every way he's been mentioned the editors ... makes you feel good\nThat's all I guess I appreciate the phone call\nGreg in if we can happen the delorean and go down a different path ... would have been kind of funny and I think this would have happened let's say he would have gone away from Jeff first you know when something happened and then brought in Guerra broaden per author or something and all of a sudden\nThe or maybe the tourists score tied or something everybody would be calling today saying why did you live Jefferson yesterday everybody was calling and saying why did you put ... percent it's just it's it's funny sometimes um\nYou why would people complain about pitching decision made by Craig council unless you've got all the analytics and all the numbers right in front of you to tell them tell me or tell somebody else would have better decision would be your you're wasting your time\nAnd the story of the series so far it's been the brewers pitching to runs in Nineteen ... to a Colorado ... that I think it's got a lot of explosive firepower now admittedly some of these guys are better at Colorado Lottery numbers are better in Colorado that on the road but nonetheless the they're confused\nGuidelines for every story we're a little hitters just look off at the plate\nAnd that's a great situation to be and so instead of seeing a reliever come into work Colorado can say All right we've had this guy before we can get them again now it's it's the brewers pitching coming in saying yeah I've I've been through this guy before I've been through this suck it all lined up before and I was ever a ton of confidence right now and\nIt tonight the ability to attack on a few runs I think late was also critical it just it it allows you to relax a little bit I think as a fan and and certainly as a manager and get some wiggle room and that might thinning you did last night as well but it was eaten up by an ad on runs while you didn't need them tonight sure make everyone feel a lot better\nTo go to Tyler and west Ben hey Tyler you're on WGM Jay\nEgg good to talk to you guys um I I I like are on

that's [laughter] that's a long time that's a pretty impressive\nOr they record it their second ever shut out um it's Iowa last where I was reading from the record their second never shut out in the postseason they also had a shutout in game one of the Nineteen eighty two World Series at St Louis that was a tenant nothing victory\nOr they had fourteen shut out over the course of the regular season\nAnd that was a pretty good number of the most that they've had since at twenty Thirteen\nMike ... says it safely and each of his last eight ... postseason games that goes back to a game six of

back and enjoy himself tonight not the theme of accomplished anything yet you don't celebrate until you have the series and they are still won when away from getting the series well let's just think about ... seconds let's put everything\nReally in perspective here's a guy who was unheralded when he was signed by the brewers\nEven as he has put together this really special season quite honestly there are still hasn't been a lot of talk about what shot seen has been able to do he came up in the rocky system actually when I worked in the rocky system a triple A. I. broadcast to a number of his games at that point\nHe came up in the rocky system he's never pitched on short rest and he does that tonight and he comes up with the with the performance of he came up with just battling and that's pretty special this is going to be one of those games I promise you\nHe is going to remember for the rest of his life our game three is coming up on a Sunday eight three thirty seven first pitch we are going to have it here on WGM Jay the Packers are going to be over a Ninety four five FM Katie Hi country\nSo you'll be able to hear the brewers are right here with our upbringing coverage beginning at about three thirty weighed Miley is listed as the scheduled start or for the brewers are Amman Marquez is listed the scheduled start for the Rockies I don't believe that\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a credit freeze question for me\nI knew I took care of five to help protect from identity theft and for my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card and before I started to fall my code I wondered if if I just need to fall\nUm just for one credit ain't a favorite or do I need to solve all three\nThis is a frustration of mind because you should only have to thaw want\nAnd generally\nWhen a financial institution is pulling a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they tap into one\nAnd I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever\nI have never\nEver been able to get someone at customer service to tell me what bureau they draw from and which one that I Need to thaw\nAnd so I've had to thaw all three when I open and account for somewhere where they want to pull your credit or done an application for credit and that's\nThat's silly but I just want to ask you first so I think it's worth I think it's worth you though Larry giving a call to the credit card company isn't one of the big issue worse yes do you happen to have a card with one of them right now I Do not\nBecause many times you have access to a some equivalent of your credit score now\nFor credit cards that you have and they'll tell you you know this is based on your Equifax reporter Experian or trans union they'll tell you which one and then you know who that bank or have a pretty good idea who that bank is going to draw\nA report from for credit out\nBut without that kind of source information\nIf no one can tell you when you call in you know 'cause sometimes hell of a number you can call in to apply for a cart over the phone there'll be separate than their regular\nCustomer know service call a number and you might have a better chance with one of those people who might well no which bureau\nThey pull from and give us some pause and then you'd be able to thaw it just that one\n... knowing that I'm Better protected from identity remind credit for is a\nGood choice to do that and if you want to know how to do it yourself if you go to Clark dot com go read our credit freeze guide and just minutes you can lock down your credit from a criminal who might decide to pretend they're you an open credited counts as if they argue\nMurray is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Marie\nHow ... how are you doing\nWell some some for John and I come across a company that well shoot the links among legitimate way to make some money\nPosts links so you would go on like Facebook or something and you post links to something that supposedly would generate revenue for them\nTo get paid for it yes\nAnd how what do you have to do to get involved and how do you get paid\nI don't care how can I own computer and lace unchecked face on the number links and I I\nHave never heard of that I that's why I was asking you what you have to do so you don't have to pay anybody any money\nYes that's correct [noise] no no\nAnd what kind of links are they having you post I mean what are they need you for what is it that you're doing that they couldn't do for themselves\nIdeas shift and demand that maybe it's my my time and enjoying it can they can get around today huh\nOkay so there there is a website that I'm looking at right now that says that that is completely bogus\nOkay and it was really odd company to it\nSo it's funny it says the article says fell explain exactly why making money posting links is complete and utter nonsense and why these Web sites only exists to rip people\nOff foreigners from what I thought\nSo if you want to read the full story and see what's behind it will give you the blank off the air if you'd like to read and see\nHow it plays out so\nThey don't have any information on you like your checking account or anything like that\nOh no I won't get anybody that over the phone or over the Internet now\nRight so have you ever put you on hold and just second and we'll give you the link to that but I also want to say to you the good news right now is there are millions of jobs begging for workers\nRight now across the country and even at my age [laughter]\nIt doesn't matter what age you are obviously issues Murray with with\nAge discrimination in employment in the country\nWhere there's no doubt that is true but at the same

to be taking that cash and putting it into a house that you two have together\nAnd it's a boyfriend girlfriend thing and not a husband and wife so I what makes me nervous is you put it into a joint asset this money that right now is completely yours\nCorrect so that so if you ask me um you can tell them getting nervous here for you to listen to you [laughter] because I Would\nI Would tell you that that makes me nervous for you if you look at the two of you is just a unit you stay a unit that's your whole\nDeal and you are going to sacrifice what you had from the sale of the proceeds of

is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you saw great how're you doing wonderful\nThank you you have a very generous relative what's going on\nUm yeah I've got a grandfather who over the years a as a Christmas gift contributed to my\nFive twenty nine planets um and now I'm at the point I'm a junior in college and uh but I'm also a full scholarship athletes at my university so I really needed to you this\nWhat do you do David\n...\nWow so do you know what talent I have that I could do on any athletic feel\nA lot of no\nThat's right because there isn't any [laughter] I'm impressed that you're good enough that you could get a a full ride athletic scholarship that's wonderful to hear thank you so um\nWhen there's a scholarship you're telling me that none of the five twenty nine money you had to use 'cause you're on a full free ride\nYes sir [noise] okay so your grand dad has some choice uh-huh [noise] first I should ask what are the odds that you're going to go to graduate school at some point after finishing undergraduate\n... chance um I'd say it's probably less likely but there's still a chance I Would pursue graduate school\nAnd the reason that's my question is that then it's it's easy you can't just sit there and then when you were to enroll in graduate school if you did then you're going to need to pull on the five twenty nine money and then you're able to you tax free\nRick cause you're a scholarship athlete there was a special provision in the five twenty nine rules that your grand dad can withdraw the money pay no ten percent penalty\nBut he would have to pay tax on all the earnings five twenty nine it's had\nOkay then it could be his money because the because actually the owner of the five twenty nine account for those without it it's their discretion what to do with money which comes to the next point are there any other grandkids who have yet to attend college\nYeah it's who have yet to attend college\n[noise] um yeah have a three more younger siblings\nSo the best move by your grandfather is to change the beneficiary designation to one of your younger siblings it maintains the tax free status\nAnd then the money can be used for your siblings college and you get the full benefits of the earnings that have occurred over the years being spent tax free on school\nOkay and so that would be in a case where you think grad school is not a big priority not likely moving the money to a younger sibling is the best\nSo the only thing you have to do then she just got to live on less than what you make and put the money in the fine and the four one K. or the Roth IRA\nRight let's say you're doing something where you're putting money aside and its money not for retirement necessarily it's money you may need and the next let's say I'm five to ten years I'll use that as a window\nThere's something you can buy that people in the investment community are always making fun of\nBut it works it's a very simple thing called a balance fun\nAnd most balance funds you just buy the one fund and it's really good for that period of time that's less than ultra long term investing more than ten years but longer than when your money should be in savings somewhere between five and ten years of balance fun\nAnd everybody sells him is generally sixty percent in stock type choices forty percent in bonds bonds or where you are lending money to people kind of like being in a bank lending money to them\nTo sixty percent stocks forty percent bond you just buy the one fund and you're set the reason that such a good choice for an investment window of five to ten years is that\nA balance fun doesn't go up as much as a pure ... fun in good years but it loses a whole lot less in bad years for the stock market and so when you move beyond the five year window\nYour odds of it performing overall well for you\nOver five six seven eight nine ten years is very good and again all you've got to know is he by the balance fun and hopefully you buy an ultra low cost one from one of my low cost providers just like with the\nStuff I talked about what the target retirement fund so those are the two easiest scenarios I Know now if you want to do more\nYou can get a little more complicated and use\nA handful of what a known as index funds that's where instead of picking specific socks you just buy parts of the market the u._s. stock market which was a fraud market index or total stock market index is something you can buy and then\nYou buy one that's an international fund\nAnd then maybe depending on your situation if you're a far from retirement you could stop with those two or if you're closer to retirement or the need for the money you could throw in a bond fund\nAnd have a mix of those three and you could call it a day if you're in a really high tax bracket the bond fund might be a tax free municipal bond fund high tax bracket would be people who are earning several hundred thousand dollars a year or more\nThe reason I point out these three examples or one find solution for retirement account or One Fund solution for an intermediate term tend to cycle of needing to put money aside and help it grows\nOr the third starting to add more funds more choices is that part of building an investment portfolio does not have to be complicated and it can be done with a minimum of effort at extremely low cost\nNo commissions up front extremely low expense is going on so I Know everybody in the industry wants you to feel like poor Ludo you you can't do anything for yourself\nAnd that is not true do not allow yourself to be intimidated if even having subtle that you're still like freaked out nine comfortable\nThere's an entire new area of service called robo invest it and that all save for another time Christian is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Kristen\nHow ... how are you great thank you your husband is working to get us rock solid credit record is that right\nWell he's got a long way to go but um she gathered that is exactly what we are trying to do\nThe long way to go what's the history\nHe went on a motorcycle accident I'm a little over several years ago and I think time he was uninsured ...\nHouses recovery Ben\nI'm like how he has been good I mean luckily he weighs on in his early mid twenties when the accident happened that he had you got hit by a ... that that does\nNot add up he ended up having to court clerk at home I'm\n... ... it was a domino effect rarely so now where we're doing better I mean as far as our financial scale he started a small howling company that he ... than I Am a hairstylist then\nI have excellent credit and we're really wanting to purchase a home you know how to play next year maybe sometime in the near future\nSo we get to know what the best routed to go to help clean up his credit you know the weekends solid ate his medical bell the we weren't quite that collection agencies I I guess I'm not sure what the best course of action at\nHow many years ago was the motorcycle accident\nBy accident south take place in February she thousand eleven and a and from what I can tell going through his record the ... things went into collection and she thousand twelve eighty thousand Thirteen\nSo the the items it actually goes from when the original debts were incurred but those debts stay with him for roughly two more years\nOkay they say in his life for seven years did anybody sue him and get a judgment against him for any of the medical deaths\nThat I'm aware of I haven't seen anything like that um I mean we do get notices from the collection agencies that I have not seen or heard anything about anyone feeling and\nSo the odds are probably likely that at this point he's outside of what some of the statute of limitations which means they are most states they wouldn't be able to sue him against any of those medical debt at this point\nBut as far as how they affect this credit with those outstanding collections on his credit truth is he can not qualify for mortgage right now\nLikely Fat Chance so we're going to talk options what are the odds that you with your great credit\nTo qualify for a mortgage you have enough income you can qualify for a mortgage for the price point house who are interested in\nLast year my problem with fairly loud here on earth and much better in the NFL after I found my taxes next year the and conquer this year will look good and have their favor\nBut I was pulled before when I looked in the past they they look at your last year that your your income tax 'em to determine what you qualify for\nThat depends on the winter okay and\nYou you are going to find that you're straight path to homeownership is going to be if you can qualify\nAs the lone borrower them hey\nBut let's talk about him because his credit score number do you know what it is right now\nI just talked yesterday and it was like at five thirty five\nThey and he's got to be in the six hundreds to be able to qualify even with the most lenient of lenders under the F ha loan program so the the\nThe foreclosures hanging there that's going to be there for seven years as a reflection on the credit\nFor seven years as a reflection on the credit but the medical bills are an interesting case because if he is able to pay the medical bills\nOr you reach a deal on those medical bills and then they report a zero balance under the newest of the credit scoring models to harm from those will disappear with the debts having been having gone from a balance to zero\nHow much in total war those medical bills that the collectors are after him for\nAt this point what I added up it's about four thousand which is a lot less than ... white he initially old and I don't know if that's because the collection agencies are settling for less\nThan the original ... pills that I thought it was over a hundred thousand a year now when I asked him about it it's about fifty four thousand um what's your show a lot of a lot of money um\nI just wonder how has start rebuilding has got it\nRight so if you want to help rebuild its a separate issue than the homeownership okay and that is for you to join their credit union if you've not done so already and a number of credit unions have something that goes on the generic term fresh start program\n... [laughter] actually that's not really flush the answer is I I\nMy own personal experience I have I have a\nI I can I can swear on my house was built in the spring that mine is constantly going off um there's also some some ah some neighborhoods regimes geologically some houses filter better than others and sometimes you can follow that like a straight line right through the neighborhood on whose whose works who's ... who's ... who doesn't\nLet me something walking shots it's it's kind of a um a mess\nSometimes just got to do with the sewer lines or where they are located near buried in gravel water flows through the gravel uh\nBut like I said grading the number one thing is check the grading on the outside you might have surfaced drainage grading gutters and bounce policies that just might cause more water to full towards your basement\nAnd try to correct it so that's number one number two is as long as the pumps running in your basement is not getting wet yeah it's doing its thing is to what it's supposed to do\nBut if it runs that much then I Would look at hiring a plumber and getting a heavy duty system installed they're probably involves two pumps an alternate back and forth maybe with a battery backup\nAnd you spend Fifteen hundred bucks or something I'm In and then you know the basement stays ... pumps are going to war maybe even two grand for something like that 'cause it probably takes a big crock I'm into otherwise you cross your fingers and just hope you pump doesn't fail because your base will fill up and said well\nThat's that's the next question is you know if you have a compass working regularly let's say do you replace it every other year every year\nWell they work they work their design for a hundred thousand cycles so\nDon't figure out how many times a day that's running and and I kind of game that we live about three weeks for you know the real answer ... is whatever you're comfortable with [noise]\nAh 'cause my my ... all the time and I replaced him every two years I I can I've I've gotten how many times if I said this if if you had four inches of water in your basement what would you pay them you know right right exactly yeah it's it's it's an insurance policy for your mind Howard Dean\nGood luck with that let us know what happens eight forty one we will take a break we will be back worked for one for seven nine nine one six twenty negative Morgan ... fix that show with Tom face it Eric Brown citing unlimited here as well this is Steve ...

suggestion that um\nIf you are in the ... bay area um the palace resorts are really good um do some Hilton Z roles hall Hilton\nOr um some of the ... properties are very nice so they're um you really can't go wrong I mean Jamaica is has so many choices and whether it's new grill or take away some of the like I said the palace and the bureau stars are also have some great choices\nOkay can I ask one other real quick question I'm sure I'm\nNow I'm thinking back many many years ago and how it was it why isn't necessarily leap year resorts\nUm what you say that that is something to be wary or do you think things are better I guess I don't know I don't know how to board\nThat right now I understand your question first of all I Want to say common sense kind of prevails um I wouldn't go walking off the property at night but during the day depending where you are for example if you are much equal pay some of the resorts are some of them are in walking distance to the town\nI'm into walk there during the day to the market says no problem\nBut don't arrive could relate\nTo that with me\nBut at night for sure I Would not yeah for sure you don't drive and hang on Saturday if you're in a taxi\nBut if you're taking any kind of a chore or anything I Would recommend organizing that through the resorts where they pick you up at the resort not to go off the site and just grab any tour person I Would definitely organize out through the resorts then you can you know you can trust that person\nOkay excellent [noise]\nAnd give us a call yeah yeah cool yeah thank you thank you for

years five years say is like ... years thirty five years you don't you work for six months straight without a day off so Linda\nIn Brookfield boy have you called in the right to Trisha is an expert of cruises what's up mourning\nMourning church that I have a question about ... years ago we went on a cruise and we had one evening they you know with all the beautiful dessert and things like that no one thing to\nDo that anymore at least not that I'm aware of and I'm just wondering if you read what would be kind of a luxury cruise lines that way you know how to do some of those things [noise]\nThank you for calling Linda you're right a lot of cruise lines have gotten away from those quote unquote\nOn average most cruise lines maybe just one of those a week I think they just found after you've eaten so much food at dinner and throughout the day that so much was they waste so it was beautiful work out and take their pictures of people they were just\nWrite that one I I tend to see you were one of those people [laughter] a lot of things right so they do\nI get most cruise lines I Would say have um maybe one of those a week and they'll kind of combine the sculptures with the ice or the butter or the fruit sculpture or always many what a lot of cruise lines have gotten into now is happening on more galley tours\nUm some are free something they do charge nominal fee and then if you get involved in those galley chores they will have a buffet and some sculpture set up in the dining room\nAnd so it's really yeah it's a little more exclusive and you know if you didn't actually looked into that you might not see it because it's let's say during the day so maybe that would be a lunch and that way there they can portraying show what they offer but people but also eat it because it's at lunchtime right\nRight which is fine when you say that you know when it's a little bit more like even if you know like ...\nMembers Tricia she's calling from Brookfield to come clear which way to live\nSo I Would say um there's like there's several choices out there wasn't that I have actually two of them and I've sailed on that are a little different from each other one is reject cruise lines there have you heard of them\nSo they they have a couple of different sites ships um a couple that are about six hundred passengers and they do have a few that are a little larger but they are all inclusive cruise light so literally your\nBeverages your chores and it is very upscale it is kind of country club sailing is what I Would say is limited ... do you like to dress for

would be a national tree\nI we've just been hearing a lot about it and people just felt like rats are just some place different\nYou know have you been to Alaska no no not yet because they use it for

large fan um but yeah\nThere is waterfall that is it just so breathtaking I mean I Would depending what you're interested in is um I Would probably recommend\nGoing like sick towards the summer solstice time of year end of June to like have the longer\nDaylight hours is right um I was there around that time I Believe it was early to mid July and just to have those longer daylight hours it is so breathtaking in its yeah you know not commercialized that they the people are so nice that is\nIt's just awesome area are you thinking of going next summer\nI'm if I'm right away falling yeah

whole foods talk a little bit of\nBoth the week that's coming up next we got an earnings season and starting again we had great earnings in the second or what do you expect to see for the third quarter as the S. and P. five hundred or any particular sectors of yes and the five hundred well the\nCurrent estimates are for about Nineteen percent earnings growth and king three following two twenty five percent of course our expectation is those estimates are probably too low the effect of of tax reform like corporate profitability\nStrengthen the economy to like so we're looking for another twenty percent quarter in terms of asking the earnings for one difference between this court and the prior to though is there are some companies issuing\nDownward guidance homebuilders as one example I mean just notice yesterday day that the home builder index is down Thirteen Days in a row that's never happened before and homebuilders are leading indicator so this is something we've got to watch our innings expectations for twenty Nineteen\nToo high right now we don't think they are but there is a possibility that if tariffs perk up or we get some uncertainty on on business confidence alike that some estimates might start to come down that would cause us it'd be more defensive\nAnd that naturally leads us to this conversation that's been happening which is peak earnings and explain to everybody what\nThat means peak earnings is the absolute high of earning so our investment team did some work going back to ... past market cycles and what we found is supplement\nTo an absolute peak in earnings for al earnings would continue to go up the growth rate it starts to slow said basically the second to rebut if turns negative but the ... year over year change remains positive\nAnd stocks tend to respond pretty well for quite some time so it sort of peak in absolute dollars or is it up is is it a peak in the growth rate it gets a peak and the growth\nRate so that's really interesting because companies are still making more money in that case which would continue to support the stock price continue to go higher even though the growth rate comes down\nWell and that goes back to what I said earlier about stock market's being discounting mechanisms because the stock market will look for a slow down an earnings that question is how much of a slow down and

on Dave spano and Marshalls wall on WGM Jay feedback dumb parks director retirement services antics off management ... welcome back thanks for having me when we talk a lot about four on caves with you that's that's your thing we also talked about financial\nStress because that's part of financial wellness and that's what we do here at antics wealth management as well\nFor sure and the two are very much linked together boy they are there's an emergency savings crisis in this country there's a lot of people but when they get hit with something of transmission goes you need new tires I mean you name it when there's a need for cash you don't want to be run or the payday loan store\nAnd people just don't have regular savings for that and we're going to talk about the cycle side car yeah it's interesting you sent me this article that side car plan that could soon be attached year for our own K. naturally I thought side car and I was taking cocktails federal shot in a beer right well you know that's how I look at it but there is actually a cocktail named the ride currents got at the sweet drink you know\nBut um that's a future segment that as we all do we need more time for that right so\nTalking about doing is giving people the ability to save a small amount of money for\nNon qualified so meaning it's not a tax advantage to count the reason they're talking about this in conjunction with retirement plans is retirement plans are already set up it's a natural compliment sure that industry people are already taking paycheck withdrawals for the ... facility for one case a lot of the mechanisms it'd be similar to protest\nThat like a tiny bucket but your fill up and if you have you did you take it\nRight yeah and you don't get a tax break down or anything like that but it's there to help you put some money aside to help save for an emergency and part of it is they're looking at the amount of loans that people take from four one K. is there like you said going to pay the loans trying to keep that from happening if you have a small emergency you need a washer dryer or something like that we don't want your rating four one K. for that\nEverybody talks about the emergency fund this is to build the emergency fund\nThat's right credential financial found that sixty nine percent of Americans have less than a thousand dollars in savings account you know so it could be something with the car to be an appliance you know things that you need to run your life on you can't just not drive your car to work if it's not working you got to fix that what they're looking at is how can we figure out a way\nTo give people a little stash over here that will help them with those emergencies\nThe figure I read was was like twelve million payday loans for the fees on those things nine billion dollars\nYeah um I Do some financial literacy education outside of work and that is the one thing I tell the kids 'cause it's to high school kids say whatever you do stay away from the pay the loans the interest it's like one of those things in hotel California once you get into one of those things are really hard to get out and it is expensive\nNot having the money to pay these emergency needs there's your financial stress\nRight and that's why this all ties into financial wellness and when we talk to people\nIn the retirement plan industry so often the conversation was you need to save more and people would say I can't afford to the natural reaction and people in our industry will be well you can't afford not to and you go back and forth no one was a really getting\nInto the why can't you afford to and it's because of the stuff like that so if we can help people with some of the basic be prepared for a financial emergency get your budget and your dad in order then it all becomes easier to see and people can plan and start making those other decisions about saving for retirement saving for house whatever it might be\nSo fewer to guess if this thing is going to become bigger the side car this this um the savings into smaller count that people can tap you think it's going to be something that the big providers are going to go with\nI Hope so I mean the thing is first the\nPeople in Congress need to figure this out so I when I was reading the article that you sent they were saying well there are these legislative hurdles and all this stuff it's like well you're the Congress men when I Would just change the law and make this dual it's not all that complicated to make this easier\nAnd I do things so that to your question about will the providers to it I think so because like I said the mechanisms are already there you know the ... the systems and all that stuff are in place and there are lots of different ways you could do

up lifting the security phrase I opted to leave my credit open for\nTen days so they asked you for a date when do you want to lift the phrase and then when do you want the free to be automatically reinstated and so during that ten days my experience report was vulnerable but that was when I applied for the credit card was accepted\nAnd then at the end of that ten ten days automatically back to

S. and P. for instance is up ten percent and the given year\nHow much is the contract can give you day if you owned it is it five percent four percent of that so if if the market's up ten and I get five percent I Would get a fifty percent per participation rate and if I get seven percent on ten percent up I Would get Seventy percent so that's the insurance amount that we are talking about his right in exchange for that you're not going to participate in the last\nWhat the other thing you need to consider and this isn't talked about often either is the costs associated with that in New Jersey right they can be very expensive\nAnd we know that there's a lot of people out there that have to do it used in one of the things that we have to look at is what are the costs what are the surrender charges what if you need the money what if\nSomething happens is a health care issue and you need the money what does it cost you to get your own money back that's one of the things that you have to look at yeah absolutely and you're talking about surrender charges they're right surrender charges and what about internal charges\nWith these equity indexed annuities do they have internal charges that you can see\nYep they do of course they do you know they're going to have insurance rates right there could be writer fees involved in really to sing with this way new to complexes are incredibly complex and not all annuities are critical so he made a good point do we have a ... but not every minute is created equal\nAnd you just need to buyer beware you usually do your research you know there's a lot of people out there who sell annuities and that's the only arrow in their quiver and they wanted to make it work for every circumstance and we want our listeners understand there is a cost to that and make sure you understand the contract\nWe did get a second question as well to any this one comes from gene should I be doing raw conversions now that I'm retired Mandy welcome back\nBay so that is a great question and one that we kind of get a lot of them are going through our financial plan that generally speaking yes you have\nSome lower tax here but you always have to look at a couple of things when you're doing rough conversion first being how are you going to pay the tax\nIf you're getting harassed converging you're taking money from an IRA that it differed from an income tax and put in pain attacks that how you gonna pay that tax you have cash in hand you have a joint taxable account or a truck how they can do at that from\nYou're welcome to any kind of a man who directed client learning and development at ad wealth management with another of our women well we can event baby cameras cabin where family after like a cottage cabinet heritage who want to avoid the Tammy argues problem to join up and down grounds on Wednesday on campus nineteenth\nAnd we'll cover it off from uninvolved beneficiary to keeping it out of the hands of creditors and divorce settlement\nDuring a friend in wealth and wisdom events are completely free and very informative\nLeaned more and signed up today at ... dot com slash event lash cabin\nAdvice and opinions expressed during money talker so he's out of the house or gas ... addicts wealth management and not WTO O.

six three seven or you can always drop us an email to\nShoot me that email asking Andy ... investing sense dot com or going to keep an eye on the inbox there throughout the show but ask candy at investing sense dot\nCom so we're going to get started Andy there was a big story recently from your industry independent financial advisors and every year the publication barons ranks the country's top independent financial advisors and they came out with their most recent ranking just a couple of weeks ago\nThere was a familiar name to hear on the list for the first time and it was a very good rang for a day to you on the list yeah\nFinancial engines we're incredibly proud to be named to\nOne of the list yeah financially engines we're incredibly proud to be named to barons list of top\nIndependent investment advisors their first time on the list we debuted at number twelve and this was out of like the top forty firms uh the barons rank this year interestingly enough my parents actually had to expand the list from thirty to forty spot this year and that was due to this incredible growth that we're seeing right\nNow you know America's age how you got ten thousand baby boomers who are turning sixty five every day in this country and this trend is going to last for what another decade\nLuckily for for those turning sixty five right now you've benefited from this nine year bull market in stocks plus housing prices are up\nTo what that means is more of you are ready\nAnd in a position to retire so if you could use some help taking that step please get a second pair of eyes on on your financial future it's great if you're working with the broker it's great if you're working with with an advisor or a planner\nBut this is too important for you to just kind of you know hope for the best to get over to investing cents dot com set\nTime to talk with our local team now Annan Texas has taken a cell phone or offer to call with a question at eight eight eight eight three three eighty six three seven she'd like to know about an annuity to help her with income in retirement and thanks for calling how can we help\nThanks for taking the call today first of all and I will be five years old ... day and I'm working to try and much income or later in life are firemen out what's going on in\nAfrica and I can't wait to though I had her heart at your show all my heart of show unfortunately and you say that you didn't\nReally know what I had an owner finance mortgage snow\nAnd it runs out and about eight years All right I was considering I knew it for me to play after five years\nUm if you don't really like that I can you make any sense yes on where it wouldn't be safe and I really I get at least ... if not more\nAbsolutely so Ah yes we were talking about a annuities I'm not a fan of of these insurance products um I think they're complicated too complicated for like Ninety nine percent of of people out there I think they're expensive\nFor what you get um I think they're better for the people selling it to you then you the person buying it and I think people deserve to be better than\nYou know just being some food source for their broker a they're only there they are in a liquid so you put your money in in anywhere between six and twelve years down the road you can finally pull out the you know the last of your money without any penalties\nSo you only in a couple of situations do I ever think that it's okay for for somebody\nTo purchase um these insurance contracts if you're the parent of a special needs child and you're trying to create a a trust\n'em that can fund some sort of income stream for the child after you're gone um if you are very very old and have literally nobody else to help you\nWith your your financial picture you may be buying immediate annuity and created a an immediate income stream off of that\nFor the rest of humanity I think that there are better ways to go about setting up an income stream I'm so that you're not you know kind of you know held at ransom\nBy these insurance companies with these lackluster products are are you going out and looking for information are people starting to contact you or are you being pitched one of these insurance contracts now where are you right now\nI'm looking for an investment to give the money or\nAt least for now going to come from a four O. one K. right now I watched it go way down\nInto found a\nWay that we you know cry the oil white right by my own company I work for um it's all funny not stop right I wasn't scared I Know oil wasn't an issue yet\n[laughter] I just got to leave it you know role but I said well now\nNow that it takes five and I I ... heart\nFrom place where well go out and then that stock market crash so I did good last a long time ago from I ever really work with the natural mad and um I have\nA little small and that's when I hear from her from years ago and they pay me get at the end\nAnd I was just thinking about doing that or you know I can kill it stops you can buy though I prefer to roll it over rather than take the money and and I find that utility that law how much money you're going to\nI'm considering a natural manager and I thought why not start on the radio on at all\nSure no one guy and then I'm Glad you did so you know you're thinking about things the right way so what you wanted to I mean if you're going to be sixty five um what the what the Centers for Disease Control are telling us\nIs that um if you're if you're turning sixty five on average\nYou're going to live another Nineteen years\nNow that means that half of Americans are going to live longer than that half of Americans are going to live you know less than that but the point is you're gonna have\nWhat could be a couple of decades of life left of time left in the market so at at no point do I ever want you to take on more risk than you need but if you do something like you're thinking about what this annuity you're opening yourself up to different types of risk\nThat you don't need right now and as as we move through the the next couple of years in the market as we move through um you know just your life in general\nYou want kind of two things always working for you you want some sort of gross component\nThat's going to be in stocks that can help inflation proof your money\nAnd then you want some sort of income component that is going to be able to pay you a an income stream\nAs you kind of live out the rest of your days the uh the the annuity that you're thinking about doesn't really do either of those all that well it it's great for the company that puts it together because they're you know charging you an arm and a leg to make this happen\nBut what I Would have to think about is you\nKnow sitting down with with somebody I can uh you know hold on here after the call I I Want to get a couple of more pieces of information I'll reach out to my partner's down there in Houston\nSo that you can talk with somebody but what you basically want to do is create some sort of paycheck for you as you move through the next couple of decades\nAnd so as long as you have the rights I'm a investments for you and your particular situation it may be some similar stocks that to what you're doing there may be some different types of investments that we bring in to create an income stream for you\nBut I think that you know that is what I'd rather you do don't spend your money on these insurance products they're too expensive for what you get there going to tie up your money I'm as the market changes around you you're not going to be able to to adapt and that's just not a good place that you want to be you know with your with your money\nOkay well good for the topics that one and get them by what they are\nAwesome awesome you hold on we're going to get you some help in luggage squared away I Will do it there and thank you\nWhen it comes to planning for income in retirement if you've been saying this all year\nThat step requires a different skill set it's just not as easy as plowing money into the stock market and watching it grow but this is all about preserving and protecting and generating income and and accomplishing that requires a different skill sets\nIt does and and we're getting in some help\nBut if you could use some help planning for for your retirement income get over to investing sense dot com set time to meet with our local team ask about a service that we offer called retirement paycheck\nA it's an annuity alternative because we designed it to deliver a regular income but with a lot more flexibility and that a lot of lower cost than what you would find with these uh you know kind of very complicated insurance contracts\nNow Jason has sent a question to our ass candy and investing cents dot com and box and he writes Andy I'm new to investing and I don't have much to invest and I was wondering if a robo adviser account was worthwhile it looks good on paper what's your advice\nA great question Jason and you know look if you've got five thousand dollars or\nYou know look if you've got five thousand dollars or less then yes a robo adviser could be a good jumping off point\nNow you said that you're a ... that you're new to investing if you're young you have a long time horizon I'd go one step further and make this even easier for you just open an IRA or a brokerage account by an index fund that tracks the S. and P. five hundred regularly and fast\nAnd then once you get to maybe ten ten thousand dollars or so diversify a bit more by some small kept some international stock but don't make this more complicated than what it needs to be\nSo you know think about your personal situation you've got those IRAs got the brokerage accounts your situation is getting more complex you're looking at a hundred thousand or more saved her invested it's probably going to make some sense for you to get a second pair of eyes on your plan because now\nThat brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area like going to investing sense dot com now in future shows that he would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsk Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask any at investing sense dot com so\nJackie sent us for portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the state of interest rate is held to a majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay the skated rate is held the maturity and our FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation because look planning an income stream in retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now you've got rates where they are where they could be later on\nThe market in the environment or going to get even more difficult and\nBob you have you have Jackie's replied\nDo she wrote back I'm retired sixty seven have a pension and drawing Social Security my spouse has also retired and draws Social Security combined we have about a hundred thousand dollars in annual income from those sources and saving a portion so we don't get into our savings\nYeah right there okay it's a key point that I Want to you know for the kind of you know to focus on here they are still saving a portion of their retirement income stream\nNow I'm going to circle back to that and the second Jackie may not have realized that but she revealed to me of a little bit of risk aversion by mentioning these CDs\nSo in our email conversation I suggested some alternatives and realize you know we use any or all of the following types of bonds in clients' portfolios or you've got high yield bond flowing rate bonds\nMunicipal bonds corporate bonds multi sector bond fund or you know collective investments\nSo important to lay right now we're trying to keep the duration pretty short or even ultra short and because we think this is one way to manage interest rate risk and still get the potential benefit of a steady income\nSo let's go back to the key points about Social Security and pension income Jackie\nSaid that they are in about a hundred grand a year between Social Security and a couple of pensions right plus they're able to save a portion of that cash\nFlow each month in other words you know they can let their savings ride that this is this is very important in this kind of era of longevity that we're seeing right now\nUh you know when you understand that you're likely to have a much longer life in retirement\nYou start to realize pretty quick you know how vital it is to have your savings and investments work for you for longer\nSo with Jackie I was able to carve out an application to some different bond funds inside their overall portfolio and their their income sources and it was an allegation that made sense for their uh situation for their longer time and retirements while\nStill trying to manage risk against that rising interest rate environment if you could use some help planning your retirement income stream like this get over to investing cents dot com set time to talk there with our local team\nWe've got a call now from Andrew in New York He's calling with a question about the yield curve Andrew thanks for calling how can we help\nMy question is if you guys explain what have you heard of it looks like and how to determine when it when it's happening\nEnter this can be a great indicator but let's let's unpack this just a little bit but the yield curve does is it compares yields across different maturity\nSo imagine you you have this graph paper in front of you along the bottom left or right is the maturity of a bond like the two year after the ten year along the side\nFrom the bottom to the top is the interest rate of of the bond now imagine that you're drawing a curved line on that graph in front of you\nTypically what you see the shorter than maturity the lower the interest rate so that means that the lines can occur from the lower left up to the upper right\nSo what happens when the yield curve in verge is that the curve does not go from the bottom left to the upper right because the shorter maturity bonds have yield that's higher than the yield for those longer maturity bond so the inverted yield curve goes from the upper left down to the lower right\nIs there something else to the yield curve that we should be following for example what happens if it in bart's\nHistorically they're not always but historically in inverted yield curve can proceed a recession but you want to be [laughter]\nOr you want to be really careful with this if then or this this causality\nBecause it usually takes a long time between the inversion and recession we're going to continue to monitor things pretty closely and we'll let you know if and when the curb and birds just please do not be too quick to act on this information\nNext on the show we'll be joined by Don last can down as the chief investment officer at ... and you

percent so they use the money for just a big purchase or Thirteen percent said uh they simply spend on themselves or their family\nAnd seven percent use their retirement savings to pay for a

the younger generation today we don't know when Social Security looks like way down the road here right it could it the some changes could occur uh pensions are kind of a thing of the past so you really have to be your own advocate start putting that money away and\nThere is nothing better than that money compounding over the years but if you're taking money out it could have a big dent on that in the future\nYeah it sure does and you know when you come up with that income plan I think somebody folks you know just wait till so late in life you know you're not you're not getting you know it's tough you're young family maybe you're having kids right and you're just kind of swimming\nAnd ready to try to spread ... tried to get sleep right or you're thinking about money and they're just trying to get your sleep right now but um you know there's some great there live shows even if you start\nEarly in life and and take off for a period of time because now maybe expenses are a little bit of hires you're buying their first home and raising the kids and what not to get back into it it makes a big difference but\nThat's really negated you know that early start when you start to take that money out and just kind of wife set out and just you know make make sort of a problematic issue when when that money that you're working so hard for you know you're drawing down so early I mean you and I experience one of the effect of things there was\nIt may may be shocking is a little bit of a strong word but surprising to me when I got into this industry working exclusively with retirees was really simply the fact that\nThat really is an emotional you know if you think about that they're kind of transfer from working lived to retirement\nYou know crossing that bridge if you will it it it really is an emotional decision that I think from so many levels finances aside for a moment for a lot of people you're spending a huge percentage of your life there are at work right right and now suddenly that could be your social network maybe your friends things that I knew somebody that's gone\nNow you have these retirement accounts that hopefully been diligent saver and you're sticking money away riding markets go up and down you don't worry about a minute for long haul it's just a paper last it's going to come back\nWell now suddenly you're a little bit more concerned because I don't have an income coming in and if that's not hard enough I'm also taking money out of this account that I've done nothing but their money into mhm right but if you're taking the money out early like we're talking about here today\nThat money's not there in the balance is even smaller so now it's even more stressful that longevity issues just waiting on you like a\nYou know a couple of times I don't know what are ways but I imagine it's pretty heavy right but you got all this bird and argue that becomes problematic so\nYou know for folks I think it really comes down to just educating yourself you know coming up with the budget we talk about all the time\nEven if you're ... to take money out maybe there's some areas you can cut that out\nYou know at some of our classes where we

Wisconsin dot com and we got Brad Allen here today\nMan it's a good time to be a sports fan and Wisconsin I Love it I don't want to get off topic but boy as exciting stuff but not very often that all three so football basketball started right in baseball and they're all playing at the same great port report yeah especially for him Wisconsin here but boys that exerted my son\nIs eleven years old and he historically argued watch some of the game different games of me but didn't have time to do about a year ago I don't know if it was going in the middle school or something turned on and now he's got all the staff who knows who's playing who the best players are so it's got no starting for us to watch but a\nGreat topic this week we're talking to you know about kind of a major mistake a lot of young folks make when it comes to retirement savings\nAnd that's taking money out to sooner tapping those savings for whatever comes up in life and we've been around the topic a little bit bread but walk us through why it's a bad idea to pull from your retirement savings too early\nLife who just never withdrawing money from their retirement accounts before you actually retire\nWherever we want to get extra cost fancy car and a bigger house go out and killing all the dreams\nEar buddy and you know if you withdraw from your four one K. before fifty nine and a half we talked about it early but that money is going to be taxes regular income and you're most likely going to pay a ten percent penalty as well so let's use an example so withdrawing ten thousand dollars\nFrom your four one K. before fifty nine and a half\nIf you're in the twenty five percent tax bracket you'll have to pay two thousand five hundred dollars in taxes and another one thousand dollars in penalties that means that ten thousand will costs you an extra three thousand five hundred dollars the other big reason not to withdraw early for retirement account too that you're\nYou're robbing your future self old money that you're going to need and retirement even if you replace the money you take out you're losing out on the power of that compound interest so how big of a deal is that let's take another example here so ten thousand dollars\nOver thirty year period from January of Nineteen eighty eight to December of two thousand Seventeen a ten thousand dollar investment in the DSM V five hundred index would have grown two hundred eleven thousand nine hundred dollar while that's\nA lot of money to lose out on over that span of time so there are few exceptions early withdraw penalties\nI recommend talking with your financial advisor before pulling any money out of your retirement accounts even in retirement you know even in retirement when you're when you're done working you want to have an income planned to figure out which account makes the most sense tax wise to draw from so\nYou know a ... associates we offer a comprehensive report on retirement planning it's our our three sixty approach which you can find more information on wealth Wisconsin dot com about some of the things we do day or some of the things we talk about but\nSo get I Want to emphasize that IRA stands for individual retirement account you you will need the money when you retire so I don't recommend withdrawing early but if you have to do in an emergency\nYou know there are some times that you may you may need to but if you do do that you really have to go back to work on and putting that money back into the IRA right I mean I really just try to build that up as much as possible and try not to touch in the future so\nYeah I think you bring up a great point you know coming back here in our guest making up for lack of a better word for for taking I maybe early withdrawal can make a big difference and that's ... I think maybe the part that a lot of folks mess right\nUm we always encourage you to send in your questions we will respond to those throughout the week and we try to pick one or two each week that may be hurting into a big portion of the listening community I was out a out this week grocery shopping brown and\nI guess it's that a high pitched voice that I have children but somebody recognizes my boys and said hello so\nI realized I we have to listeners my mom and not that right or no answer I we're getting up there so anyway I could have said we have a great question here that that I Want to cut a pitch to your bread and\nAnd I'm Mary from while a toaster wrote in and said I've already turned on my Social Security are there any strategies that I can still utilize and I think\nThis for me it leaves the question we get a lot of cars some folks you know they just turned sixty two they get the statement that they are I'm supposed to turn it on don't know any better maybe they'd come to one of our classes or or they learn some more information and and now they're wondering what to do\nYeah I mean after a one of the classes that we teach you know every class at seeing somebody comes up and says I Wish I Would have came to this you know three years ago or whatever it was but a lot of people turn it on at sixty two just because they don't know if it's going to be there in the long run they don't know what kind of strategies are out there there's there's five hundred different ways you can take this thing\nAnd you know taking an early is not the end you know ... let's say you turn your Social Security on at sixty two you have that fully year to to go back to the Social Security office and say I made a mistake I Wish I hadn't taken it\nYou will have to pay back what you've taken the Bennett says if you never took it before or you can wait till your full retirement age which will be different for everybody depending on your your birth date but maybe sixty six maybe at sixty six and six months maybe sixty seven\nBut at your full retirement age you can suspend your benefits\nAnd it just means you're turning off your Social Security and one thing a lot of people don't know is that you know from sixty six to Seventy Social Security grows eight percent per year when you're not taking it\nSo as soon as you suspend those benefits or you stopped taking it it's going to start to grow at eight percent per year so if you have taken it early you wish you wish you hadn't done that there are still some options out there but you want to sit down again with your financial professional and make sure that\nYou know whatever you're doing with Social Security or any of your accounts I mean it all plays into the bigger picture right it's all of the puzzle pieces going together so you want to put that together\nGreat information wherever you appreciate that you're listening to their retirement already show on WGM Jay [noise]\nMy side of health\nAt Lincoln contractor supply invaded ranch the cat rental store\nTo names Wisconsin contractors trust for tools and equipment sales and rentals your covered and cat ... orders aerial equipment and work tools to job tools and supplies ... famous for compassion equipment and concrete vibe writers\nPumps generators like towers power Charles saws and more ...

Wisconsin\nDot com got Fred Allen here as usual my sarcastic yeah is it going good times good we have a good time of year and great topic you know we're talking to you know this is ... ... you know maybe a financial planning went to one but I think it's something that\nIt just appears the younger generation is missing quite a bit and that's the folks that may bird discipline to start some savings at some point and and you know for whatever reason they're tapping into those early in life we\nTalked about some of the tax penalties and really the long term consequences of that you know when biggest question we get you know so for younger folks that are listening to me\nYou know it's hard to envision right you know you're in your twenties or thirties or you're thinking about something thirty or forty years later I'm One thing when I have the opportunity to talk to younger folks I encourage them to do\nBecause really visualize you know what does retirement but for your we talk about the wide behind retirement\nYou know why I say ... what does this mean volunteers volunteering for charities are traveling the world is sitting in a garage working on your hot rod is it working in the garden as it's spreading it as much time as you can with your kids and grandkids\nYou know picture what the book sites and I think when you have some dreams and goals of makes it a little bit you know look at how something of value to save for an makes it a little bit easier I think conceptually thinking about this\nTime period three or four decades later can be\nCan be challenging but but if you do that hopefully it'll help you be focused and not take the money out early ... you know for folks you know that that are considering taking money out what are some alternative to taking money from their retirement accounts\nWell we always recommend having an emergency fund having that three to six months worth of expenses it's like a safety net you know uh about fifty seven million Americans have no emergency savings at all or worse yet nearly a third of baby boomers claim they have no money saved that's a dangerous position to being so close to retirement so\nIf you have an emergency fund a three to six months worth of expenses you will be ready in case something happens I'll tell you what I mean especially in retirement the same things happened in retirement that happened while you work in the car breaks down or the\nThe roof is leaking water heater goes out whatever it might be\nNot having to take that money out of the four one K. especially the market is down is very important so the key to starting an emergency fund is starting small\nSet up auto payments to to put aside maybe just twenty five dollars a week or a month and then add another twenty five dollars the following week and just start building that up so keep doing this each week and before you know what that emergency fund has created so really important you know I think that's one of the first question to be asking in a\nRetirement planning putting a plan together is how much do you have saved you know in cash or something safe that's very liquid that you can go to if\nYou needed in retirement so something you definitely want to think about and build up before you decide to retire\nYeah I think that's important and you know it's just about starting somewhere or no we can all four to start at different levels but you know I think starting somewhere is important you know and and you know switching gears a bit if you will bird you know what else

poet secretary\nAnd secretary came to us as a shining example of aristocracy big and some\nFull of charge he walked with styles stood tall and display the best manners on paper he wasn't perfect losing five but it's Twenty one races as if to say I'm only human\nBut to the guy he was profession itself and when he performed you took my breath away\nYet some may I ask how could he have been voted thirty fifth among the twentieth century fifty greatest athlete\nFurther more how could a horse place a close second behind wilt Chamberlain unimaginable hundred point game on ESPN who's number one list of greatest sports performances by an individual athletes\nAnd the answer because he was secretary\nAnd he was more than just a horse and on this day in Nineteen eighty nine secretary died\nLet's take a listen to his story [noise]\nOr you had to\nKind of a princeling quality amount and physically\nAnd mentally temperament and give the physique yet in the heart had really speed great stamina\n\nThe grants which are made by Sadler wouldn't fit in that special ones made under that big belly is sent by experts that he was the perfect for us in measurement man\nYou could look at secretary you knew that he was something special in addition to be an extraordinary couldn't run\nA that was a very imperious or look to um had a big flashy competing hold on I'm On when the sun's rays had I mean there was a beautiful city God intended to make a horse\nYou can't anticipate great you can't really define it I suppose it something that that that guy every once in awhile station somebody\nBecause it comes from God [noise]\nLet's pick up the story that more key qualities spark investor interest throughout the racing world\nAnd early Nineteen Seventy three shares for secretary were sold for record total of six million dollars then after winning his first to start the year the unexpected happened in Kentucky Derby tuna and aqueduct racetrack in Queens New York\nHere's Jim Daphne secretary exercise writer\nOf the day before the wood memorial I worked in an April ... mile and I had to kick him to make him work and I never had to do that but I told the foreman or something no matter what this for us I said you better have a checked out and this word never got back to Lucian lawn\nRomney's has a horse was acting funny in the gate and every time you pulled on a range or just head back that he had never done that and he couldn't understand\nAnd as you can imagine the investors worn thrilled I mean they're just popped down six million and then the tune up to the derby just a terrible run and they thought what we've done\nWhat would the derby just two weeks away serious questions arose about the jockeys ability to guide secretary to victory in the first leg of the triple crown secretary trainer Lucian Lauren didn't know what the thing\nBut others were losing confidence in the horse\nSecretary came to Kentucky where they shoot we should never be\nAll of a sudden ... more and brings him and the lawyers on there's just all this controversy about the rumors that he might have hurt himself or in the wouldn't Morial n and Jim is agreed to bed time will go around telling people\nTo weaken the derby the horse was lame this horse was such a great two year old he was horse of the year as a two year old and now he's coming in here with a chance to be maybe the greatest saint John's man of war but you can't block out all these rumors that\nAnd you wonder what's going to happen here today\nBut with all those negative rumors secretary which still like three to two favorite to win the biggest rate from his young life or by the way the biggest race and race in a record a hundred and thirty four thousand homes were the expectation\nThat says Churchill Downs oil Kentucky on this Saturday in may Nineteen Seventy jak what a guy and there it was Ninety nine running\nThe Kentucky Derby oh\nWell that's another style\nDiet and then the game my down again ...\nOn the inside of that time to live but I Am\nShe broke dead last and he was dead last after a quarter of\nA bias that hard on the outside not by that\nSpring the three year old Ian\nHere rather than making up his own mind to seem to understand that she\nSeemed to want to dictate whose own strategy\nThat fought the moving up on the outside and now they got out of the threats that Santa LA and\nThen he made this tremendous move and we knew that we have seen something in his car and [noise] and maybe perhaps we're going to have a very troubled\n[laughter] right on the outside and I read\nVegan anyone come a time in your store got like just the nice thing down any you win by two and a half varies\n[noise]\nIraq [noise]\nPeople were looking at the top or he ran the last quarter mile a twenty three seconds which is unprecedented where the derby secretary did something that no worse or did he went each other five quarters faster at justify launcher another quarter mile you might have taken to the air and Sloane which is obviously much was in his blood\nIs the first tours to run the mile and a quarter derby and under two minutes secretary turned would have been uneasiness and Louisville into confidence in Baltimore\nYou went off as a three to tend to favor in the Preakness Stakes typical race course where I live just six miles away and it's been my favorite Saturdays in my life for eight years this is the tightly turned second leg of the triple crown\nIt's almost right eight are just just about to move into that starting gate the weather is perfect and we're just waiting for applying for a stray\nCAT scan running for style and of course we carry wind I'm turned\nHim to college consider gas tied to that was the one I was raised\nIn a way that they drain on the outside of totally size and also touching on the outside in the Preakness\nApril glass together\nNow he's going to the turn you think it's going to be the same thing as the derby\nSecretary and\nGot a hold of them made it for almost ... percent pro gesture with his hands like a man of just because [noise] took the words the outside anyone who\nWent from last year first and about a hundred and ...\nAnd under any deal right house kind of secretariat moving fast going to be outside and it's right now you're talking and\nHe just accelerated into circled the feeling I say good lord one is sort of caught thinking about I mean his horses because she just didn't see a horse ever make a movie like that especially in\nThe first time it was far too early for him to have been in strategic manning let me ask you do I'm sitting in the race for my son to\nViolate camp on the outside down\nOnce I got to go to lead there and I just drop him in around [noise]\nDuring his ... and I knew in ... in his own show it's you know we just rolls in alone\n[noise]\nI went into another level of consciousness in the public eye there were actually kids standing on the radio as he came by the source has now capturing the ... not just of racing around\nHer and secretary or did it again today they won the ... the pillow and he's now two thirds of the way toward the triple crown\nExpectations were very high for any war is not just secretary to win the triple crown after twenty five years in citation and one in Nineteen forty eight there'd been a lot of very good horses at a tried and failed winning the triple crown seemed almost impossible to was tantamount to the four hundred hitter in baseball or the DiMaggio fifty six game heading straight\nThis was something that the most Americans in violent contribute will never happen again no one will ever win the triple crown\nAnd what great story telling about one of the world's greatest resources and an American favorite\nAgain the number two sports performance of all time by an animal or not just any animal secretary that remarkable performance at Belmont racetrack which will be nearing later and by the way as I said earlier I'm a huge horse racing fan my little girl competes\nIn hunters and jumping and she does all kinds of crazy stuff on horses and\nThe thing about winning or Kentucky Derby the Preakness and the Belmont is that it's just so hard\nIn modern life because of specialized breathing and the derby all considered like a middling race the similar do the Preakness well that's a sprint that's in Baltimore only two weeks later and then four weeks later off to New York for the Belmont and that is a mile and a half\nWhich is well it's like a marathon for a horse it's a whole different kind of breathing that allows you to win the sprint the mid and then of course that long haul race in New York\nAnd so few horses have done it and so if you did it and the way that well the way that secretary it did it was just remarkable by the way we did a story about one\nTriple crown winner American pharaoh me my dad and American feral written by Gary Ginsburg you can go to our American network and listen to that it's a ... about a father and son passion for the great sport of horse racing and of course justify\nJustified did it too and want to triple crown not too long ago\nAnd still great to see America get fired up about these triple crown winters and that it's still relevant sport today well means a lot to me and that's why we're doing this story in the end rarely do I editorialize but again the love of horses and horse racing comes about when we come back\nMore of this remarkable life story the story of secretary here on our American story\n\nMm what campfires how about a campfire atmosphere with friends and brought to your ears wherever you are\nThe secretary was one of his creature\nMaybe wish but two of them go and that was really one\nWas really an almost supernatural experience or\nReally was [noise]\nBy leaped up out of my chair at Belmont Park shouted never see this again and I get to the elevator to go down to the winner's circle\nAnd I'm standing next to Peter ... and he said I used to think that the alley Frazier fight in Madison Square garden was the greatest thing I've ever seen this was even greater everybody was\nEach and then when it's set in [noise] people will cry [noise] I actually saw people crying at this and that I mean it was such an overwhelming\nLead me these coed mining radio\nShows on me\nJack Nicholas one's called me over and said you were out the Belmont you saw that\nRace nice of you as\nYou said I was all alone in my living room\nWatching and as he came down the stretch\nHauling away I applaud them [noise]\nAnd I cry and they were said to him in a in a moment of epiphany and inside he said jak don't you understand he said\nAll of your life in your game you've been striving for sexual\nAnd he said at the end of the Belmont wars on when you beat a track record you normally be the by the second he not to second maybe to him off the track record and won by learning one length there was no there there's no horse in the history of horse racing could never be secretary on that day so\nYou're not supposed to win majors by a dozen strokes you're not supposed to score a hundred points and you're not supposed to win the Belmont by during one way or the\nDesperation way in which the losers\nWere she'll be in so battered ... Confederate Army staggering home after acrobatics I mean did you will flowery ridiculous things we can say hey it's gotten better horse racing [noise] I'm Sorry is yours was an athlete\nBut this is more than a story about a great American horse has the story of a great American team the team leader and he generally in Nineteen Seventy one with her father a victim of all farmers the family's horse farm again losing money generate siblings originally planned to sell the operation when their father can no longer run it\nGenerally however wanted to try to fill her father's dream when the Kentucky Derby a housewife and mother of four fired longtime trainer Casey Hayes and hired Roger learn to train and managed the metal stable horses\nOr and help to cut costs to return the operation of profitability before leaving you may have Nineteen Seventy one generally hired his father Lucian learn in Nineteen Seventy two they guarded the metal farms coal Riva Ridge to victory in the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes\nAgain it was a great movie script that Riva Ridge did\nHer farm manager and I'm not sure ... said to me after Nineteen Seventy two\n... I'm Sorry hey road from us tweeting next year she's not going to Seattle a lot of excitement was ... next year she got nothing\nAnother Carson nothing was secretary of\nWere it not for any ...
