they're not allowing you you're not allowing you to do what\nThey had ... like for\nYou know I understand the insurance companies they know they're not willing to pay you know what you're claiming that you do your road\nI get it so what's your question insurance companies just says no we're not going to pay that amount of money we're going to give you this that they offer you any money yet at all\nWell they have not and it's been a year and a half ago yeah but you're but you're still treating correct\nYes than in other words I have to pay for treatment and there are other than that I Would

already in touch with the insurance company insurance company is already accept the fact you're not liable is that correct yes\nAll right so now you're only ... only talking yeah the damages and your insurance company doesn't want to pay Fifteen thousand bucks okay so you're turning around sooner now you can sue the other driver\nA who will of course not answer or you'll get a judgment and ah then when you don't collect your judgment venue to your own insurance company three years down the road to just go to your own insurance company and say here\nAt this point it's forget the other driver your insurance company will go after the other driver under age ... nation claws\n[laughter] what I Would faith and they found out and they found\nNo matter at this point yeah I Know I Know ... almost never saw her a one filed\nAnd by the way for people that don't know is are ones you have to file is more than five hundred dollars or the damages both sides have to firewood and with the DMV and who

afternoon news with John McHugh news radio WGM Jay [noise]\n[noise]\nOne of the most difficult questions I'm ever asked Ken it's been true since I went on the air in the mid eighties that's last century Nineteen eighties is what do you do with a time share you're stuck with then it's today's Clark rages moment [noise]\n\nShe was just a moment [noise] time\nShares or defective product whenever you have anything that you can buy but you can't sell\nIt but the fact to product is not a normal function of capitalism time shares don't work time shares really were okay\nThe companies that push so hard to sell them would be willing to buy them back from you they're not because they know they're selling you something uh basically no value\nI hear from people all the time desperate downloaded timeshare and over the last four years I've had an increasing number of questions from people who are being patched by lawyers but the warriors are going to get them out of bed in return for paying a big retainer up front to the lawyer\nOften the rotator will be five or so thousand dollars\nWell now around the country according to the Orlando Sentinel a number of lawyers are facing fraud complaints including one of the biggest operators of this guy had questions about in the past named Johnson Philips who has now been disbarred\nFor a\nCommitting fraud against people telling them they were going to be relieved of their obligation for time shares\nNow these legal action going on against the lawyers around the country are all being spurred by the big time share developers so let's bring this full circle timeshare developers if you're so busy trying to get people\nTaken away from their profession or get people charged with actions fraud because they're trying to help people get out of time shares don't you think the real thing here\nIs that you need to come up with a system where when people want to dump a timeshare you're there for them to dump it too\nBecause obviously a product that people buy bay cannot later cell is something people shouldn't buy from Hugh in the first place you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nAnd my

as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack from the Russians the Chinese another foreign actor\nIran look at our list of potential enemies or do this\nCould be North Korea and we got a lot of such potential suspects\nOne a lot of people never have any cash anymore cash for a very short window would come valuable\nHaving a small amount of cash available stored in a place in your home small I mean for a lot of people just for walking around money under a hundred dollars let's say\nHaving that prevail herbal particularly for somebody who never carries any cash at all you should have it when I travel you know I travel a roughly thirty weeks a year\nI carry even though I never use it I have a supply of cash with me not a huge amount but I have some cash that if ever I had a serious problem where I could not access accounts but I still have some cash to function with\nThe second thing is and this is all Boy Scouts stuff right be prepared\nAnd let's go on the assumption that nothing terrible is going to happen even if it does everything will be okay after a little while\nBecause of the redundant systems have been put into place\nSo the other thing is if you have turned off paper statements from a banker brokerage\nAnd you are receiving electronic ones you need to print those out or store them\nIn your own backup hard drive or in the cloud although that wouldn't be as good as in your own hard drive you need to have some kind of record that if a bank database ever got white clean you have documentation at least going back to the last statement\nShowing what you had\nYeah again that's

Parker at first was only on line and now has physical stores\nBut not a lot of those either but for people who want to go see frames and get a sense in person they can go do that and to this idea dislike Harry's the the razors\nOriginally only on line now you'll see displays and I think target stores of Harry's\nAnd who doesn't take a lot of market share to disrupt the way and industry works a job that has been absolutely beaten into a pope\nAnd the marketplace by the online sellers particularly dollar shave club\nWho has affected them so much even though the online sellers now account for only a little more than ten percent of the razor market the mattress market somewhere ten to Fifteen Percent and sector after sector\nPeople who come up with the simple fact way to sell\nAnd one that is ultra user friendly and convenient and makes it simple for you to returning item if you don't like it no games no gimmicks they're gonna take market share because they've made it easy\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show oh John how you doing\nIn this house shows ... please call me Clark okay claw how are you today wonderful thank you hope you are I'm doing wonderful thank you for taking my call sure\nSo I have a quick question\nProbably not a simple answer the question [noise] I Know that when you hold a bank account you have FDIC insurance in unions have their own insurance but in the low cost um investors terms\nI Everytime I call and ask a bit the well we're not going to go bankrupt\nThat's no answer is it\nNo it's not so what kind of protection is\nSo it depends on what you're actually doing like if you own of a series of funds like you own mutual funds are index\nA series of funds like you own mutual funds are index funds\nThe value of what you have is controlled by the holdings inside that fine so the value when you invest goes up and down who find itself is not at risk unless the investments in it [noise]\nGo to zero\nSo let's say you buy 'em an index fund\nFrom one of the big discounters from vanguard fidelity Schwab someone like that who you know those three are taking so much market share or you end up owning a ATF from one of the you know one of the black rocky ts those are the the big discounters and the market\nThe money that is in a fund\nIs secure in that find there's never been a situation where a money has been stolen and it's just a well when the money's gone\nAnd money in a\nA brokerage\nDoes not have\nAs you mentioned FDIC insurance or anything like that the holdings are protected by what's called S. I. P. C. did anybody mentioned SSI PC to you\nI seen it at the bottom of the page when you're looking at the site\nAnd S. I. P. C. is a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have added a credit union through in the u._s._a. or at a bank through FDIC\nSo s IPC is a privatized version of protection and the most contentious cases have involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd S. I. P. C. has not been there to protect people\nAnd the event of a brokerage going insolvent BS IPC takes care of people but if it's involved fraud or something like that they don't\nPut your money how is it\nHeld is it in mutual funds or ...\n... mostly most of it as a mutual funds indexes in and I are a little bit of it is in money market now with money market would be different than the sun's\nYes so money market works a little differently and last decade during the ah banking scandals there were I think to money market funds\nThey couldn't pay out people's accounts and they went at least temporarily insolvent and it was a terrible problem very upsetting to people\nAnd a money market situation\nThe brokerage houses offered generally two options you can either have the money and uh pitiful you earning FDIC insured a account or you can have it in a money market account where the interest changes each day\nAnd I have my money\nAnd money market I'm not\nParticularly worried because even last decade when we had this this series a banking scandals\nNo one of any and there was no significant or meaningful loss for anybody from any of the money markets even the ones that temporarily went insolvent ultimately paid people the money they owed them almost a hundred percent\nWonderful thank you very much for answering the question the big risk always is with a smaller brokerage that may be crooked and that's when your money is at greatest risk if that gives you any comfort\nBut does thank you very much my best to you\nLast year thank you Bye bye\nRobert's with us on the cars

another recalling dealership and I and I didn't know what to think since I was thinking that any of the call so\nSo but a whale it through with it and I met a ... or ... at a bank and uh and\nShe was

recently really has made me hot under the collar [noise]\n\nJust a moment [noise]\nSo things are always going to come out you know Google had a data breach\nWhen Google had tried to compete with Facebook with this thing called Google Plus it didn't work at all and it was a big fail for Google and then on top of it\nThere was a data breach that are exposed people's personal information and Google chose to keep it secret\nBecause apparently they didn't want to ah hurt Google's reputation at a time where all the big tech companies are under a microscope so all they did was amplify\nThe damage done to them rather than just when you mess up you pass up period it's simple and of all people to know that gosh Google certainly is\nOne of the companies that should know that if you do have a screw up put people's personal information you need the talent\nThat there is something good coming out of this and that is that Google is launching a new initiative to make information through Gmail much more private\nAnd that's the direction they should be going but if you want to make sure that your emails are\nAs protected as I possibly could be use another free email service called proton mail which I've mentioned to you before bed is an email service that is ultra secure and private no prying eyes for search\nWhy don't you consider instead of using Google for search the dominant search engine and the country if you want more privacy in your life checkout duck duck go duck duck go is now ten years old\nDucked out go does not\nTrack your information dot dot go does not give ad results first to confuse you thinking it's the information you should be looking for\nAnd with most browsers whether you use a chrome from Google or Firefox or use safari or a ...\nEngine and use it knowing that nobody's going to be trying to capture your information and what you're searching serve you're looking for more privacy and your wife and you don't trust Google there's so many ways you can do this stuff\nAnd not have to worry about it\nThis was all part of the process\nOf trying to keep capitalism functioning in the U.S and so now is interest rates\nSteadily climbed towards real levels socks don't look quite as good and that's part of the fact of getting back to a more normal\nEconomic environment and so as a stock investor I'm changing nothing because I Know this is part of the game as it goes through cycles if there was money that I had an stocks that I knew I was going to need to use\nIn the next few years I Would be nervous because that money shouldn't be in stocks\nBut everything in life is about knowing the risk based on the time that you can afford to take risk\nSo money that you are putting in what say is most people do most people's involvement with the stock market is through a four one K. or raw tire ray\nAnd through a plan where you're invested in fines\nAnd if you're putting in each pay period or putting in regularly each month let's say in a Roth IRA\nDon't even Fred about any of this just remember that what happens today is pretty much irrelevant if you're ten or more years away from when you're going to need any of the money\nAnd you just keep going studies you go as long as the money you're putting aside in a retirement plan is well diversified well diversified what that means and simple English\nIs that having money and a variety of stocks not your employer zone fact ... percent I like for you to have an employer's own stock in a four one K. is zero percent\nThat your money should be well spread out the easiest choice if investing bores you confused as you were intimidated to you is going to target retirement fund the you're offered where you work for the year closest to when you plan to retire and not necessarily from that company but you plan not to work anymore\nAnd and a Roth IRA again if the whole thing about how to pick and choose investments is not your thing\nGo into a target retirement fund because that is a simple way so you diversify your money across many different types of investments and you diversify overtime\nAs long as you're doing those two things\nPutting money on regularly steadily for years to come\nWhatever they report about the Dow up the dial down the S. and P. this yesterday that the NASDAQ whatever if that's how we're going to see fine is not important as long as you were doing the basics of putting the money aside each and every pay period each and every month\nPam is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Pam how you doing\nI'm doing great how are you sir\nWonderful thank you Pam you want to money saving tip for me I gather\nWell yes I'm a you hadn't I hadn't listen I listen to my way home from work and you mentioned something about a jacket or how the new oil that you put your knees instead of luggage offensively\nYeah so when I fly on one of the deep discounters which we have three in the United states spirit frontier in a legion\nThey charge you know the way the business model works is they may sell you a ticket for twenty dollars one way but the baggage charge will be more than the cost of the ticket even for a carry on\nSo there are now a variety of sellers selling jackets clothing items that you can start off\nWith um clothes and them and you know or whatever electronics chargers whatever and nobody charges you for wearing a jacket so ah there's the biggest seller of the the one that's best known as Scotty vast\nAs so SCOTT E.\nV. victory E. S. T. Scotty vast dot com\nAnd the cost of their items is really expensive but I only buy from their outlet where they're getting rid of the things that were slow sellers\nAnd they fell vast jackets pants I'm a variety of clothing items that inside have all kinds of pocket so you can stop it and I have a tougher jacket\nThat I bought from their outlet that had nine pockets inside\nThat I can look up a ton of stuff so um last flight on spirit I flew with the big puffy jacket and this micro carry on I have that I got a Costco that Costco sells for twenty nine dollars\nAnd so I had no baggage charge at all\nWow and all that work to Europe and out of the international as well oh yeah All right\nYeah so are people stopping stuff and clothing is something Europeans have done for as far back as I can remember because there's a giant airline and Europe historically it's been one of the most profitable airlines in the world called Ryan air\nAnd Ryan error was the one that originally came up with the idea of charging people separately for everything and so Europeans have been way ahead of us find wearing clothing that you could just stuff everything in the pocket so you wouldn't have to pay baggage charges\nWell that's great well thank you very much and I'm going to check out the website and of course their outlet store\nYes or anywhere else you should buy other than the discount you can get because Scott invest normal prices\nThere are some serious prices and so the only way I Would ever buy one was something that had been a failed it was on the outlet\nI Am cheap sometimes aren't Scott's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Scott\nStay clerked thanks for taking my call how you doing today\nI'm doing great thank you hope you are\nAnd ... and a little rain here from the storm military [noise]\nOh I'm Sorry ... not too much\n[laughter] so my question is I I own two duplex in uh upstate New York and I have runners that turn over every couple of years or so [noise] um is that very frequently but um my question is um who would you recommend a for to provide a service for doing background checks out the central renters\nWell I'm going to suggest a couple of sites that have grown up since the real estate bust since so many people farmland orange now owning from typically one to five properties and it's hard to know how to do the background checks how to collect at an all that and I lived\nOn the Internet and there's a lot of trouble services out there that want to charge anywhere from you know Nineteen dollars to you know upwards of fifty dollars\nSo sure well let me tell you about several first\nCozy CEOs the why have you seen that one no cozy dot C.

voted or they vote but the ... the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do what I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard\nBut a ... it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option of this country if you don't use that that uh a franchise uh you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have trouble nobody likes to flabby franchise\n[noise] yeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nYeah but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved ... what are the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well who told is that you're powerless\nI Know and part of it also is the fact that they they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live in\n... and I thought oh why did I Know and that is the end of it was\nBecause of the failure of the of the ... the school system um and that's when you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um which I think it is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on\nThe hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects those guys so to speak and the uh the commanding heights of the culture and that they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but\nUh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college\nAnd are starting careers and a family is and so\nThey have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all of this so they're look they're now they're even more interested in in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nA parade in the series and creating catalyst and so on so our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and they give you an idea of the percentage of\nOf ownership I'm In these countries who was about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower ... northern countries and then of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give you a further idea if your rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth of them by country or it turns out that Denmark has twelve Switzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweeteners fifteenth\nI'm North Korea is at the bottom a hundred and eighty of but the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David throw us founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute the website independent dot org you'll learn more about these series\nThe love go and the catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be

history and the and the nature of an economy and so forth on the other hand they're intrigued by the idea of of enterprise and innovation\nUm and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation and\nThose questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant and compelling for people\nSo the the fact that millennials um are receptive and the way we're discussing um and we understand how they've been miss educated or misguided in interpreting certain things for example um ... have been taught\nThat the great recession and\nA two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market and even though the reality of it is that the federal government created\nThe recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government more him centered or the government steps so\nWhat do I have\nWill realize that these kinds of um iconic examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified\nIt makes a huge difference in their receptive to the to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with more with our guests David Thoreau again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and we're looking at a way\nThat new ideas and thoughts can

gives you might think because ... was a terrible public relations disaster for the city uh he he was a gangster who who was publicity who wanted to be alive\nWhile meanwhile the the people like a pregnancy who's actually named Frank NATO and others on on mob uh they went down a more traditional business role in that that kind of fit in with what the gentleman earlier asked about the business aspect of this the\nAh the the the parallel and even the uh the event the eventual emerging into legitimate legitimate business uh and I think to to touch on on the other question\nThe gym caught a mob for example all of those people pretty much grew out of the old Capone mob you have people you have people growing up they they started as drivers or their enforcers or they're going around picking up money and collecting\nAnd a lot of these people are or thought this young young man and then they grow into\nA you know they grow into positions of power ah it was pretty insulated even though ... was well known for not being ethnically pure ... you know he uh he had all kinds of ethnic backgrounds and the people that Betty assembled but the people that he trusted him that he assembled with them\nOr they they tended to stay close\nAnd the successors as you got it and others uh\nUh we we talk the book basically ends um in Nineteen thirty three with with the end of prohibition um but even that\nWe get into the transfer of power between a between compound to a ... you know friend idiots he's more commonly known 'em and then there's sort of an Epilogue A final chapter that looks more broadly at\nUh the fact that ah ... the battle between ness in compound both in reality and sort of the Mets the impact that has had and continues to have a on the city of Chicago and heads politics and the interplay between a crime and government tend and media and all sorts of those things\nI Would not prohibition would component of even existed as a mobster\n[noise] he would have been a low level criminal who never rose a much beyond where he started in life or in the in the slums of Brooklyn probably um you know he's he is out of the protege of a a fellow named John ...\nWho was really the first corporate minded gangster someone who realized that this could be a business and when prohibition comes in and creates this whole new market uh that his patronize by legitimate people not people who consider themselves outside the realm of the law he\nHe capitalize on it and sort of paves the way for for ... to do so and wants to ... out\nUm compound steps in 'em and it's this influx of money and and attention frankly again as Michael said coupon courted celebrity that makes him into the icon that he becomes and certainly we would never be talking about him or in the twenty first century if it hadn't been for prohibition\nIn terms of the the sheer power of the component mob is there any comparison let's say with the power wielded today in northern Mexico by the drug cartels\nBut certainly the same the same kind of thing a particularly if you you look at the way or the so called legitimate government can be being in league with these are ... ... with these kinds of groups or it was\nReally pretty much felt like a poet ran the city for a long time and I I think that probably was an oversimplification again he becomes such a public relations problem for the city that that the uh you know the people around him are privately\nCollaborating with with federal agents that get rid of him because the the idea was we have to it's early in the depression and he's a he's a bad or you know he's a bad black guy for the federal government in general\nThat's why why Hoover himself and I'm not talking about J Edgar Hoover ... president Hoover took a a major interest in and taking you know taking Capone down because at this time components feeding all of this popular culture\nThings you know all of the Warner Brothers movies like little Caesar and scar face and a public enemy and he is in Nineteen thirty one is uh the first filling in Dick Tracy pecan famous comic strip\nAnd also a Dick Tracy is I I was hit by myself I\nFound out from Chester Gould

followed to some degree is based on ... bone and uh every every a detective who had a snap room for door and a trench coat or Amazon earth\nOr even dishonest were were patterned after after after death\nOr is that he's he's a totally self interested individual he seems to be the ... are the kind of person who liked uh personally enjoyed making people feel good but it was because that was a

young boy interested in Sherlock Holmes and uh probably read the Carter\nDime novels and so on uh I I think we might mention too that they're they're interesting parallels between these two men because um they both they both are expensive immigrants they both have\nFathers who are are legitimate businessmen a barber in components case and in a case of really quite successful Baker who have bakeries and in Chicago area\nAnd I think it was the ... the ... uh influence of a brother or a brother in law Alexander Jamie who became a federal agent\nAnd to kind of a I think the melodrama and romance of bat\nActual real life detective being in his life really uh really drew a nest to it and there's also the element of him being a very very smart young man who ... who for a while it looked like he was going to be a lawyer and I'm\nAlso you know you have lawyers and doctors\nBut he looks at law enforcement and see that things are changing that forensics is coming in and out of a level of sophistication coming into law enforcement that and the before and he sees an opportunity\nMake law enforcement a real legitimate profession and so so that's his ambition that's his path fairly early because he's very on both these men are quite young when when they're famous struggle happens by you know late twenties\nIt it from that you know do you have you have ... in his mid twenties basically up into a too is just as early thirties when he's at is at its height and his downfall so so you have a you have these kind of parallel track between these two men because component is viewing\nIs one of the first to really view\nCrime at the business as a as an industry as a veteran so you have these two professional law enforcement and crime on a on a collision course in history\nYeah I Know they both died rather young actually I was a forty eight ... before\nI get ... forty yes for forty eight um he had just turned forty eight um and and that's in particular they both sort of had um\nA longstanding ... a health condition that they picked up early in their their lives in in ... case it was as simple as that ends up uh seriously manifesting itself when when he's in prison with NASA it's a it's a child at heart condition um\nThat he got one from romantic fever when he was a kid so they're both in some ways destined uh from very early on to live long lives and it's just a remarkable for me particularly sitting here I'm only I'm only twenty eight years old which is the same age that that and that was when he was leading the ... and you you can't help comparing yourself

it was after he got out of prison ... says they are they treated ... thanks for treating them he donated a tree that I think it's still growing there that they do they know anything about that and when that would've been\nYes that is absolutely the case um after Capone was released a he had he was he stayed most of his his prison term in Alcatraz or and then after he had this sort of psychotic break\nBrought about by syphilis he was transferred to another institution in Los Angeles um and then and then eventually released um taken to Pennsylvania for being released\nA and his family had already arranged with a a very well known expert in syphilis a doctor at a at a Memorial Hospital in Baltimore or to have special treatment and so he was brought their um this would have been in in

stuff and do we certainly a\nBut to find late Leah mullahs are are yanking turkey in the direction of are becoming more and more of an Islamic state and that's a very bad a circumstance both by virtue of the size of turkey which is a has a very large population\nA bigger than any nation I guess in a\nIn the western Europe and uh a country which is remains a key part of NATO which of course with the increase belligerence\nOf led a very potent and the Russians are NATO remains a very important alliance the Turks for a while or tried to obtain membership and that other Western European gathering the European Union but they at the time they were applying they simply\nWere moving in the direction away from a political freedom\nAnd uh they didn't pass muster\nAnd are these days are turkey which was once a a pretty reasonable ally with the the Israelis has gone the other direction they haven't got all the way there's really not Iran or Sudan\nBut this latest the circumstances just the latest example of what can happen when a country that falls into the throes\nA religious fanatics and that's the direction that turkey seems to be heading so we're certainly glad to hear that a river and Andrew Brunson has in fact\nBeen freed and I think we can safely say you will never returned to turkey which would feel like a pretty smart move on his part [noise] uh\nThe court in Turkey had sentenced him to three years in the months in prison for his conviction\nA but since he had already spent two years in detention he will not serve any more time Bunsen had rejected the espionage and terror related charges and strongly uh maintained or to the country that he had to gauge the no such activity\nAnd it it seems again that [laughter] it's highly unlikely that he did or that he would uh what it sounds like\nHere's another attempt at taking a shot if you will\nAt a at Christians in this world and I'm just curious you are your thoughts about all this is this a case of hyper sensitivity on the part of Christians is this a case of a a exaggerating it would seem not by the statistics I gave a just a moment ago\nThey were granted there are an awful lot of Christians in the world\nAre but there does seem to be a fair amount of persecution and what is particularly telling in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise]\nAh like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you you fall in with the identity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a a rich wealthy white western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even particularly true but if it were it still would\nThe point we are at least it ought to be ah beside the point\nIs that it is ironic indeed that some people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them it it's ironic certainly if the forces of fundamentalist Islam or where to take over this country the people they would go after first\nWould be what they would consider to be the liberate teen residents of safe places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest do appear to be a freebie tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet is kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished by the Christian Church and I certainly would not be one to say that the Christianity has an on blemish record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized and influence and in terms of of the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea uh the area of the world that is both consistently on free\nUnstable on wealthy would\nBe the swath of territory from roughly a Morocco across North Africa eastward through Egypt or the middle east and the further east do you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is uh\nThe armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct of behavior in the living conditions\nAnd says Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant\nOr if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise you'd have to give them credit and since\nIt's not been so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate and uh again yes of course there\nOf course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it so I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses of Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way\nAt persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become a force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of\nFree expression of individual rights to host of other things that could be put under the general a title of the western civilization just a sad circumstance\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing in Turkey a my guess would be more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by a President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPrescribing lay in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO not good for Europe of course a tidy chunk of turkey remains of the European continent with the bulk of it of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact this story has had a happy ending but for some of the others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which ah get curious er and curious or as a they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom in the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally true of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as it as persecuted\nWhereas a of a force which with the exception of the ... versions of a of communism is still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic or I'm Free portion of the planet\nThan bad portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that's not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation\nOf the portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown democracies of that area where are the homegrown supporters of a personal rights and the like uh the homegrown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nAh the answer is\nThey aren't anywhere they don't exist\nIt's a it's sad will come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a rubber Brunson that uh this is a\nA happy episode and voters are remaining a a very unfortunate dismal and depressing world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are considered I suppose handy by regimes such as the\nA a a a essay you're talking about the army Security Agency and uh yes I had friends of mine who spent some time in turkey that's true\nOkay well it was you know I was stationed in sitting up was his true which is as far north as you can go\nOut and real pretty close to the Russian border and increasingly you suddenly ...\nYeah that's what we're observing ... you know what I Want to talk about is the Turkish government of today is not Turkish government when I was there\nNo no absolutely not uh they were they were completely different um in fact the way I understand the constitution is written in such a way that a sort of the most part Sheree a law cannot be instituted\nNo that's the way it was written as\nEveryone is trying to change it now\nAnd as he tried to change it officially unofficially I guess it's largely changed\nYeah yeah it's and that's a shame because when I was there I mean I got along with a Turkish papal fantastic and say to this day I have several Turkish friends and what I get a kick out of most of lung restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater them in their neighborhood of language they look like I had two heads\nBecause they never had an American do that to them [noise] but yeah it's a shame that a country with the history that it has and the inroads in his late into modern technology and how they have developed or cities\nIn the last uh forty years is going to the is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think as a darn shame and I didn't know why the people of that country or standing on the allowing that to happen\nBecause there are various factions just as has happened in Iran you have any number of people who who uh tend to follow the notion of a of the individual rights and and free will and choice but you also have any number of people who frankly uh tend to form the lease educated part of the population\nWho abide anything a mullah tells them to do and that's the splits you have a tree or what you leave a anchor a a a symbol and places like that you get up in the countryside\nAnd you find a lot of people who uh\nWho could easily be a part of the the Taliban if they were in Afghanistan\nMhm and it's just I don't know it's just it it really bothered me like I said I I I Love I absolutely loved the Turkish people I Love the way that I was treated when I was there you know they treated me with a lot of respect a lot more respect and they're treating each other anymore\nAnd the way to why one buddy who circuit who sat down and talk about it he says a lot of these ... these are Muslims or fight over who is the closest relative to Abraham [noise]\n'cause they're you know it's a neighbor him like face and that is what they're fighting over this truly say they're the closest ancestors or whatever a ... a shoot and the uh that was the other the sheer say that they're the closest and that is what the findings about ...\nYes it is in Seventy how 'bout how 'bout fighting over what's the best way to raise the standards

that what they are a letter that says after careful consideration they're going to bring it back for birds\nPurple consideration they're going to bring it back for first thing I have an evening of community conversation of race and then one night performance of to kill a mocking bird and why is it the educators smart people many cases PHD's don't understand the significance of the plane of they're cancelling and how that plays into this national conversation about race racism all those things\nWhere I actually wonder how many people in it in the ... school district of actually read to kill a mocking bird at this point it was required reading when I when I went to school it wasn't when I was going to school is something that I picked up later\nA you know maybe the southern Gregory Peck movie I don't know but the reality is when you have to start out with an apology for showing an American classic\nThat discusses that goes right to the heart of the unjust treatment of African Americans that race and the importance of the rule of law in the presumption of innocence it goes to all those issues key issues that we're discussing right now today in society\nAnd they can handle it in the adult discussion in Charlotte and they're going to start off with a with an apology session that's basically what because you know it's not going to be an honest conversation about race they are going to have a conversation about how they're sorry that they had to present this play and\nAnd she you know maybe we should have been more sensitive and picked a different play or something like that feel\nThat it's all could have been if they wanted to do that\nThey could have done this months' ago leading up to their three nights production of this play and that's what you want to do but to do it after the fact one is just cancel it when there was African American students in the play that have no objection to it because a few parents complain you're going to scrub all the energy all the hard work\nLose the opportunity to actually inform your student body and their parents in some cases just seems disingenuous to me I don't get get the logic here and they should be smarter than that\nAnd what lessons early Sunday when they do it literally hours before the player's supposed to be on the\nOn the stage I'm a taxpayer perspective you just waste a lot of money out of production you're do you work your canceling do so now we're going to have this one night only because this is too controversial too hot to handle they should be given their their session Tuesday night with an apology that they haven't properly educated the students\nThat's where they should start in shorter way and say we're sorry we didn't give them the contacts ahead of time we didn't explain ahead of time what we were discussing and why this book is so important in discussing race why there's such a classic an American literature why we discuss this book\nYears after it was published in why it'll be important in a century from though\nDoes it surprise you that the the the people that are supposed to be leading the pursuit of freedoms and freedom of speech and understanding basic rights the civics lessons are supposed to be teaching our kids don't understand the basic\nHistory lessons that are in some of the literature of this country that they can use as a teaching moment they failed miserably here\nWell they actually have a teaching moment in the wrong wrong kind of lesson that unfortunately that the students of wearing they've learned that if they they feel the slightest bit uncomfortable the slightest bit of funds that they can shut up shut down a classic piece of work a classic a literature presentation\nYou also wrote a piece on actually my ... eleventh about my role in how Democrats are not behaving badly how does that kind of this well\nExactly what what you're seeing is that when the Democrats are constituencies they when they get upset they and they they feel the slightest bit upset\nThey can shut things down there and that's what their goal is to the shutdown anything that they disagree with anything that makes them uncomfortable as the political correct the silver age\nIn a ... ... there is a backlash effect of that but that is in part why Trump won\nBecause there's a large feeling among among the rest of the community that says wait a second we need to have these things out in the open we need to have these discussions and you can't just tell us to shut up anymore and that's why Trump was so effective\nAnd that's why you need good strong leaders likely a book we're\nTalking assemblies around in Boston as a as we lead up to November one of the big stories on the other side of the I was ... over the weekend rolled out he said he ten percent middle class tax cut is this anything but just power politics\nOh my God it is something where I almost couldn't believe it for a guy who said that we do not have enough resources to invest in things that are important to him and his party\nTo then say well we've got enough money to be able to do a tax cut well that's what you're basically buying into is what we're selling which is we've been so successful with balancing our budget we still been able to invest in our public schools and we cut taxes by over eight billion dollars\nSince we took off within twenty eleven so I guess you have to ask yourself the question do you believe that Tony ... is actually going to cut your taxes or\nDo you think it's just more campaign rhetoric I think the average person on the street knows it's nothing more than empty promises because he's got an awful lot of liberal special interests even running these commercials for him to do political payback so he's\nGoing to do things like repeal voter id get rid of act ten increased income taxes raise taxes on business or you know you name the regulation he's going to be for it and all those things are going to kill our economy and if you thought it was tough to find a good paying job when Democrats were in charge before it's going to be a heck of a lot worse with Tony ...\nChurch one of the big issues that the lawmakers are wrangling with this is Kimberley Clark meal or where do you stand on that and where do you think that storyline is going to go\nYou know I voted for it in the assembly and let me tell you why uh I think that we have to look and ask ourselves how can we be the most competitive state possible to bringing attracted new companies like we did with Foxconn\nBut I also think that we can never left the businesses who are here think that we're spending more of our time and effort on attracting a new job than we are to keep the great paying jobs that we already have here\nAnd if you live in the Fox valley somebody who works that Kimberley Clark is paid way above normal wage in our state and they have a huge network of suppliers\nBut also employ an awful lot of folks besides the jobs that are directly at the plant so I I was sympathetic to the argument made by lawmakers from the Fox valley I Do think it's something we're not going to do for every single company 'cause we could not afford that but I think for a a pillar company like Kimberly Clark or a new venture like Foxconn\nIt's certainly something we've got to look at it on a case by case basis what's going to happen in the state Senate I Do not know we've already had a more than enough Republicans come out who would not support the plan that it's going to take bipartisan support and this is a clear example where you've heard nothing from Tony ... you've heard nothing from the Democrats\nOther than empty rhetoric and they have to step up to the plate to their credit they did it for the buck Serena a few of them did it for Foxconn but I have not heard any Democrats come out saying they want to help save those Kimberly Clark jobs and that's disappointing\nYou got a couple of more minutes was around ... I Want to ask you I I'm an optimist again I think the governor will win reelection given that if that happens where do you see the agenda going for Republicans going forward after November six\nWell we want to focus on the things that we really been successful at reducing our tax burden investing in our great public schools and also looking at how government operates so part of my four year agenda with Governor Walker would be to look at every single way the state of Wisconsin operate\nAnd not accept the fact that we've done it the same way for the past decade or two but think a decade going forward what do we need to do to make state government the smartest Alina for the most nimble that we possibly can to not only grow our economy but to make ourselves ready for the twenty first century\nSo that's something that I think we're up to the challenge we want to be able to make government more efficient but do it smartly\nOr you saw today Governor Walker announcing that he wants to get back to two thirds funding for public schools were almost there anyways because of our record investments in public education but I certainly think that's a laudable goal for us to consider next session depending on our revenues of course\nBut I think that those are the kinds of things you want to focus on more money for school reform in government and keeping the tax burden affordable for every single middle class family to be able to stay in our state\nLasting for these kind of story continues to get better and better and better anything in this story line that causes you any paws or any concern it seems to be full steam ahead\nYeah not at this point um I Know I've talked to an awful lot of folks who are nervous about making sure that Foxconn is going to live up to their promises or the best thing about the ... the deal that was negotiated by Governor Walker and legislative Republicans\nIs that not a penny goes to Foxconn until they have already paid wages to employees or they've already put a shovel in the ground in a building is up in the air\nSo that's the best to guarantee that we have it's unlike other things in the past will be given tax credits hoping jobs will be created this is one where they don't get paid until after the jobs have already been paid and\nThe workers are on the job so I feel really good about the guarantees that we have and show should every single Wisconsin I as we know if they only create half the jobs they only er and a half the credits\nAnd that's exactly the kind of it we should have going forward and hopefully it'll be something people can buy into as we'd go toward November sex\nAssemblies me around and was always great to talk to you they get you to take care\nTo talk to you take you to take care\nInteresting

this is just a little tidbit we're going to hear more from rave Greco in the future but he was just a little tidbit rave\nWas down there after nine eleven he lives in New York and has spent his life there and he's a welder so right after this occurred right after the events he decided I gotta get down there and help volunteer I I've cut metal I'm a welder I Need to be there\nIs really the lack of a plan and you can talk and you can use talking points all you want but that's really not a plan that going to lead to reach anywhere promising when it comes to immigration reform so\nLook for that she'll keep saying comprehensive immigration reform what that means there's no detail behind that impressive title um the other big debates was between attorney general branch demo and his challenger Josh call and\nI was ... on a bunch of time a bunch of occasions just cause somebody who he seems to be running for the wrong office he he looks to be a guy who wants to be a legislator to make laws\nAnd not somebody that's going to enforce the laws and I think that's what we I think most Wisconsin I look to the department of justice and the attorney general who leads that department to do\nWe talk about opioid abuse we talk about just the the impact of crime in our communities that's what I Want my attorney general as you are to do and for for Josh call I don't even think he gets the job\nJust fall why should people be paying attention to this race I should say eighty one percent at this stage less than a month away any one percent did not have an opinion on trial will be on TV soon and very game you're traveling around the state and talking to voters about the issues that are important\nHe doesn't even know\nThe issues that are important because it's just you're talking about have nothing to do with the job of attorney general and that was my crocheting was the monitoring the debate because a fantastic job by the way ah there's a great example of a local journalist who understands the dynamics of what your job entails doesn't get hung up\nOn some of the nonsense doesn't regurgitate talking points in questions what you see a lot uh he he's smarts he's articulate and it gets to the heart of the matter is why I always tuned into 'em I'm Mike Shea moderated debate for Josh call\nThis guy is not somebody you can trust in this important position I think about what's happening Wisconsin right now\nOpioids dissent no problem with uh the attorney general talked with us about last week\nCrime in our cities\nSee a school safety what's Josh call going to do about any of those issues he's the guy that talks about Donald Trump and passing legislation\nAnd he does about enforcement which I think is is at least the leadership of the ... law enforcement community is what the job entails so you have to give them a failing grade on understanding the one the job you're running for two\nSeemingly lack of a commitment to actually live in a state that you're going to represent or at least try to represent\nWhat was the uh the the the number of thrown out four years of his adult life spend Wisconsin does that suggest somebody that's in touch and and I mentioned it to James which is an early in the show Democrats throwing up these candidates strictly to put somebody up for a raise\nBut I'm no direct connection to the states have barely been here don't know the voters and in this case Josh call don't even know the job they're running for so\nScared me with that Jordan [laughter] so you gotta you gotta\nWonder about the uh the Josh call a race but uh I I think of all the races that I talk about on the show I think the attorney general Brad channels in the best position but you know there's no guarantees as we're us when we speak you know to

Know Democrats are excited supposedly\nThey see this more as a referendum on Donald Trump because frankly beyond that most of the candidates they have running don't really have platforms that are that

there are other branches in a way and they they were the branches of trees on his neighbor's property than ever being caffeine make well he helped himself to trimming her own trees\nUm I guess maybe it's not easy to explain afterwards them to ask permission but he did this opening up his view of course but an irritating his neighbor\nThey went back and forth on this or he pleaded guilty he being

shows the neighborhood because of the location the amazing view regretfully the priority of our view overtook the higher priority of ... neighborly mess in the situation and we Ciruli apologize for this we would like to see a new beginning to our relationship and ask for forgiveness\n[noise] well what happened is there was a lawsuit and that was over trespassing destruction of property them in a couple of other things and it was settled in May of twenty Seventeen and both sides agree to that\nBut that's where it's just kind of interesting because what Cathy lake did it started to plant new trees on her property three pine trees than Eighteen birch trees three more times this is after the\nNine days after the judge dismissed as the suit by both parties agreement\nThat's how this thing escalated again so the Marlins family filed a lawsuit against leg that was in twenty Seventeen and they say like intentionally put the new trees blocking their view like Michigan diminishing the value of their home\nNow that I was about five hundred thousand half a million bucks like someone was about about the same little more than five hundred thousand this new lawsuit contends lakes nutri planting\nAmounts to a spike sense in violation of common law and state statutes another claim says her existing overgrown trees are private nuisance than invade them I was interested in a private use in German other land\nHere's what the law says in Wisconsin any fence hedge or other structure of the nature of offense unnecessarily exceeding succeeding height maliciously erected or maintain for the purpose of annoying the owners rockets joined property shall be deemed a private nuisance\nThat's pretty clear\nAnd while I I agree that the Marlins went too far in their ... their original pruning they settled that lawsuit both parties agreed\nAnd what Cathy lake has done clearly if you if you um read the Wisconsin law and I just did violates my intense the law\nIt also points out loudly and clearly that um neighbors for whatever reason maybe it's the close proximity and although in this area you're not that close\nNeighbors have a hard time getting along and that that hasn't gotten any easier over time as we see people read fences in and do other things that just irritates her neighbors frankly dogs barking as as an irritation\nSo I'm this one I'm gonna I'm going to side with the Marlins fan clearly they overstepped\nBut they settled the lawsuit with their neighbor both sides and agreements nine days after that all these new trees pine trees birch trees started
