O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. word one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the Allen calls him from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\nPartridge or most her to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live out\nAll here he was sure spending that my spirit has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major primaries in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route with with on an on the major three ways but\nThen if you run into a situation where like in a suburb in North Carolina where the courts are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going now go go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you should start on the side roads and says it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh I'm In a state and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side Roach that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what Anthony kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisure early um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to pay back your weight sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people that I meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nBut when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say the ... let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach and we're going to go to\nThrough this direction to that location so this way family members who you rely on\nUs even as the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning the tax bill the email that says once that sour turns on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the your thoughts your or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nAh survey things so wonderful that we know where each of those are like\nYou can set inactivated your GPS for your family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael dust storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers are the people that you're sending a signal to went down ... ...\nThat's single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd on the other side it's important to understand that they will always be the ones of power\nIs connected to that cell phone they will receive the message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you should such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boy had to do with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony kovac good evening Patrick\nA good evening gamble for this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise] um [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script\n[noise] um [noise] hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific could be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter] a wave of [noise] but ah [noise]\nMaybe ah either getting by number\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to get you to know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other him practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and then he\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was so let's say all of this you know in a state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the store and the storm goes towards Alabama or text us\nAbout ... is the state of Florida liable for ... this storm and damaging to states the other states or let's say another guy said let's say the United states there's a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight to the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got to be upset\nYou know and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding a part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn them headed inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so uh the the fact is that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly up\nA lot of it just simply change of course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable ever I mean\nIt could be a painful lesson and be a liability law in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe\nAnd his book is emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family is ... urgency prepping dot Oregon where one eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment\nAttorney Tom Nichols small businesses ...\n[laughter] okay well what other then all of the things you said so far about ... or all of that I was a ... you know what the other day I\nReally there for an old like water to or or a ... year old and not even work because\nYou wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nLet's not that that's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you certainly have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that it's a you know twenty on the Richter scale of every structure and road it's flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's likely undergo kid is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice for a job that you would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean a belt kid is just that so let's say you are you have to abandon your vehicle and you have your whole trunk full adult cats\nWell you have your backpacking you carry ... central stuff a few days the food and lettuce and that other things that you can now walk and hide it to the next town or wherever it is that you have safe lodging or maybe even just they just sent nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know ... start putting together what's happening now think about it it was the last part retain that case of farming laws of the face now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation\nLike in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back the facts\nThey take it seriously the money and management of each county each district each wage in the state itself\nI mean we ...

all kinds of money things out there it's a major part of the of our lives even if I\nMay be investing or or playing a various a market games or or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we are all our economic beings to what extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's money has was mad but Steven Chu goals and from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim uh or remember one night a night\nOf very for those who do knows even news in the same year that I was in in in Vietnam but to go ahead\nYeah but you are awesome for\nAn either or I was I was actually listed also but anyway what do you have it for what do you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold but it's always been for me I'm a Seventy year old and uh I\nUh it's always been holders value for me uh it's it's really a\nStay the same market terrier ate it in the last year I was wanting to know if it if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down after many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even more lower them out so I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold has not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything good currents become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of some insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same Silver's ... gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a a a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker wait wait don't none of the Russian smells have really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well\nNow a this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example that a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing that that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up ah but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when it looked like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just them during well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the founders arms race rates are loud and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent it\nStarted about two point one percent sort of had a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut ... do you see a interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bomb interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's got up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just to have a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not an empire for political reasons another way to get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bonds sixty billion a month for the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the deficit that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars need that just that corner around\nToday there are options of the thirty about the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and we don't go up and prices go down\nThen there you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a break\nA very close look at the gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness what eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas

in giving back to the humidity that's why I'm a dedicated blood donor I own a negative light\nOf the percentage of people that are given major who within twelve months of graduation are actually working in that field at work\nJust to the gym is twenty seven percent of the people who graduate ended up using something it remains their major twenty seven percent meaning Seventy five percent are three quarters do not end up working in in their major field in one way or the other\nWay they would have to you you essentially a ... from a financial point of view you've you've wasted your time you've acquired I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby\nI'd say that uh I'll be happy to literature I always say well okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying out this kind of enormous money\nTo finance the hobby added but I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who could make a living in the professional bowling to her doctor at so I mean it it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and then he tried to get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs are unfilled\nEmployers cannot find the people\nTo do two of them die making are plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college I don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your butt in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you have a law student loans you are under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs that are like but they've got services you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't service in student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of a

S. thing\nIf prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon they do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nUh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier\n... for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\nPerkins ... who paid and opposition research from\n... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting on verified salacious allegations against Donald Trump that they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will and both his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n... really know\nThe average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine or after the lawyer said\nHis client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firms represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nFusion fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course all or is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't I don't write are are they going to ask him about a a who\nHe believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nI I don't think so what are they going to ask him but I finally I was I going to ask him about Kanye West probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their\nRole or\nIn the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have than access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still there is spectra general gets them for the asking\nA does see oh he ... he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and and again if\nThe those are the ... that's a number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because through the GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut how so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with um you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they\nWere on a those devices if they're still preserved\nIn any way we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand them what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about it they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer than\nWhat do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the Mueller investigation is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't\nKnow what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committed any crimes\nI don't know what I don't know where there was any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money for ... third opposition research firm that just on the level is is that's what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite while the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what is he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell and then finding the time it was interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under oh I'll just there are plenty of people that do wonder oh mhm so what is the crime that he is more than that what is the charge\nThat's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years we've been saluting

this\nBut it's part of our culture which part you know in an innocent until proven guilty that evidence decides that something that's even beyond what we're taught about the infrastructure of how the constitution works that's part of our popular culture each in\nSo many TV shows out there over the last forty or fifty years and I think they just that it was a huge mistake and calculation by the Democrats to believe that they could sell that\nTo the American people 'cause I guarantee you if you're a Democrat out here right now you know mhm\nThat that was a stupid move by them\nRight that if they want to go post Kavanaugh opposes cabin off but coming out with those statements that a woman is always to be believed everyone knows is pure trash yes nobody is to always be believed just because of\nTheir demographic their gender or race whatever everybody knows it's the evidence but they actually tried to sell that to the American\nUh uh the people and you think about it's just it's just it's nuts and then by the time we got to the middle of the week it was the Democrats promoting instability including the mainstream\nOf the the Democratic Party or like a Hillary Clinton or we saw Eric Holder come out than backtrack or everybody knows that's not what I meant somebody wrote that don't use the word kick\nAnd you know to you know where we are uh you know right now looking at the polls and seeing how they're all going to react\nMhm [noise] yeah and it is it and it is also the wagging of the finger toward people simply for believing in the process there they're being a indirectly condemned for doing so I'm just\nSaying that you're essentially on a person's side and that you support what we alleged she did\nWrite your it which goes against it and think about it I I think the perfect example the perfect image reaches the ACLU what they used to be used as to what they have become today that the presumption of innocence means\nNothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore it shows used something accord with Americans understand and the ACLU probably did decades of of of damage a Jew themselves by saying that doesn't matter that the allegation matters by taking a side instead of defending the constitution\nAnd that's when it gets down to and so like I said it's going to be really interesting to see what happens but it's amazing what the Democrats have tried to sell this week instability and due process means nothing right wow mhm eight six six Ninety red eye\nThe latest consumer price index shows no change for what we pay for food at

[noise] wow [noise] the video that came out yesterday or against\nA Kirsten Sinema yeah or the speech he made and\nBut in the hour what she actually said part of the Senate race there and and writers on well some of the quotes on that a good news is a Dow futures up ... of the president's dating yesterday that\nThat uh the plans are meeting with China again yeah and uh hopefully that's what this is helping the bounce back up because we looked at the bad news over the last couple of days with the fed dropping Thirteen hundred and we said there's nothing you can do and I think the president can do to stop\nBut the fact is going to do or not you're not going to stop it nothing they can do to stop the borrowing or the interest on the bonds ... there's a ... on the regulation of tack that's more of a Congress thing\nWhat can the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and he said we're going to you know meet a yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that the stock market is tempered today is the hope that a a deal is going to be done yep yep\nYeah 'cause you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people losing confidence in those companies that are issuing concerns over those raw materials especially but terrorists overall we'll see what happens with China for on the trucks here's your forecast\nThere's been a big drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of fever in western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow rain line is set up for the early morning hours and we will see rain pushed to the east\nIs to work in the Senate ... the the United States Senate and represent the people of Arizona just uh just for starters don't call the people of that state crazy\nYou know in a time she focused in on the Republicans but at the time she did not when she ... craze shores\nSo as soon as she because she's probably going to say well Republicans are crazy but she's problem that that might be how she defends himself\nWhich by the way well she does well that would hurt her because she was trying to position herself as somebody who was ... so just assume\nThat okay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to the left they didn't move to the right to be clear\nBut ah they on that on\nOn that point she is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supported the John McCain right\nYeah I looked up Cuomo can get away with saying\nConservatives are welcome in New York right yes even the ones that are there because we know that right and in writing and just being on you get ...\nYou can get away with that New York yeah yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right and\nYou can be a Democrat say look I Know all of people are not everybody here's crazy or not right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nAre remember he said he'd rather than an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in the state yeah that's a huge number of people in New York state death by the by the way\nUm you know this and this is that said that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience ... gun rights it's my rights\n\nUh yeah the guy doesn't ... doesn't that doesn't have any rights that God has no right to John\nDoesn't have any rights I assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers right it's the people's right yes\nA very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nYes and you can come as the design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet but the design I've seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk is even\nBetter than to the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and the gambling city ah for those who don't gamble or never been when you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you could play mhm right\nBy the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you losing video [laughter]\nTo be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything ...\nNow that uh I I just that they don't just buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no I'm\nThe those [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like ... ... ... but but for the bar is they'll move away from ... oh man oh no no no no right now and\nBartenders robot brothels yeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about it we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about and we just last week of well I mean\nYou know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them\nThe coffee vending machine where would make your ... yes yes I was going back to terminate her to\nA security guard making the or it was a ... that went to make a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as teeth to walk up behind him and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics and serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it\nYou know and you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made\nAnd even delivered to you depending\nOn the set up on the counter ... by automation\nYou know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ... caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... a robot is not going to do this well\nEither one but I did here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap or how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to her is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction and wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant\nTrust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can be angry either right MBA an angry bartender right\nOr can't can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] all of them that but how how far do you go with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel now we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk up and the screen has you know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards were animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center\nAnd you don't you're not close to everyone it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right ... well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in ...\nIt's a huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink it's not your pub riding where is that where the bartender right dates to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or uh like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol it'd be interesting to see how far this go\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender\nA year ago when you walk into your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka or whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house\nAnd you say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nThere you go oh and then she hands you affiliates\n[laughter] no [laughter] I got out of high now [laughter] and then it's acceptable alcohol Alexa drinking alcohol [laughter] hey I Want

we're going to be in trouble they also is to take on Los Angeles in game three of the national league championship series and\nUh all season long not polling has worked so hard and covering the team host the course of extra innings the nightly show following every borough broadcast with Bob ... he joins us now good morning Matt\nHey Mark I'm earning a great to hear your voice a love your work every night after the ball games um are your thoughts right now is your inner game three what what kind of strategy do you think ...\nI think we just keep doing what you've been doing a now yesterday was a disappointing loss obviously because they had a lead going into a late innings where those high leverage guys who have been so good all season long couldn't finish it off but I don't think a loss yesterday changes any plan they they won\nTwelve and a row they had the best record in the national league they swept through the division series so I think they're really good shape now are you going to Los Angeles obviously the one thing that does change a little bit if they are not scheduled to play three games without an off day the way they used their pitching the off days have been something that's been really really good for this club\nSo maybe there's a little bit of a change in terms of our liberal they can be\nA with the relief pitchers and games three games for but for the most part I think the the thing is don't change the thing you're doing because what you're doing has really been work\nDoes the national media really understand the brewers strategy or they're still trying to figure it out in your opinion that\nThey're still trying to figure it out and it's it's funny for me because when the season got started and especially the the the one that long and the strategy became more clear what was going on I heard it from it all the time for from listeners so upset about starters not going deep and the games and and the other way that they're\nMixing and matching guys and the the one that long and it was clearly working\nThe brewers fan base I think for the most part starting to understand what was going on and now those exact same people that are up in arms about the fact that the the the national media doesn't completely understand so\nThat's fine I mean they weren't on a Sunday night game all year long they weren't they weren't very few national games in general I get that the national media doesn't understand what what's going on with the brewers side of it\nI don't get why that big of an ill enjoy them winning games enjoy them what they're doing I don't think it's a real big deal that maybe about this or Joe Buck or whatever out there that are completely understand what's\nGoing on fame will meant how evenly matched are these two teams uh you know on paper and from you know from New knowledgeable squads throughout the season I mean this is a battle right\nOh it is it absolutely is is a very evenly matched series and the thing is it's an evenly matched serious were the rafters are very very different so it's not evenly matched in the sense of you know kind of man to man it's evenly matched from twenty five man roster twenty five man roster I mean you look at that\nDodgers lined up and that is a deep of a line up as you're going to find them baseball but then you have the brewers pitch you didn't have the relief fetching and they've got the ability\nTo go out and stymie guy so I think I knew this was going to be an extended period I absolutely still believe that this is going to be a six or seven game series I'm not sure it's going to end up wanting it but in terms of an evenly matched competitive series very much so and I love I Love the fact that they are two\nDifferent styles to go along with the fact that I think they are evenly\nMatched okay you have spent a lot of time with the ball players are different levels of the organization uh what's the thought process now you're tied one to one you're going to the west coast\nYou know he got a lot of fans support back home but in terms of just making that transition to the other ballpark to the west coast you're in a different atmosphere what's going through the brewery minds right now\nThey're really good road team they've been a good road team all season long and that's been consistent for the beginning it took them a little while to kind of find their uh their mo Jo at home they have been a good road team\nSince season got started so I don't think anything changes they're either they're going to go in and play their game uh I I don't think Dodger Stadium is the place that's overly intimidating kind of place but I'm the team would get intimidated\nNo matter where they're playing I mean look at where the celebrations have been this year they celebrated at Busch Stadium there celebrated at Wrigley Field they celebrate at Coors Field so they've they've had a huge wins this year on the road\nAnd if they can go in the ... even if they win just one in Los Angeles than they still get the chance to come back to Milwaukee for game six and seven if they can find a way to win two out at three in Los Angeles they're absolutely in the driver's seat in the series\nReturning or as many as ... this is just so much fun it is\nI and I hope people enjoyed I'll be honest mark I was well at this point last night with some of the responses that I was getting from people on the show yesterday evening because I get the history of the really frustrate loss but at the end of the day I Love this game so much I loved the postseason so much and I really really hope that uh all the fans\nCan enjoy it as well even when he got a tough loss of saying there's nothing wrong with being bummed out about last like yesterday it's still a great time and it's something that I Hope the fans across the border enjoying\nMet poli a wholesome and we broadcast a real extra innings looking forward to your continue work throughout the championship

buyers and potential homebuyers I think both oh yeah Mm Mm 'cause yeah yeah yeah I guess [noise]\nUh and they serve it a thousand want people to get this they do it every month and so this is the September report that just came out in early August so\nDavid a hazard a guess for me what percent of respondents said that now is a good time to buy do you think it's a fifty percent sixty percent or Seventy half fifty\nFifty eight percent say it's a good time to buy and that's a up slightly from last month put down for march one sixty two percent said it was returned to buy\n'em thirty two percent say it's not a good time to buy two isn't that interesting that you know some people had to come up here isn't the current national homeownership rate floating around ... percent something like that so amazing how that similar and so with Fannie Mae does in building this indexes they look at the difference\nSo the difference between the positive answer and the negative answer is twenty six so they have twenty six and then the next question is\nIs now a good time to sell\nAll sixty four percent people say it's a good time to sell and only twenty six percent say it's a bad time to sell and this is all relative to your perspective you've ever read your kept wings story about the five blind men feeling an elephant [noise]\nYou know one one said oh this thing is like a story is feeling the task and the other felt the leg and said it was like a tree trunk and another one felt the ear and said it was like a great palm tree blah blah blah [noise]\nAlso depends on your perspective so nobody's going to line up the same All right I'm respondents who say home prices will go up in the next twelve months forty nine percent\nProbably ten percent say it's going to go down All right so this is your positive differential thirty noticed sentiment that how do you feel today ... index right because the government does the same thing on inflation by the way because it's more what people think is going to happen with\nPrices of consumer goods is almost as important as what actually happens move 'cause that's what people think informs her behavior and write a response you say mortgage rates will go up in the next twelve months well people are in touch with reality\nUh that's sixty percent um go down as only four percent sure those people are dreaming hold a yeah hold non embassy never know [noise]\nUm so that's a negative fifty six point one of my people who are on their job because ... security if you and your job is a big indicator um are you concerned about losing your job but the next four months not concerned is eighty nine percent only ten percent of the people are concerned about losing their job okay so that's a big positive\nAh what about um who see their household income is significantly higher\nThan twelve months ago twenty eight percent say that significantly lower is only nine percent so that's a Nineteen points for it to the good so ah people feel good\nYeah yeah people are positive ... so you add it all up blah blah blah blah blah\nIt comes to the sentiment index of eighty seven point seven\nWhich is down just a frog here from a month ago but to put it in perspective way back in two thousand eleven in the steel grip of the housing crisis\nThis index was only sixty so so it's up significantly from that and it's been kind of

equity no\nIndeed and and I hope that ray is still listening and reading was the first time homebuyer who called in is talking about what size down payment should he make\nAnd so this is kind of really the same topic so I had this conversation yesterday with a friend and and repeat customer of mine whom we provided to whom we provided an amazing\nFifteen year fixed rate refinanced to back in two thousand twelve at yes this is a real rate from back then folks to two point eight Seventy five percent we're going to two hundred and fourteen thousand dollars at the time in his home at that time or six years go craze for three hundred and thirty five thousand dollars\nJust as a point the fact that we're gonna come back to the thirty year fixed rate at that time would have been three and a half percent uh and that payment would have been five hundred dollars less per\nOf his monthly fourteen hundred and sixty five dollar payment is going towards principle written about eleven hundred dollars in the X years time you've knocked off Seventy thousand dollars or so they're really terrific news for a this a couple\nIs that they have reduced their principal balanced by an amazing Seventy two thousand dollar got a ton of equity here down to a hundred and forty two thousand and only nine years left to go and their their mid fifties so by the time it gets your typical retirement of age they will on this home free and clear which is kind of cool and that will\nThe secret weapon they're you know why people do this is then that will free up fourteen hundred and sixty five dollars you know in their monthly budget that they want us to be showing out [noise]\nUm [noise] the other true thing is that their houses probably gone up about sixty thousand dollars in value so they have gained a sixty percent a hundred and thirty two thousand dollars of equity in this house David you have a calculator I was just\nPutting on my financial advisor head when you reduce your budget by fourteen hundred dollars per month that means you do not need three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to kick out five percent yield every year\nOh she can reduce your savings All right so here's a question for me because now\nYou know back when we did the lawn and two thousand twelve his two children were in high school and middle school and now they're in college and is that costs money that costs money and I was surprised they're going to Wisconsin you know University of Wisconsin schools but it's still twenty grand per child per year\nSo you know that's forty grand a year for the grand a year and ... to their credit they are paying for their children's education\nOut of their current income which is a hefty you know Trump gets a thirty six hundred and sixty six dollars a month and it comes in the lungs but you know now they've got some more time to go on one student than the others so I calculated that they will need sixty four thousand dollars\nUm to fund the rest of the college tuition\nAnd so boil it all down and and and my recommendation was hey I think you should bar keep your two point eight seven five\nFirst mortgage 'cause that's the biggest chunk of money yeah it's right and then go out and borrow sixty four thousand right now I Am borrow it All right now cause rates are probably going to go up and I found them a second mortgage fixed for Twenty years at four point eight four percent that's gonna have a payment I think four hundred and forty dollars a month\nSo instead of ... kind of struggling really I mean 'cause that's a lot of money\nTo scrimp and saving kick out of your monthly budget on average thirty six hundred bucks a month\nFor all the money right now about ... on a fixed rate second mortgage and instead of having to find thirty six hundred dollars a month now you only have to pay four hundred and forty dollars a month David I think I did this red in his blended rate yeah across those three and a half is yes that's exactly what I came okay\nSo um you know and then I went back and I was playing Monday morning quarterback and I are thinking well should he have taken the thirty year fixed rate you know back in two thousand twelve thousand twelve [noise]\nUh yeah the pain would have been five hundred dollars less if you save all that money you come up with thirty six thousand dollars out of Beckley outside in order to match\nThe equity that he's gotten the Fifteen year blah blah blah blah blah he would have had to have gotten a ten percent return Tom powder Daniel growth rate which is lofty right I think most financial advisors maybe you can count on six or seven\nSo ten but it turns out you know in hindsight is twenty twenty right the standard and Poor's compound annual growth rate\nFrom two thousand twelve to right now is Fifteen point three mhm if he so he would have come out ahead but not knowing that back in two thousand twelve I think that I think he ended up\nHe buys hers and not WGM Jay

conversations is former Milwaukee near John Norquist among the many things he did during his sixteen years in city hall he took up the party's freeway spring which opened up a lot of downtown land for development looting the space for Pfizer form now since\nWe talked to this started about the skyline in one of your signature accomplishments toward changing that skyline changing Milwaukee certainly changing downtown was the demolition of the party's freeway and of took a while to get that project moving after this this man came down but would you agree that that's number one on your list of things you did\nYeah I guess it's the one of one of the important things are no freeways don't belong in cities are in big cities they they um\nIn Europe most of the big cities don't have freeways at all terrorists doesn't have any they had one little freeway that\nWas built in the Nineteen seventies that just eliminated it last year the freeways are world thing it's about moving from point a to point B and pushing as much traffic along the road as you can\nIn a city it's the network of streets along with the transfer some complexity of the city in the city ... economy and culture is very complex and so it's the network make things work not trying to run everything through one road\nAnd that's why freeways don't work very well when you need 'em animals that Russia or are they ... they tend to slow down or even come to a standstill they were great at two AM you can drive eighty miles an hour to the city is loose as long as the cops\nCapture me Dr Ballard and [laughter] [noise] but uh you know you can't drive real fast that Russia\nBut you're actually better off with a network the streets so if you take for example Vancouver British Columbia they don't have any freeways at all within the entire city it's a city of about six hundred and fifty seven hundred thousand people they have a network of streets that are handled the traffic you have a\nA good transit system is have you had as the best real estate appreciation of an email as North American city ... over the last Thirty years\nOr ... you know a lot of people want to live there you take the places where they focus on a\nCar traffic as a member one priority those cities usually aren't doing too well and I'm really proud that when I was in the legislature we stopped about half of their freelancer there wanted to build a Milwaukee if they build them all Milwaukee will probably have maybe three hundred and fifty or four hundred thousand people instead of six hundred thousand people\nAnd it would be a smaller version of Detroit\nSo you know the freeways didn't do any good for Milwaukee at all my uh you you go to Germany you go to Denmark sweet and you look at Canadian cities like ... they don't have any freeways and ... million people to prosper city\nA property values are good uh it doesn't solve all proud of you know it doesn't solve cancer and bad breath\n[laughter] sure if it's just a complete waste the money to spend all the money on the freeways and\nSort of taking out one in Milwaukee and see what happened the property values around it went up eventually once the county\nStuff to you know putting all kinds of restrictions on the land the land to the county own one of the freeways gradually filling up city land filled up right away and they use we didn't put restrictions on\nRight as I remember you had when Eisenhower the father of the the uh American interstate ... the biggest backer of getting an interstate system going he was inspired by the auto about in Europe and and it broke his heart I heard later on to find out that indeed freeways were run right through the middle of us city\nYeah he actually when it was signed by the\nWayside their state activity noted that it would probably kill passenger railroads\nSystems and all that at that point although railroad for private I mean the passion or trains they were paying taxes\nTo government just like Milwaukee's transit system you have the street car company and the interview insists and they're all paying property taxes and meanwhile the government's raising money and then spending it on the roads like crazy\nSo uh when you have the government pushing roads and taxing transferred that's what happened in the Milwaukee we had three hundred and fifty miles of street car at the end of World War two and almost two hundred miles of in urban trains that went out to walk on a beach and ... they went to\n... ... go\nWe're seeing you know that was all good stuff than it used to walk it probably today would be a much bigger more prosperous place it's a transfer they'd been retained instead of a building our freeways\nWe are we are getting the streetcar back this fall what do you think\nOh it's a good start I'm In Dallas at a street curb a twenty five years ago and now everybody said laughter poop crude or you had\nNo people saying well don't spend money on that spend money on this you know whatever\nBut you know compared to building street some giant loads and all that stuff it's not that expensive and it's a start now Dallas has about a hundred miles of a light rail which is basically the same thing or a streetcar\nSo that the streetcar line they built in Dallas or let people realize that it it wasn't you know the end of civilization if you had a strike [laughter] you know I think it all\nI think it'll be fine it it's a it's a start middle sporadic I think it'll be like in Kansas City now they're very happy that they did it was a lot of ridicule the legislature in Missouri tried to block it\nBut it's really helped downtown Kansas City and nearby neighborhoods they're not planning other lines so yeah I think it'll work out sorry\nWhy do you think so many people push back against\nAny it's because it's visible uh I think you know if it's ... or something new that's always going to attract a certain amount of opposition several that's healthy ... minutes that people shouldn't be expected to salute something if they don't understand it\nSo I don't think people should get all upset at people to complain about\nStuff that comes along it deserves to be tested in

don't know what the problem is but they're raising interest rates and it's ridiculous\nPresident said he's not happy about he also said the fed is out of control so what's he going to do about it\nA lot of people on Wall street and academia and elsewhere in the press are talking about uh interest rates the speed of the increase in whether it will impact the economy it's a legitimate fear that I Want to add more of a quick way\nI don't personally and the president respects the independence of the fed let me make that very clear\nHe said as much during these comments he is not telling them or mandating them to change their strategy is not found them to change their policy is is raising a very important issue which by the way everybody else in the world is also raising I Do think I Want to say this\nPretty much everybody believes that we want this economic boom which virtually no one expected we want this boom to continue were running for the same objective\nThere are issues in discussions within that but president again let me say this has never interfered with that independence is that so\nWhat is the biggest threat though to that continued economic growth a lot of people have been citing a the president's focus on terrorists particularly with the Chinese as something that could stall this economic momentum right now\nWhy the traitor she let me just add one point out the biggest threat to this economic boom which in my view is going to go on for several more years\nIs efforts by the Congress to overturn it\nAnd I think that's an election year thing we do not want to overturn the a reduction in tax rates for individuals and small businesses and so forth we do not want to overturn all the across the board deregulation which has unlocked and release the animal spirits\nAre the new Trump autonomy is about blue collar workers it's also about men and women who own their own small business is\nThe president has ended the war against businesses excess my biggest concern is that a political issues are congressional issues could overturn these important pro rose measures that to me is the biggest issue is\nOne of the things you can talk about the progress measures including the tax cut you predicted before the attack that was that that was going to bring down the deficit in fact a deficit it's been going up our debt is higher than ever\nWell actually you know it just got the numbers on a a deficit for twenty Eighteen um\nThey came in over a hundred billion dollars below estimate according to the congressional budget office there is still ... million dollars I Believe George was about three point nine percent of GDP which is a manageable number now look\nA short run they're all going to be is a deficit issues medium term and I think the median terms coming on\nFaster economic growth or which will bring in a more people working a more revenues a faster economic growth that's going to really lower the budget deficit and his burden on the economy I think that's absolutely\nFashion isn't taken a right now you're going to have irreversible damage\nIs much much sooner and then in the next Twenty years and of course it comes against the backdrop of that horrific hurricane we just saw hurricane Michael you can't tie any single weather event\nTo climate change but there's there's little question among scientists that it's increasing the light the probability of more intense weather events warmer water leads to more intense weather is a president going to do anything about it\nWell look we're always studying these things I mean he had um\nI guess still north house for me I've got a Nobel Prize on his own economic where it goes back to climate change I respect that is really a brilliant guy the issue here though is magnets chosen timing uh\nPersonally I think the UN study um is it over with the way way too difficult um I won't say it's a scare tactic but I think they overestimate\nThese models have not been very successful um the last Twenty years and we have to be cognizant of the work that needs to be gone I I'm not denying a any climate change issues George I'm just saying do we know precisely and I made worse modeling\nThings like how much of it is man made how much a bit of solar how much of it as oceanic how much of it as rain forest and other issues I think we're still exploring all of that I don't think we should tax\nAre so I I think the Republicans need to provide that check a box for our system of government does\nA and I hope that they can without a change and then uh and and who controls Congress but I think that that may become a nephew believe a conventional wisdom that I got to do the house will likely flip Senate will remain in Republican hands\nJeff Flake pastry time

into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example uh that that they were having really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues\nWe have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault um once you had to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political

hour and a thought that the mirror neurons that compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a CAT scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle urine mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know is going to affect you because you're an impasse how'd it begins to those boundaries\nWell one thing I'd suggest all light and pat patients has to take notice fast you know not become addicted to the news because if you had that constant onslaught of stress a negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature or\nMeditate exercise with a friend and laugh so that's one tool but also just notice past traumas a\nTrigger for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident no your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know the different\nThough 'cause they could make a big difference and do that you know I'm dealing with this in

destinations and as anyone buying paper newspapers or magazines\nI think at a typical news than they might be selling about five to ten newspapers a day for someone to find them but not very many people and this is down from even you know ten years ago they might have sold several hundred newspapers and back in the fifties they might have felt thousands of newspapers\nWhat kinds of products have come in to take the place of newspapers and magazines\n... what kind of Packard this a column for me as I was in times square and my phone had died if I needed something to read it I went to I
