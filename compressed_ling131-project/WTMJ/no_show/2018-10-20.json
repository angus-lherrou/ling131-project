Jessica west bend native Mike Frank's from Mac one now both of them in New York\nLiving there and working there during the attacks they mentioned several times and this was not a question that I asked them what they both brought up first responders several times and you heard that year and that is part of this nine eleven memorial so we talked about raising the beam it's more than\nThose who are lost that day it's more than the ground zero folks who set in spent time there and then later last year by from the health ramifications is more than just the U.S military\nThat enlisted after the fact after nine eleven were inspired by nine eleven and decided to go and then give the ultimate sacrifice like some of them did it's also\nThose first responders it's the firefighters the police officers who were there he said if they were standing post she's running like mad to get out of their ... and those costs are standing there go this way go this way go go go just telling them to get out of dodge and they're running toward the building I mean that that\nThese are these are moments in our history that we need to continue to share continue to tell other people about and that's why this memorial is so important if we raise the beam\nFuture generations including the young generation that currently is here with us can learn more about this and see what actually happened that day\nThat's what I Love about this this effort it it kind of combines all of these different areas of the story right to education piece the history lesson that we're getting from this just hearing from those survivors the fact that a teacher on on your however met her parents\nHave worked so hard to kind of keep her memory alive but also to understand there were so many other people affected you talked about veterans yes first responders ... that that piece\nAt first respond herpes\nWhile others were running away they run towards that that is something that so many people don't understand about perjury and think of an impact\nIf you go to this site and you see the piece of steel and you're sitting there in the apathy to they're going to build a new there's a place where you can speak and you hear a Mike Frank's talk or adjust goes in burger talk or you here Julie Andrews sister just talk about what happened when you see it first hand in here at first hand\nThat can add so much

based on your is we'd be bothered by that apparently some are\nI couldn't care less because what does that make\nYou know what why do you care why do people care about what was the brilliant maneuver I'm actually surprised it's never been done before has it has been done before yet but here's the thing\nI think all of us even though we're biases brewers fan credit counseling done it a masterful job with his pitching staff in the series and in the season right it didn't work out for him so well yesterday I mean what else was outstanding but after that not so much you know what\nYou gotta blame the hitters it's you've got a score run into ... ... you can only be counseled playing chess the whole time you have to be able to hit the ball\nWhat about my premise of the two three to set up a business I'm just saying Oh yes I see her to hurt the brewers they're going three games in in LA you know what\nI hear that all the time every year I hear that are on two three do not fair I don't know I think I mean you have to games you know you you finished the series at home or else would you want to be\nYou know bottom line is supposed to weigh in your home playoff game this is these are two home playoff games hopefully starting tomorrow Miller Park yeah you could do I think in hockey they do to to one one one\nYeah it's a lot of travel though yeah unless you're talking about mid west west coast but they do it yeah I suppose that it is rough especially that was the worst part was Thirteen any game\nEarly afternoon game the next in right now there's a killer for the brewers and boy there bat seem like they're retired and whether or not the players are retiring\nOr give me started on certain because [laughter]\nAlright number one in four I'd send the four biggest stories as we see the cross in wanting to stay in the world coming up next Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker joins us live right here they'll be GM's in Tennessee was Thursday we're now joined by Wisconsin outstanding Governor Scott Walker good morning\nHey good morning great to be what ...\nSo I'm going to ask you before it gets into politics just brewers thing isn't as somebody who's running for office running for reelection does that get in a way or do you does it kind of adds to the experience when you talk to all the focus on what's going to it's hard\nTo make that fine makes it enjoyable you know when I travel or even if it's during a give and we got it on the radio we we heard yesterday I was in the event that ended up\nOn my phone checking the score give people updates as I was talking because it was obviously in an earlier gamut here and that's a lot of fun and it gives me an excuse to dress down and whenever you're all the time so I'm looking back\nAlthough I don't know that can get away with it tomorrow that to me that debate\nThrown at at eight I may have half the moderator to give us an occasional update out of the ...\nYeah most people will be watching the game and probably if if anything taping or so or anything I say about the birds were probably already know by the time they want you\nHow's this uh this reelection been different than last time\nWell just the national climate so much different so you know in two thousand four teen as we did it to the camera can have the windows are are back in and that's not you know a lot of people tied into the current president it's really more just historical I mean when a bomb was the president Republicans did well in the off years\nWhen George Bush was the other way around it it's just part of the historical trends so you're fighting kind of swimming upstream but\nVoters in Wisconsin are smart we've been through a lot ... one of the most engaged electorate\nIn the country and and I believe in the end we get our facts out any more people working this year than ever before um or schools continue to be some of the best of the nation property taxes are down from what we started with a lot of good things happening and I can't imagine that people want to turn back now\nDoes it frustrates you to the ... that the economic prosperity that we've seen in a state law unemployment's companies adding jobs increasing their wages paying bonuses that that doesn't get a a a a hired a space on the front page of newspapers\nOh yeah it's amazing I mean this is one business or has a few\nA few people that get the big deal and and yet I guess that we have ... people employed in the state of Wisconsin than ever before we've already had seven consecutive months of record well when the climate or this year it it's really remarkable and I think the trend is likely to continue again a ... job numbers come out later today\nJust look at all the good things and as I was campaigning with Tommy Thompson the other day you know the great reminder that the naysayers Madison press because of all you've won two thirds at school education and and still make plans are going to cut property taxes\nTommy did it I Know I was there with him I served the legislature and he did it when he was governor we just made historic investments in schools and still got property taxes in fact\nSometimes it amazes me that Tony Evers called my kid my budget approach kid budget he said his priorities went along with our parties\nOr at least that's what he said when he was running for a third term state superintendent nice says something a little bit different but I guess that's 'cause he's running for different office but the facts haven't changed good physical management a major reforms that have saved schools more than three billion dollars in state and local governments more than five billion dollars\nAnd a and helping the people at the state or the job critics crepe more jobs more opportunities it's been good for the state will be if we can get moving for\nTalking to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker preexisting conditions and has been a one of those topics things has shown up in a lot of TV ads set the record straight on ... where are you on that\nYeah see that's a great question 'cause it I Want to be clear we can protect people with preexisting conditions state and a half to protect the failure that as Obamacare it and it's a naturally coordinated effort where they try to tired to to get it that's just not the case and Wisconsin today\nEveryone living at the pre existing conditions covered governor will they will be like a lot of families it's personal to me a lot of your listeners right now can relate to this my uh my wife is a type ... diabetic and that's the type ... diabetic my mom\nIs a cancer survivor she overcame breast cancer and my brother David my younger brother has a heart condition so we know what it's like they have pre existing conditions\nFor us it's personnel in for a lot of famous across the state will always cover people with preexisting conditions in the state the reason they want to talk about that and several volunteers Obamacare separate from pre existing conditions\nOr it's really failing in our state this year when the barbecue exchanges premiums were growing up forty four percent of the energy market\nUh I remember talking to a woman and it just in the Green Bay area who said it in her situation Christine told me that her plans are going up by almost two thousand dollars a month\nThat's not acceptable and so we couldn't wait any longer for washing the fix it\nOnly took action here our healthcare stability plan got both Democrat Republican votes I find that the law the Trump Administration decided off at the girl was last week where it came out the plane it will be down this coming year starting in January by more than four percent\nThat will be ten percent lower than wherever they were headed at the savings and almost a thousand dollars have premiums compare that to my opponent Tony Evers wants to do or he wants to do it Minnesota originally did and when they did that their payments what two years ago this month Mark Dayton governor of Minnesota Democrat said in October twenty sixteen he\nSaid the Affordable CARE Act is no longer affordable that's\nCause premiums in his state we are going up by as much as sixty seven or eight now since then done what we're doing and that causes this year in twenty eight team they're paying us to come down our premiums go down a choices who grew up it will be good for health care is a clear contrast the people need to cut through all the notch effect I encourage people to go to\nIf you're on Twitter going to act Scott Walker go to like Facebook site or just go to ... dot com it'd be connected I was amazed you know Steve on Monday\nI get a short video like twenty two seconds on our uh on the bus we're traveling around what to beat up on me and I can't pay\nTwenty two seconds I said central it I just sit there a moment ago I thought ... thousand people look at it we're now up to over six hundred thousand years of that one little video shot on an iPhone because people are hungry for the troops they want to hear directly for me and I encourage people to go see it\nIn and if you see it pass on other people who may be up in the air because of all these attack ads\nWe got a couple of minutes left with Governor Scott Walker wanted to ask you about Kimberly Clark what are you saying that conservatives and there are a lot of them said government shouldn't pick winners and losers\nWide I get respect that you know what we tried to do is create a better climate why more people working in a safe than ever before its oil or tax cuts have been across the board is why we cut taxes by ... eight billion dollars\nRained in the out of control regulatory environment so that what we're we're doing is protecting public health and public safety you pulled back and frivolous lawsuits improved our workforce\nBut I Believe on occasion there are situations where you get major industries where there was bringing Foxconn like high tech advance manufacture this case protecting a core industry is far more it's not a paper do it's actually a place where they do cutting edge consumer ...\nHigh tech advanced manufacturing or this case protect their core industry is far more it's not a paper do it's actually a place where they do cutting edge consumer products there it's just such a big industry that affects not only five hundred people and five hundred families and the five cities but their suppliers almost two hundred suppliers across the state\nAnd this is just one of those court history we believe ... ... to keep it protect here in the state of Wisconsin we're not doing that for every situation there are others like bon pan and you know I feel bad for them housing but that was a national issue wasn't of within the state is you\nKnow people are looking up jobs all over the place 'cause we literally have jobs and we are unemployed people to fill them I Know\nLast thing is our transportation you your opponents trying to get your heart on transportation what do you how do you respond to that you're you're driving all over the states you're on those roads how do you respond to what Tony reasons and we have\nGood roads in the states and I hear that from people all the time is I don't know what the heck are talking about are the group trying to these attack ads are groups and make big money off of major interchangeable archaea and it was right over the last decade target you know we just finished off the court as you want to change the brood aren't as murder change\nSix at six thirty the live radio play ... will be recorded in front of a studio audience and you can be a part of it my tickets now going to WGM dot com or text or Christmas two for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nYou want to be there it is a blast as there are a lot of surprise guess I was in ... I was part of the last year as a newbie here WGM Jay ... is a lot of fun so join us I've turned her hall\nOr for the folks who can't make it also be rebroadcast regularly TMZ throughout the holidays so kind of a fun way to uh listen to our annual tribute to Christmas and the holidays\nAlright Facebook I've talked about this subject before but um as as the midterm elections get closer\nAnd what are we remember about twenty sixteen Facebook was accused\nOf participating in a scheme by people that weren't in the United states of a priority as opposed to try to influence our election and twenty sixteen her presidential election\nNow\nCEO of Facebook the creator of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg at the time said it was crazy\nBut as we know that story develops to the point where they now know we now know that thousands of ads\nPromoting false storylines force false information replaced by Russian agents ... eventually Saturday that he would make it his personal challenge to fix them\nWell one of the ways they approached that is with something called their war room it's been one piece of this big ongoing project to kind of fix this issue\nAnd it uses a lot of the artificial intelligence systems are facing Facebook has been using to help identify what's authentic and what the actual user behavior\nAnd then they they use this war room and they'd give other people look at this thing as we approach November sex\nTheir director elections and civic engagement ah so there is no substitute for physical real world interaction the primary thing that I've learned is just how effective it is that people in the same room altogether so they're going to look at the activity on their platform as it leads up to November six\nYou know twenty different teams of employees and twenty thousand people mostly independent contractors they've hired\nWhose sole purpose is to block fake accounts fictional news\nCurtailing other efforts on Facebook related to the election\nNot\nFacebook to me has always seemed like one of those incredible stories of incredible successive incredible wealth that seems like it's run out of our garage somewhere in California\nWith hardly any oversight although they have thousands of employees because I I see Facebook I see it every day and I see how people interact with it I see some nonsense that's on there and it does give you pause to think\nOur people trying to influence votes now I I I start with this though\nIf you're dumb enough to be influenced by a Facebook post\nTo have that influence how you vote in election that's on you I Can't imagine what somebody could put in a Facebook post that would make me think you know I'm I've always supported this candidate because of that Facebook posts I'm going to change directions completely switched parties and look for somebody you\nKnow I Know someone that is more nuanced than that\nBut let's be real\nSome sectors weighing in um I Will never trust Google Twitter or Facebook one iota even if they're replaced all their workers with nuns from ... kind of a interesting take their um it's an incredibly successful social media platforms and I ... I've said many times\nIf I look to Twitter for news and information I look to to Facebook to see how my friends and family are doing and my neighbors because that's where I find that out that information more so than living in the same neighborhood or being in the same family up to ... minutes accounts of where they're at what the kitchen or on\nThat's how I use Facebook to think that some people look at Facebook as a source for political information seems crazy to me\nOne of the members of a a a blackout leading up to the twenty Eighteen the terms of twenty twenty presidential election that's not going to happen\nBut maybe you should impose your own blackout maybe you should be more discerning consumer of information it is what it is you want to see cat pictures you want to see what your neighbors vacation look like go to Facebook for that all the other stuff\nThe fake ads\nThe ads for things you'll never buy\n\nIt doesn't seem to me like a source of of solid good information but I I applaud that for at least making the efforts\nBut again if you're dumb enough to be influenced by Facebook come on people you got to be smarter than that especially in the current climate of politics after the break is kicking off this week the Milwaukee film festival\nGood news for local folks and a big event here in Milwaukee why not necessarily interview teams in\nThe city with you on Thursday so bracing ten fifty three forty degrees at Radio City actually not a\nBad day today sunshine and at least in my neck of the woods and these were listening as always the Milwaukee film festival air kicking off this week big events\nIn the allergy starts tonight it is this attempt annual film festival and something to take ... take heart in and appreciate even if you're not a movie person and don't really care about the festival\nThe way this has grown in what they're trying to do to educating teach young filmmakers is really quite amazing the film festival in Milwaukee is now in the top ten of largest in the country and it took him ten years to get there\nThey have so many local filmmakers local editors producers writers involved in this year one of the films is a documentary about Lance\nSides on you may know that name kept inside John of course Jean Miller did the W. teams it carries with his memorial and the plane being brought up near the airport Jonathan Jackson says yeah there's a documentary of screening especially for he re\nLocal war heroes Finland speed or five job and his story and it's spreading that it's called by Milwaukee ever really excited remarried and the cost of all I Know that screening on Tuesday October twenty third in a main out so the oriental theater it's gonna be a really\nReally special screening at the festival so couldn't be happier if somebody who survived for forty five days without food water and just added an incredible story as he invaded the enemy structure\nThere is a local connection to the story of course as far as she was directed and produced in about ... sister who's been on the air with us a few times is part of that documentary the opening screening tonight it's called science fair and die underneath you see\nNow I just you know what I'm saying it's not part of it on on one of the public stations\nThat was co directed by a Milwaukee woman or be closing the film is also directed by someone from Milwaukee so lots of local filmmakers which I just find very impressive you wouldn't think of Milwaukee in that way and I did learn something\nSo I have you ever been to the oriental theater oh yeah oh yeah so you way back when\nOregon the orders that come out the gamble or didn't would play up on the stage there before the Saturday shows sometimes they play during other ones do but usually it was on the weekends argue with play than it would sink back into the stage and it was always kind of a neat thing that we just unique thing that happened after you were in a theater where earlier this year they took that are getting out\nThe owners of the organ said they needed it took it out so now there is no Oregon's being played and oriental bucks apparently I asked Jonathan about this he says\nThere could be one coming back where we hear Oregon music again at the oriental some day\nApparently I asked Jonathan about this he says there could be one coming back where we hear Oregon music again if the oriental some day\n[laughter] we absolutely well where are you know we all have an announcement during the film festival this year but we're very excited to an hour and the author of securing and Oregon that I'm even more excited about that and the previous on that was out\nWithin that Peter uh that uh the previous one would not actually original to the theater and what we think we got our hands on and I'm about to announce it than Oregon that uh is actually a ridge at all to the theater\nWhen you're going to happen I I Know you know at least something out there for people to be decided about an hour or so you know quite break that one today\nSo there you go in Oregon original to the theater not be announced at some point not during the festival\nI gave it a wow that's that's an incredible story especially if it's if it's a germane to that actual theater that was always a big part of the oriental experience rather than Oregon music that school speaking of organ music have you been following these stories about the Oregon a player at the Dodgers stadium\nThat was more the connection is I Love the music he plays a place called music than kind of more than ... baseball take some risks oh yeah [laughter] yeah he's like all over the place I thought that was really cool that are ... you know his dad would bring them back to Milwaukee's parents' divorce his dad was here\nAnd he go to the old comedy stadium and then the Oregon and listen to all those songs and now he's actually doing that for a living and I just didn't how cool is that yeah absolutely All right well thanks for that story them off your film festival very cool and and I was there was a couple of wild and you're one of the organ was one but to the fact that it's in the top ten now for film festivals\nWas that fruitful I guess but that's not what Robert Mueller was tested investigated\nAnd in fact the end of this which I think it's a it's a pretty likely ... has a pretty high probability of being the case he doesn't find collusion or section of justice a lot of Americans are going to go and say to themselves or others what was the point of is\nThe Manafort's the friends that Papadopoulos is that information could have been glean outside of an investigation of the president and his conduct and his campaign's conduct\nAnd today the search the character of this president's with an investigation that found nothing and this is almost a cliche because I'm ... so many times but the only person that really knows this is Robert Mueller\n\nAll accounts wrapping this investigation up as we head to the new year frankly that's a good thing because if it finds as I think it will but there was no collusion we need to move on business frankly taken up too much airtime too much of the oxygen in the room\nBased on really I think in most cases Democrats wanting something to be their their inability to get over the twenty sixteen presidential election\n\nWhat does our occasional guest on the program Dennis Miller comedian say those are the Democrats have really gotten over that twenty six election you're not handling it very well well they are not look to California for an example of that\nOut of their mind about this president out of their mind in what they're doing to try to bring this president down including the latest fiasco the cabinet nomination\nWherever won states\nMerely acting exclusively to try to take down a president based on what they saw happen in twenty sixteen is that the illusion I Know you can call it that is it the arrangement trumped arrangement syndrome I guess but what it really is\nHis folks wanting something to be the case with\nAll the evidence suggesting that would actually happen we'll find out Robert Mueller will tell us at some point or Rod Rosenstein will tell us at some point what we're looking at here\nBut for all of us I think it's good news of the things can be wrapped up by December at least that's all signs point in that direction that is good news for the state more than ... with you on W. teams are now\nAnnual holiday radio show WGN papers on the night before Christmas sign\nGina

while he's going to finally get his do another guy who grow up watching wrestling on Saturday morning the crush her south Milwaukee was one of the icons of wrestling what was the thing he did he would have the beer keg on his shoulder and you'd be running through town\nHe was fun to watch fun to listen to the city of south Milwaukee then you can remember we we helped with us after we had Chris Smith one of the organizers on the show\nThey are going to now puts a replica of the crush are located after a near their cities train station there on the train station eleventh him off the avenues um honoring this great I kind of south Markey's existence\nOr the ... or a common name and that part of the ... of the area I Know a lot of them\nWhat I Love about this story is it recognizes a local person\nFor a life well lift\nAnd whether you're a wrestling fan or not this is somebody that embrace life had fun gave ... some notoriety and the rest of the world and even beyond that because he was a character unique don't we all love people that are that stand out that uh are interesting\nNot ready to ask you to crush or was one of those people so the folks in South Milwaukee they raised the money I think there are about fifty thousand dollars I talked to marry her books at the uh turned her whole part of the other day he showed up um they raise the money\nHe said all the people were asking where this thing going where's this thing going now they know he sat in a in a Journal Sentinel stories are really really fun way to celebrate our most famous son and I agree with them I'd be

south Markey addition I don't know I'm guessing that's going to be popular I'm guessing a lot of people will travel to south Milwaukee they have their picture taken with the crush you know somebody who is a leader city right next to south walkie when\nPeople come to your city and want to do things on a shop one each want to see what your city is about\nThat doesn't get any better than that and and the the idea that you can uh promote your city have fun and celebrate a great life\nA great human being that I had fun while he was alive for crushing Reggie go south ... south Marky how cool is that and ah I'm happy that we can play at one small part in that story lines with the crush or now has a home her sort of have a home rather in South Milwaukee coming up after\nThe news does age matter especially when you're talking about presidents they just might as I said earlier presidents sixty or Seventy two when he ran for president Donald Trump Hillary Clinton sixty eight\nAs I said earlier presidents\nSixty or Seventy two when he ran for president Donald Trump Hillary Clinton sixty eight year old folks have they been running the show too long before we could take a shot at the world series which unsung hero has the best chance of having to get there John McCarron great magic exploring for thirty four on Wisconsin's afternoon news [noise]\nSee somebody with you on this Thursday temperature keeps going up Jordan I think we gotta we gotta winter of a of of Wisconsin weather day in October I'll take it maybe get the fifty five that would be a comfortable temperature for this time of the year\nI'm One of the taxpayers was chiding me on the a statue apparently it's duck crush or da crush or not the pressure I guess I wasn't saying it right duck pressure playing on the way he said\nAnd also they they asked one of the time she was asked why not a statue for Dick bacon and I I don't know you're probably too young to remember who take baking was Dick thinking it was a guy in Milwaukee I noticed because I Want to you WM\nWho often in the wintertime and the fall and the cold months would be tanning at the lake front was\nThis little swimsuit on with these Big M reflective panels\nTanning and he always had a great time actually ran into him in Daytona Beach Florida I'll tell her story sometime interesting interesting guy was or wasn't a body building for a while anybody my age knows him but I think it passed away a few years ago but that was actually someone at a statue for him and\nHeck why nots as we know what the bronze finds and soon to know about the crush or statue in South Milwaukee these things drop people people is what cities wants to help them do business so smart played myself marketer alright\nI asked the question before the news how old is too old to be president so let's start with the other end of the spectrum\nBefore youngest president you know it is number four\nUlysses S grant he's forty six\nTied with him Bill Clinton I didn't think Bill Clinton was that young but he was forty six years old and he took office or John Kennedy second youngest this I knew forty three years old and the winner of the youngest president ever was Theodore Roosevelt forty two years old\nThinking about that for years later the eighty two\nAre we really getting the best that we need in the most powerful position on the planet and I I think that job still has that distinction\n\nThe thing is there's no way to enforce any of us are not going to say to somebody or Seventy ... you\nCan't run for president voters decide these things they make the determination based on debate performance based on their primary performance getting the the most necessary to get the nomination\nIt always needs to be about the voters this is one of those things it's surprising to me\nBut as we here so much about the young people in this country how they're energized how they want to do things differently the first look at the Democratic list of candidates for twenty twenty has the oldest person has to clear leader\nInvoked any let's go quickly to caffeine mosquitoes aren't W ... good morning Cathy\nHi I'm just wanting to say that the pope

think there's no chance of getting nomination Joe Biden has been through\nAll the issues you've dealt with him as a as a legislator as a vice presidents some of the most significant events of our country in our history\nThat's the reason why he is a serious candidate I don't care how old is I'm not a Democrat but if I was a Democrat I Would take Joe Biden and the second or some of the other folks who are running for office couldn't Kamala Harris Cory Booker they're grandstanding there's\nThere are people whose political ambition is blinding them to the fact of the president's\nIs not there to grandstand president there is there to lead and even the current president for all those folks who say never criticized the current president should take a lesson from Joe Biden at least on

W T. M. J. can questions comments you're going to have those there I'll Try to get to those as I can also text us are calling for one for seven nine nine one six one of the acronym workers talking text line\nSo a couple of things many Machado find ten thousand dollars for running in the first baseman have shoes and you know our game for the you know see us it seems like\nHey Seuss Emanuel chowder of gotten over it because you always have some really strong pointed comments I guess I asked the question is that enough\nIt's not really a fine for a guy like that it's going to make probably what two hundred and fifty million dollars in his next contract that's like meat paying fifty cents [laughter] something [laughter]\nBut they did find him and rather quickly so clearly there is something\nThat uh they didn't like about what happened on the field at Dodger Stadium\nBruce Fleming didn't might get retired and there'll be umpire and that quiet now he was on channel for\nTrying to hurt another individual you ... you could ... it was flagrant and as an official it's your job to protect the other player\nFrom mean says we should have been thrown out here's the thing and and they're coming back to the park for hopefully game six and seven if he does something like that I Would not be shocked if you've got thrown out of the game now he's done several things during the series he's seen as as Christian yellow says to be a dirty player\nWhich is silly because he's a incredibly talented star and major league baseball his arm might be\nOne of the best arms in the shortstop in major league baseball and sometimes it seems like he can padded gloves three times with the ball and still beat the runner by a few stuff you know I mean that's how quick ... and how hard he throws back to first base so clearly a talented player for one for seven nine one six one day I can uh more he's talking talks on the other big conversation I Want to have\nAnd this is this is interesting for a lot of reasons you were you and I were talking during the break\nIf they get to Saturday which is still on if they have to win of course the game tomorrow the start timing this game as H. O. nine local time were\nNine nine east coast six oh nine in the west coast like get that you're you're you're playing to the Dodgers crowd and then you are the leading the series but when I'm when I'm thinking about baseball\nAnd and trying to lure in New viewers new new fans little kids they're not going to be able to stay up so to a you know one in the morning midnight\nAnd ... we'll be midnight before we know who investigate well\nWe've seen even in these two one deems that they've had three two games the games take four hours Fifteen minutes or hours like none of these things are fast and I get there and they were selling their commercials and all that stuff\nOh so that's another one we can kick around what are you thinking about these late start times I don't I'm not a fan of it I understand why they do it's it's about ratings trying to get that that the west coast the audience in to be able to watch after they get home from work which but it's a Saturday\nYeah that's true in in California in the work never stops throwing that there's always rush hours you know twenty four seven to California so just people moving around it's tough to get home so\nUh it's an interesting debates let's go to Brian in Brookfield what do you think Brian\nActing like oh yeah I think ... dirty player and he just wants to win and I think the most I get the bathroom I mean look at\nSomeone like grace Allen from ... either a nominal basketball player but he got suspended for a tribute ... flagrantly infiltrate looking atomic as to who the dominance of my wife's got the one hand that\nYou know people that level of athletic they just have something in their brain that just click and they do whatever it takes to win even though it dirty even though that the fact that the addition\nAlex Rodriguez last night the yesterday afternoon said that he thought he could cost them twenty or thirty million dollars on his contract you buy that\nNot at all like you said in the opening either they get shorter than ... million dollars in a thousand dollar fine that's not even a bottle of champagne\nWhen I go for it I Know do you think the British a big I'm up I'm Glad we didn't\nI don't think they they couldn't afford to thanks for the call Bryan it's an interesting debate because you have the again incredibly talented player who has as as the caller just said to have some of this weird quirk where he likes to do things that the kinda borderline or even ...\nThe challenge of player who has as as the caller just said to have some of this weird quirk where he likes to do things that the kinda borderline or even borderline cross over the line of sportsmanship and and think about it on his on his face value\nHe's trying to some degree to hurt other players yeah the your opponents but does that really the way you want to approach the game maybe it's some of the way he approaches the game from his perspective let's go to John ... morning John\nCorning um I I I think\nWhat we're all of them shot dead ... it was bad it was still play I mean\nIt was like she was trying to show off and say that oh you like to see like he's really good like you know it it doesn't matter what he does all equally if it gets out you know you can show who he is well because I think it was a bad play\nBy hits park or you know shame on them because if we come back ... ... ... the doctors you know ... ... ... well you know you can look back probably\nAt that and then you wonder if things with the college and you wonder if he's going if he carries it on my my uh my inclination is to suggest that he doesn't just always seems to be this is the guy that got on national TV\nBefore game five\nActually might have been before game foreign said I'm running to first base is not his running hard hustling to first base it on his cup of tea this is a major league\nAthletes whose job is to play sports who said that running all the way hard to first base doesn't seem to be something he could indoors so take that for what it's worth let's take a quick break for one for seven nine nine wants to one of the eye can emerge talking text line Facebook dot com slash six twenty there'll be team's questions and comments there as well\nMany shadow was he find enough ten thousand dollars\nA corner and sources of America was the find is that enough what else should happen no matter what channel that's next to Jim Jim\nNinety seven seems to fit with you on this Thursday\nForty one degrees at Radio City thank you for listening as always no matter how you're listening whether it's over the airwaves ... three ton FM love the fact that you're a part of the conversation you can also find us on Facebook dot com slashing funds WGM Jay I'm\nNot even a child and there'll be\nPlenty some sources said he was fined ... uh ten thousand dollars for running into brewers first baseman have says hey you are is that enough what should happen to him got a lot of facts and a lot of calls Jeff from Fox points the only way to stop and do that again is to suspend them yes he sues forgave him but what if you hurt someone else good points\nI'm from the two six to of major league baseball is only going to find a player like that ten thousand which is a quote equivalent to about a dollar out of my paycheck\nThey better be consistent actually when people are running over each other more often\nThat is what I said and and I think what what could happen here\nIs if he does anything else in these next two games I Would not be shocked if he got thrown out of the game jumps are aware of it and they'll be aware of it and we've had at least three instances during this series\nJust the series that point to a guy that seems a little bit out of control so there's there's a lot of potential here for some interesting a dialogue between the brewers and the Dodgers coming up at Miller Park starting tomorrow let's go to Jeff in when you're let me see I'm Jake morning Jeff\nRight next to my car so what would happen here\nYou know the right way to find a way that you're writing covered quite you know I Wonder what I Would feel if somebody tried to get on your\n... your ... I think somebody ought to try and\nIt'll be interesting to see things with the College of somebody retaliate so he got being in the game yesterday a but it wasn't\nEither look at two survivors from our area one of 'em is Jessica Olson burger she was from west bend actually she's very similar to the age of ... and she actually looked for ... after the attacks so were you here from Jessica\nAs this took place and we hear from Mike ... who also was in the Trade Center when the attacks occurred\n\nWhen I think back on it I'm struck by what a beautiful morning it was\nThat was going to work I took the train from Brooklyn to Manhattan\nHad my Starbucks and hand pop out of the subway and walk across the courtyard between the two towers\nI actually had second train very close to the world Trade Center\n[noise]\nShook tremendously I was not too far from the windows pretty quickly this guy was littered with debris [noise]\nIt wasn't until I got out on the street that I realized there was something really wrong\nSomething lights were out in ... she smoked for people everywhere firemen already you know I'm I'm seen when\nThere was a live streaming and panic comes freaking calling on\nThe it hurt plaintiffs building [noise]\nAnd now you really you know I was thinking you know acts in assessing up\nBy the time I got two twenty Syrian Broadway which is about cross town area midtown area of Manhattan I saw large crowds of people looking cell towards the world Trade Center and it\nWas at that which I'm sure that I saw\nFireball [noise]\nI didn't see anything there is just another and loud explosions\nAnd that was probably the scared I was [noise]\nI remember at one point there was a lot of concern about other tall buildings in Manhattan\nAnd where I work is very close to the Empire State building and so there was a lot of panic actually in crafts town midtown area to get away from all\nTall buildings when we did finally get out there was eating and stuff in the street on fire [noise]\nAnd um you know the police were there you know stand post telling us you know which way to run [noise]\n\nA policeman was on the corner and he said\nIf I were you like keep running we have no idea what's going on [noise]\nWe were learning that this was a terrorist attack\nI was in Chinatown when itself [noise]\nJust for people screaming\nYou know people aren't streets looking down there you see the towers\nAnd screaming [noise] I get a job turn around I\n\nSomewhere around Chinatown in which the trains were operating [noise] when I was able to get on to train what I recall was it being sell jam packed with people\nAnd nobody's said a word\nIt was silent [noise]\nMy brother was in New York City top at that point [noise]\nYou know thinking about running from the building and and those guys firemen were passed from to um [noise] I'm standing on corners while they're telling us around [noise] wondering where we're Thomas\nThat day he was dead which is great um selfishly\nBut um that's still\nThe hardest part to try and figure out where he was\nOne of my closest friends style [noise]\nHe was a retired New York city firemen who was working fire safety for World Trade center and I've seen a lot when you know when I was working there John down in the lobby and [noise]\nThey a lot safer to keep it going to evacuate childcare\nYou know didn't [noise] it kind of call from another friend later on Christmas Day I can [noise]\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Brooklyn to get home the ashes piling on the cars and the piling on the street and nobody spoke everybody was into much chat\n[noise] I\nTry I are coming from the south a faint glow of orange light and as it moved closer toward to me\nThat a little bit brighter and a little bit brighter and then I can hear\nA bunch of people around me and it wasn't just a punch it was just the people and you couldn't see them\nAnd they were all cheering and they were all laughing\nBecause at this orange light came closer to all of a\nSeries of merging between outline of the traffic and then you can see\nSay that's telling me she had when they think about it because [noise]\nHa that's selling the highland they provided the ties\nAll those people were out there and see just sharing a higher\n\nYou'd think of all the people that were there that day you know the policemen and environment and that gave their lives are doing their job\nI really do you know wonder why you know\nI was lucky and down you know I think it's accurate and how it relates in how they think they get from a\nReal quick channels you know\nBig fan of the ... manager or a\nNew words of Mike Franks and Jessica or some ... Jessica west bend native Mike Frank's from Mac one now most of them in New York\nLiving there and working there during the attacks they mentioned several times and this was not a question that I asked them what they've both brought up first responders several times when you heard that here and that is part of this nine eleven memorial so when we talk about raising the beam it's more than\nThose who are lost that day it's more than the ground zero folks who sat in spent time there and then later lost their life from the the health ramifications is more than just the U.S military\nThat enlisted after the fact after nine eleven were inspired by nine eleven and decided to go and then give the ultimate sacrifice like some of them did it's also those first responders it's the firefighters the police officers\nWho were there he said if they were standing post he's running like mad to get out of their ... and those costs are standing there go this way go this way go go go just telling them to get out of dodge and they're running toward the building I mean that that's\nThese are these are moments in our history that we need to continue to share continue to tell other people about and that's why this memorial is so important and if we raise the beam\nFuture generations including the young generation that currently is here with us can learn more about this and see what actually happened that day\nThat's what I Love about this this effort it it it kind of combines all of these different areas of the story right the education piece that the history lesson that we're getting from this just hearing from those survivors the fact that a teacher on under however met her parents\nHave worked so hard to kind of keep her memory alive but also to understand there were so many other people affected you talked about veterans yeah first responders and and that that piece that first respond herpes\nWhile others were running away they run towards that that is something that so many people don't understand about Christmas and\nThink of an impact if you go to this site and you see the piece of steel and you're sitting there in the amphitheater they're going to build a new there was a place where you can speak and you hear a Mike Frank Stock or just go with some burger talk or you here Julie Andrews sister just talk about what happened when you see it first standing here at first hand\nThat can add so much more value than just seen it in a textbook to think of it that way so how can folks out there you can go to W. came dot com and help us raised the beam it's phase one of their memorial project\nI'm forty thousand dollar effort so it's it's this is a heavy lift no pun intended a heavy lift to get this beam\nUp in the year so we need your help WGM dot com

to to one one one yeah\nIt's a lot of travel though yeah unless you're talking about mid west west coast but they do it yeah I I suppose that it is rough especially that was the worst part was Thirteen any game early afternoon\nGame the next and right now is a killer for the brewers and boy there ... seem like they were tired of whether or not the players were tired or give me started on certain times [laughter]\nAlright does every one of our for I'd send the four biggest stories as we see the cross Milwaukee to stay in the world coming up next Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker joins us live right here that'd be TMZ succeeding with you I'm Thursday we're now joined by Wisconsin outstanding governor Governor Scott Walker in the morning\nHey good morning right to be with you thanks for him out\nSo I'm going to ask you before we get to the politics just brewers thing isn't as somebody who's running for office running for reelection does that get in a way or do you does it kind of adds to the experience when you talk to all the focus on what's going to call\nIt makes it fine make that enjoyable you know and I travel or even if it's during or after we got it on the radio when her yesterday I was in fact I handed up\nOn my phone checking the score give people updates that I was talking 'cause it was obviously in an earlier in the ... it's a lot of fun and it gives me an excuse to dress down and whenever\nYou're all the time so I'm looking back although I don't know that can get away with it tomorrow that to me that they were on their head at eight I may have [laughter] half the moderator to give us an occasional thing out of the rovers\nYeah most people will be watching the game and probably if if anything taping or so or saying I'd say about the earth or probably already know by the time they want you\nHow's this uh this reelection bid different than last time\nWell just the NAFTA climate so much different so you know in two thousand fourteen as we get a few that terribly can have the windows are back in and that's not you know a lot of people tied into the current president it's really more just historical I mean when a bomb was the president Republicans did well in the off years\nWhen George Bush was the other way around it it's just part of the historical trends so you're fighting kind of your swimming upstream but\nVoters in Wisconsin are smart we've been through our one of the most engaged electric\nIn the country and and I believe in the end we get our facts out more people are working this year than ever before um or schools continue to be some of the best of the nation property taxes are down from where we started with a lot of good things happen again I Can't imagine that people want to turn back now\nDoes it frustrates you that the ... that the economic prosperity that we've seen in the state law unemployment's a company's adding jobs increasing their wages paying bonuses but that doesn't get a ... a hired a space on the front page of newspapers\nOh yeah ... is one business or has a few\nAre fewer people it gets a big deal and and yet I guess that we get our people employed in the state of Wisconsin than ever before we've already had seven consecutive mark that record what when employment or this year it it's really remarkable and I think the trend is likely to continue to get a job numbers come out later today\nYou just look at all the good thing and as I was campaigning with Tommy Thompson the other day you know the great reminder that the naysayers Madison press first of all of you on two thirds of the school education and and still make plans you're going to cut property taxes I mean did it I Know I was there what that might serve the legislature\nAnd he did it when he was governor of we just made historic documents in school and still got property taxes in fact\nSometimes that amazes me that Tony Evers column I get my budget approach kid budget he said there's a primaries were aligned with our parties\nOr at least that's what he said when he was running for a third term estates you're protected and I said something a little bit different but I guess that's because he's running for different office but the fact seven James good fiscal management a major reforms that have saved school more than three billion dollars in state and local governments more than five billion dollars\nAnd a and helping the people the state or the job critics crepe more jobs more opportunities it's been good for the state will be if we get moving for\nTalking to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker preexisting conditions as has been a one of those hot topic things have shown up in a lot of TV ads set the record straight on ... where you're at on that\nYeah see that's a great question 'cause if I Want to be clear we can protect people with preexisting conditions state and\nAnd ... where you're at on that\nYeah see that's a great question because it I Want to be clear we can protect people with preexisting conditions state\nAnd a half to protect the failure that as Obamacare it and it's a naturally coordinated effort where they tried it's hard to to get it that's just not the case and Wisconsin today everyone living with a pre existing conditions coverage because I've governor or they always will be you know like a lot of families at the personal to the\nAudio unless there's right now can relate to this my\nUh my wife is a type ... diabetic tenets of type ... diabetic my mom is a cancer survivor she overcame breast cancer and my brother David my younger brother has a heart condition so we know what it's like they have pre existing conditions\nFor us it's personnel in for a lot of families across the state we were always cover people with preexisting conditions in the state\nThe reason they want to talk about that instead of Obamacare's Obamacare separate from pre existing conditions or it it really failing in our state this year under the amount of care exchanges premiums were going up forty four percent and the job market\nUh I remember talking to a woman and it just in the Green Bay area who said her situation Christine told me that her plans are growing up I almost two thousand dollars a month\nThat's just not acceptable and so we couldn't wait any longer for Washington fix it only took action here our healthcare stability point I've got a Democrat Republican votes\nI find that the law the Trump Administration just start off at the good was last week where it came out the premiums will be down this coming year starting in January by more than four percent\nThat will be ten percent lower than what were they were headed that's a savings of almost a thousand dollars on premiums and compare that to my opponent Tony Evers wants to do\nOr he wants to deal with Minnesota originally did and when they did that their premiums went up two years ago this month Mark Dayton governor of Minnesota Democrat said in October twenty sixteen he said the Affordable CARE Act is no longer affordable that's cause premiums in his state we're going up by as much sixty seven or\nEight now since then done what we're doing and that causes this year and twenty Eighteen they're pregnant as that goes down our premiums go down or choices ... it'll be good for health care is a clear contrast that people need to cut through all the knives in fact I encourage people to go to\nIf you're on Twitter go to act Scott Walker go there like Facebook side or just go to ... dot com it'd be connected I was amazed you know Steve on Monday\nI get a short little video like twenty two seconds on our uh on the bus we traveled around with the beat up on the campaign\nTwenty two seconds I said central it I just said there a moment ago\nI thought you'd thousand people look at it we're now up to over six hundred thousand years of that one little video shot at it I thought because I mean people are hungry for the truth they want to hear directly for me and I encourage you to go see it in and if you see it pass on other people who may be up in the air because of all these attack ads\nWe got a couple of minutes left with Governor Scott Walker wanted to ask you about Kimberly Clark what do you say the conservatives and are a lot of them said government shouldn't pick winners and losers\nWhy am I getting respect that you know we tried to do is create a better climate why more people working in a safe than ever before it's our our tax cuts have been across the board it's why we cut taxes by ... billion eight billion dollars\nRandomly out of control regulatory environment so that what we're we're doing is protecting public health and public safety you pulled back and frivolous lawsuits improved our workforce\nBut I Believe on occasion there are situations where you get major industries where there was bringing Foxconn like\nHigh tech advanced manufacturing in this case protecting a core industry is far more it's not a paper though it's actually a place where they do cutting edge consumer products there it's just such a big industry that affects not only five hundred people in five hundred families and the five cities but their suppliers almost two hundred suppliers across the state\nAnd this is just one of those court histories we believes important to to to keep and protect here in the state of Wisconsin we're not doing that for every situation or others like bon time then you know I feel bad for the housing but that was a national issue it wasn't a wasn't a state issue then those people aren't enough jobs all over the place 'cause we literally have more jobs\nAnd we are unemployed people to fill them right now\nLast thing is on transportation you your opponents Chinese hard on transportation and what do you how do you respond to that you're you're driving all over the state you're on those roads how do you respond to too many reasons why we have\nGood roads in this state and I hear that from people all the time is I don't know what the heck they're talking about you know the groups under these attack ads are groups and make money off of major interchangeable archaea and it was right over the last decade starting with your around we just finished off the court was hundred changed the beauty of our ... in order to change\nBut I got to tell you haven't raised my kids are more with her so that people in those areas are tired of all the red or orange barrels they're tired of all the land going this way and that what they're happy that the corps this ... just completed\nAnd they don't want any massive new projects\nIn the foreseeable future horrible to put those dollars around the rest of the state last state budget gave a local guy with the biggest increases they received in Twenty years to maintain the roads and bridges we did similar things for a state highways are going to build off the bat giving historically high levels\nOf support for local governments to maintain roads and bridges and to make the interstate highways are not going to take on Boston New entertaining just\nThat's just the difference the groups rather than the ads make money off of bigger changes in places like walkie Europe's that we're giving aid to local governments\nWeren't in the United states of a priority as opposed to try to influence our election and twenty sixteen our presidential election\nNow\nCEO of Facebook the creator of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg at the times that it was crazy\nBut as we know that story develops to the point where they now know we now know that thousands of ads\nPromoting false storylines force false information replaced by Russian agents ... eventually Saturday that he would make it as personal challenge to fix that\nWell one of the ways they've approach that is with something called their war room it's been one piece of this big ongoing project to kind of fix this issue\nAnd it uses a lot of the artificial intelligence systems are facing Facebook has been using to help identify what's authentic and what the actual user behavior\nAnd then they they use this war room and they give other people look at this thing as we approach November six\nThere are director elections and civic engagement and I said there is no substitute for physical real world interaction the primary thing we have learned is just how effective it is that people in the same room altogether so they're going to look at the activity on their platform as it leads up to November six\nThey don't have twenty different teams of employees\nAnd twenty thousand people mostly independent contractors they've hired\nWhose sole purpose is to black fake accounts fictional news\nCurtailing other efforts on Facebook related to the election\nNot\nFacebook to me is always seemed like one of those incredible stories of incredible success an incredible wealth that seems like it's run out of her garage somewhere in California\nWith hardly any oversight although they have thousands of employees because I I see Facebook I see it every day and I see how people interact with it I see some of nonsense that's on there and it does give you pause to think\nOur people trying to influence votes now I I I start with this though if you're dumb enough to be influenced by a Facebook post to have that influence how you vote in election that's on you\nI Can't imagine what somebody could put in a Facebook post that would make me think you know what I mean I've always supported this candidate because of that Facebook posts I'm going to change direction is completely switched parties and vote for somebody you\nKnow I Know some of it as more nuanced than that but let's be real\nSome sectors weighing in um I Will never trust Google Twitter or Facebook one iota even if they're replaced all their workers with nuns from sister trees is kind of a interesting take their a\nIt's an incredibly successful social media platforms\nAnd I ... I've said many times\nIf I look to Twitter for news and information I look to to Facebook to see how my friends and family are doing and my neighbors because that's where I find that up and information more so than living in the same neighborhood or being in the same family up to ... minutes accounts of where they're out what the Haitian Iran\nThat's how I use Facebook to think that some people look at Facebook as a source for political information seems crazy to me\nOne of the members of a ... a blackout leading up to the twenty Eighteen the terms of twenty twenty\nPresidential election that's not going to happen but maybe you should impose your own blackout maybe it should be more discerning consumer of information it is what it is\nImpose your own blackout maybe you should be more discerning consumer of information it is what it is you want to see cat pictures you want to see what your neighbors vacation look like go to Facebook for them all the other stuff the fake ads\nThe the ads for things you'll never buy\n\nIt doesn't seem to me like a source of of solid good information but I I applaud them for at least making the efforts\nBut again if you're dumb enough to be influenced by Facebook come on people you got to be smarter than that especially in the current climate of politics after the break is kicking off this week the Milwaukee film festival\nGood news for local folks and a big events here in Milwaukee worn out and that started Indonesians\nWith you on Thursday so bracing ten fifty three forty degrees at Radio City actually not a\nBad day today sunshine and at least in my neck of the woods they sort of listening is always the Milwaukee film festival air kicking off this week big events\nAnd yeah it starts tonight it is the tent annual film festival and something to take ... take heart in and appreciate even if you're not a movie person and don't really care about the festival\nThe way this has grown in what they're trying to do to educating teach young filmmakers is really quite amazing the film festival in Milwaukee is now in the top ten of largest in the country and it took 'em ten years to get there they have so many local\nFilmmakers local editors producers writers involved in this year one of the films in the documentary about Lance\nSide John you may know that name kept inside John of course Jean Miller did the WTO carries with his memorial and the plane being brought up near the airport Jonathan Jackson says yeah there's a documentary of screening especially for him rate\nLocal war heroes half and Lance Peter side job and his story and it's spreading that it's called by they'll walk yeah it was really excited clear remarried and the first of all I Know that screening on Tuesday October twenty third in Maine out so the oriental theaters going to be a really\nReally special screening at the festival so couldn't be happier if somebody who survived for forty five days without food water and just out of them are credible story as he invaded enemy structure\nThere is a local connection to the story of course as far as she was directed and produced in about ... sister who's been on the air with us a few times used part of a documentary the opening screening tonight it's called science fair I entered a UC nice\nDiverse you know what I'm saying is not part of it on on a one of the public stations\nThat was co directed by a Milwaukee will move and how it would be closing the film is also directed by someone from Milwaukee so lots of local filmmakers which I just find very impressive you wouldn't think of Milwaukee in that way and I did learn something\nSo I have you ever been to the oriental theater oh yeah oh yeah so you way back when\nThe Oregon the orders would come out the keyboard and would play up on the stage there before the Saturday shows sometimes they play during the other ones do but usually it was on the weekends or do you play that it would sink back into the stage and it was always kind of a neat thing that we just unique thing that happened after you were in a theater where earlier this year they took that Oregon out the owners of the organ\nSaid they needed it took it out so now there is no Oregon's being played and oriental but\nApparently I asked Jonathan about this he says\nThere could be one coming back where we hear Oregon music again if the oriental some day\n[laughter] we absolutely well where are you know we all have an announcement during the film festival this year but we're very excited the Arabs are in the process of securing and Oregon that I'm even more excited about that and that previous on that was out\nWithin eater uh that uh the previous one with not actually original to the theater and what we think we have our hands on and are about to announce it an argument that uh is actually a ridge at all to the theater\nWhen I'm going to have him down and out of leaving something out there for people to be decided about an hour or so you know I Can't quite break that one today\nSo there you go in Oregon original to the theater rapid be announced at some point not during the festival\nI gave it a while that's that's an incredibly bizarre especially if it's if it's a germane to that actual theater that was always a big part of the oriental experience rather than Oregon music that school speaking of Oregon used to have you been following these stories about the Oregon a player at the Dodgers stadium\nGuy was Milwaukee connections I Love the music he plays the places are really cool music than kind of more than ... baseball takes him risks oh yeah [laughter] yeah he's like all over the place I thought that was really cool that you know his dad would bring 'em back some Milwaukee's parents' divorce his dad was here\nAnd you go to the old county stadium and then the Oregon and and listen to all those songs and now he's actually doing that for a living at Dodger Stadium how cool is that yes absolutely All right well thanks for that story and Markey film festivals very cool and and I wasn't there was a couple of thousand or one of the Oregon was one but two of the fact that it's in the top ten now for film festivals\nWhat they've been able to do it's really quite remarkable in the educational component you know me I'm big into that where you develop young minds and all that they do so many things for teens in like teaching them how to do that and when you think filmmakers you always think of giant movie screens\nIt's not just that look at your phone moving pictures are everywhere now and you can help develop that teach you to learn from it and find new ways to use it and that's what they're doing\nThat if you if you get a chance to see that science fair thing from what I've seen this thing is amazing I imagine science nerds who who\nThey are they acknowledge their science there's but they see that as a badge of honor him they just excel at what they do and and how they celebrate it and the little snippet I saw that was like an amazing film so check it out I'm On the film festival this week\nAt the oriental a good stuff fun stuff\nAlright eleven o'clock hour we have a lot of fun stuff to talk about where to start with something that\nI haven't talked about in a while the mother investigation and I'm gonna ask you a question\n\nAll accounts wrapping this investigation up as we have to the new year frankly that's a good thing because if it finds as I think it will but there was no collusion we need to move on business frankly taken up too much airtime too much of the oxygen in the room\nBased on really I think in most cases Democrats wanting something to be their their inability to get over the twenty sixteen presidential election\n\nWhat does our occasional guest on the program Dennis Miller committee and say I don't think the Democrats have really gotten over that twenty six election not handling it very well well they are not look to California for an example of that\nOut of their mind about this president out of their mind in what they're doing to try to bring this president down including their latest fiasco the Kavanaugh nomination\nWherever won states\nMerely acting exclusively to try to take down a president based on what they saw happening twenty sixteen is that the illusion I Know you can call it that is it the arrangement trumped arrangement syndrome I guess but what it really is\nIs folks wanting something to be the case\nWith all the evidence suggesting that would actually happen\nWe'll find out Robert Mueller will tell us at some point or Rod Rosenstein will tell us at some point what we're looking at here but for all of us I think it's good news of the things can be wrapped up five December at least that's all signs point in that direction that is good news for the state more than ... with you on WTO ...\nHoliday radio show several Youtube videos on the night before Christmas starring\nGina Miller shame Matt in

Reggie ... actually know some of his relatives very well great people\nWell he's got to finally get his do and it's a guy who grow up watching wrestling on Saturday morning the crush or south Milwaukee was one of the icons of wrestling\nWhat was the thing he did he would have the beer keg on his shoulder and you'd be running through town\nHe was fun to watch fun to listen to the city of south Milwaukee then you can remember we we helped with us after we had Chris Smith one of the organizers on the show\nThey are going to now puts a replica of the crush are located after a near their cities train station they're old train station eleventh Milwaukee avenues um honoring this great I kind of south Milwaukee's existence\nOr the ... or a common name and that part of the ... of the area I Know a lot of them\nWhat I Love about this story is it recognizes a local\nPerson for life well lift and\nWhether you're a wrestling fan or not this is somebody then embrace life had fun Dave Milwaukee some notoriety and the rest of the world and even beyond that because he was a character unique don't we all love people that are that stand out that uh\nAre interesting\nI mean not ready to ask you to crush it was one of those people so the folks in South Milwaukee they raise the money they can opt about fifty thousand dollars I talked to marry or Brooks at the uh turned her whole part of the other day she showed up um they raise the money\nHe said all the people are asking where this thing going whereas this thing going now they know he sat in a in a Journal Sentinel stories are really really fun way to celebrate our most famous son and I agree with them\nI'd be hard pressed to find somebody from South Markey more famous than the crush her ... so for all those folks who've been waiting for those folks who donated myself included\nAre day has come well if it soon will come crush of crush or regime of south you'll be honored in South Milwaukee\nHome sound guy wrestler extraordinary lived a great life and or will it be the bronze find the south Milwaukee addition I don't know I'm guessing it's going to be popular I'm guessing a lot of people will traveled to south Milwaukee they have their picture taken with the pressure\nAnd if somebody has to lead a city right next to south walking when people come near a city and want to do things on a shop wanna eats want to see what your studies about it doesn't get any better than that and and the the idea that you can to promote your city have fun and celebrate a great life\nA great human being that I have fun while he was alive the crush of ... out of yourself Marky how cool is that and ah I'm happy that we could play one small part in that story lines with the crush or now has a home or soon have a home rather in South Milwaukee\nComing up after the news does age matter especially when you're talking about president it's just nice as I said earlier presidents\nSixty or Seventy two when he ran for president Donald Trump Hillary Clinton sixty eight year old folks have they been running the show too long the horse could take a shot at the world series which unsung hero\nHas the best chance of having the team get their ... for thirty four I'm Wisconsin's afternoon news\nOf the city with you on this Thursday temperature keeps going up Jordan I think we've got we've got a winner of the other Wisconsin weather day in October I'll take it may even get to fifty five that would be a comfortable temperature for this time of the year\nI'm One of the taxpayers was\nChiding me on the statue apparently it's duck crush or da crush or not the pressure I guess I wasn't saying it right duck pressure planned the way he said it\nAnd also they they asked one of the time she was asked why not a statue for ... bacon and I I don't know if you're probably too young to remember who take baking was the thinking it was a guy in Milwaukee I don't really want to you WM\nWho often in the wintertime and the fall and the cold months would be tanning at the lake friends\nWith his little swimsuit on with these Big M reflective panels\nTanning and he always had a great time actually ran into him in Daytona Beach Florida of telling stories sometime interesting interesting guy who was a he was into body building for a while anybody my age knows him but I think he passed away a few years ago but the one with like you said why not a statue for him and\nHeck why nots as we know what the bronze fines and soon to know about the crush or statue in South Markey these things drop people people is what cities wants to help them do business so smart play by sophomore year All right\nI asked the question before the news how old is too old to be president so let's start with the other end of the spectrum\nBefore youngest president you know it is number four Ulysses S ... he was forty six tied with him Bill Clinton\nI didn't think Bill Clinton was that young but he was forty six years old and he took office or John Kennedy second youngest this new forty three years old and the winner of the youngest president ever was Theodore Roosevelt forty two years old\nYou have to be thirty five to the president and I would argue at thirty five I don't really know enough to be president but uh as in many things in this country\nWe can always be shocked and surprised by what happens and or the elections I guess always shocking surprise us maybe twenty six years ago the example of that why did I bring this up because former vice president former Senator Joe Biden\nHas been mowing the idea of running in twenty twenty as a Democrat that's not the surprising part either Democrat\nBut he's been asked about his age and right now Joe Biden's Seventy five he'll be Seventy seven when this campaign season for the presidential primary elections began\nLots of people like Joe Biden lots of Democrats wanting to run but he hasn't said he will yet but he's done many things indicate he might be making that decision\nHi I'm just wanted to say that the pope and the queen I'm Better be worried about their job is five there is an age limit on how old it is that you are capable of I'm\nRunning a a group of people that's a great point I Would give you a ... I'm gonna give you my unofficial color of the day [noise]\nAnd value get you get the bell rang\nThat's a great points the poll hey the queen I think I mean what is the Ninety years old on Ninety to\nNinety two but she's still leading her country now didn't write down in the legislative sense but in in the uh the the lead leadership position as the head of ... of a country and then I noticed that people seem to be happy with those two individual right\nSome thought thank you Cathy\nLet's go to let's squeeze one more to Jordan let's go to Terry Terry are are going to get the last word series of Milwaukee ...\nHigh I who I Would not worry about the fact that they might as well and I feel like it will be\nHurt my private life more than the current very\nVery good thanks for that call Terry I'm I've met Joe Biden had a conversation with couple conversations with him he's sharp he's got a lot of experience there is no doubt\nYou can talk about Kamala Harris Cory Booker some of the Elizabeth Warren who frankly it's against no chance of getting nomination Joe Biden has been through\nAll the issues he's dealt with them as a as a legislator as a vice presidents some of the most significant events of our country in our history\nThat's the reason why is a serious candidate I don't care how old are you I'm not a Democrat but if I was a Democrat I Would take Joe Biden seconds or some of the other folks who are running for office couldn't Kamala Harris Cory Booker they're grandstanding there's\nThere are people whose political ambition is blinding them to the fact that the president's\nIs not there to grandstand president there is there too\nThe mission is blinding them to the fact that the president's\nIs not there to grandstand president there is there to lead and even the current president for all those folks who say never criticized the current president should take a lesson from Joe Biden at least on that thing although he's a member of the other party I ended up the jury ... for Jeff Wagner that's ...

have been waiting for a chance to kind of a\nPut Nineteen eighty two to bad this weekend is that opportunity with games friday and Saturday at Miller Park that I Know the crowds are going to be tremendous they're going to be loud proud brewers fans and um you're thinking about playing the Dodgers they're not going to be a lot of Dodgers fans there it's just going to be\nGood old brewers fan screaming their their lungs out for a chance to go to the world series and you know what they can do it just got to play better than they have I have played I wanted to I even though it was the last last night we'd been been playing um some great work by one of our producers are asked around me who are put together\nThe audio\nPlay back of the ah the games as we've gone through the end of year so I Want to play for that play that for you now just to look back at last night's game in a kind of sets up the discussion for the next hour or so on the brewers\nAnd there's no a second chance as you got one or two games then you go to the world series and how how cool would that be so we spent some time and all that brewer stuff in the next hour just kinda dissecting all these different angles on the beach\nSeries the season and our quest to revisit the world series for the first time since Nineteen eighty two that's all coming up after the news right here on WGM Jay good morning\nWith you on this Thursday so here we are [noise] ...\nSee I have to win two games so the next hour\nIn the spent some time and a lot of different aspects of this uh the series some some things that bothered me about the baseball um\nWe're going to start though and and challenge to the folks on Facebook dot com you can you can you can find us basically dot coms plastic porn WGM Jay can questions comments or going to have those there I'll Try to get to those as I can also text us are calling for one for seven nine nine one six to one of the mortgage talking text line\nSo a couple of things many Machado find ten thousand dollars for running in the first baseman ... are you are game for the CS\nIt seems like hey sewers amendment chowder of gotten over it because you always have some really strong pointed comments I guess I asked the question is that enough\nNot really a fine for a guy like that it's going to make probably what two hundred and fifty million dollars in his next contract that's like me paying fifty cents to somebody [laughter] but they did find him and rats\nWhat two hundred and fifty million dollars in his next contract that's like me paying fifty cents [laughter] but they did find him and rather quickly so clearly there is something that uh they didn't like about what happened on the field at Dodger Stadium Bruce Fleming\nDidn't like it retired and there'll be umpires you know their neck one now he was on channel for\nTrying to hurt another individual you ... your ... to his leg rights and as an official it's your job to protect the other player\n... says we should have been thrown out here's the thing and and they're coming back to the park for hopefully a game is six and seven if he does something like that I Would not be shocked if he got thrown out of the game now he's done several things during the series\nHe seems as Christian yellow subs to be a dirty player which is silly because he's a incredibly talented star and major league baseball his arm\nMight be one of the best arms in the shortstop in major league baseball and\nSometimes it seems like he can padded gloves three times or the ball and still be the runner by a few stuff you know I mean that's how quick ... and how hard he throws back to first base so clearly of talented player or one four seven nine nine one six one day I can the mores talking talks on the other big conversation I Want to have\nAnd this is this is interesting for a lot of reasons you were you and I were talking during the break\nIf they get the Saturday which is still if you have to have to win of course the game tomorrow the start timing this game as H. O. nine local time were\nNine nine east coast six oh nine in the west coast like get that your your your planes that Dodger crowd and then you are the leading the series but we're not what I'm thinking about baseball\nAnd and trying to lure in New viewers new new fans little kids they're not going to be able to stay up so to a you know one in the morning midnight\nAnd ... we'll be midnight before we know who investigate well\nWe've seen even in these two one deems that they've had three two games the games take\nFour hours Fifteen minutes or hours like none of these things are fast and they get there than it was selling their commercials and all that stuff\nAnd so that's another one we can kick around what are you thinking about these late start times I don't I'm not a fan of it I understand why they do it's it's about ratings trying to get that that the west coast the audience to be able to watch after they get home from work which but it's a Saturday\nYeah that's true in in California than in the work never stopped throwing that there's always rush hours you know twenty four seven to California so just people moving around and it's tough to get home so [noise]\nUh it's an interesting debates let's go to Brian in Brookfield what do you think Brian\nIs taking my call yeah I think he's a dirty player and he just wants to win and I think it'd be most of the get the back then I mean look at\nSomeone like grapes and Alan from your kid either phenomenal basketball player but he got suspended for tripping people with flagrantly instill good looking down I can still who was the dominant that the capital but when he steps that the one hand that\nYou know people that are that level of athletic they did something in their brain that just click and they do whatever it takes to win even though it dirty even though that the fact that the addition\nAlex Rodriguez last night the yesterday afternoon said that he thought he could cost them twenty or thirty million dollars on his contract you by the\n... not at all like you said in the opening either they get two hundred and fifty million dollars and ten thousand dollar fine that's not even a bottle of champagne\nWhen I re I Know these things that Bush a big I'm up\nI'm Glad we didn't\nYeah I don't think they they couldn't afford to thanks for the call Bryan it's an interesting debate because you have the again incredibly talented player\nWho has as as the colleges that have some of this weird court where he likes to do things that the kinda borderline not even borderline cross over the line of sportsmanship and and thinking about it on his on his face value\nHe's trying to some degree to hurt other players yeah the your opponents but does that really the way you want to approach the game maybe it's some of the way he approaches the game from his perspective let's go to John ... W teams in the morning John\nCorning um I I I think\nWhat cleaning the child who did it it it was scary it was still play I mean it was like she was trying to show off and say that oh you like to see like he's really good like you know it it doesn't matter what he does all equally if it gets out\nAnd show who he is from ... I think it was the band played\nBy hits part you know you know shame on them because if we come back and ... ... the doctors say we'll talk a little while and you know you can look back probably\nAt that and then you wonder if things for the cause and you wonder if he's going if he cares at all and my my uh my inclination is to suggest that he doesn't just always seems to be this is the guy that got on national TV\nBefore game five\nAnd she might have been before getting foreign said I'm running to first base was not his running hard hustling for space is not as a cup of tea this is a major league\nAthletes whose job it is to play sports who said that running all the way hard to first base doesn't seem to be something he could die indoors so take that for what it's worth let's take a quick break for one for seven nine nine wants to one of the more he's talking text line Facebook\nDot coms like six twenty there'll be team Jay questions and comments there as well\nMany Machado was he find enough ten thousand dollars a corner and\nSources uh MLD was the find is that enough what else should happen to them any maternal that's necessarily going to be the engine\nNinety seven seems to be with you on this Thursday forty one degrees at Radio City thank you for listening as always no matter how you're listening whether it's over the airways\nSix twenty WGM zero one oh three ton FM love the fact that you're a part of the conversation you can also find us on Facebook dot com slash just when he's WGM Jay I'm\nMainly China and there'll be\nPlenty some sources said he was fined ... uh ten thousand dollars for running into brewers first baseman have says hey you are is that enough what should happen to him got a lot of tax and a lot of calls Jeff from Fox points the only way to stop and do that again is to suspend them yes have sous forgave him but what if you hurt someone else good points\nAre from the two six to of major league baseball is only going to find a player like that ten thousands of decorum equivalent to about a dollar out of my paycheck\nThey better be consistent actually when people are running over each other more often\nThat's what I said and and I think what what could happen here is if he does anything else in these next two games I Would not be shocked if he got thrown out of the game you know what I'm sort of where of it and they'll be aware of it and we've had at least three instances during this series just\nThe series the point to a guy that seems a little bit out of control so there's there's a lot of potential here for some interesting a dialogue between the brewers and the Dodgers coming up at Miller Park starting tomorrow let's go to Jeff in when you're let me see I'm Jake morning Jeff\nAll right let's get my car\nSo what's happening here\nAt tractor Iraq way you're gonna find them or they're already covered quite you know I Wonder what I Would feel if somebody tried to impact on you\nKnow what your chance I think somebody ought to try and\nIt'll be interesting to see things for the call Jeff if somebody retaliate so he got being in the game yesterday a but it wasn't\nIt didn't seem to me like it was intentional uh and and then we can argue about that probably the rest of the show but it it it looked like it was just a pitch that got away from the brewers pitcher and I and I think if you look at that so I didn't shed any tears for many Machado I think he is a dirty player and a Christian yellowish hasn't exactly rights\nWhat he's doing is diminishing his great talents which is significant he's clearly a\nTop ten player in baseball is defensive skills is offensive power\nAnd as I mentioned just as ability to get the ball back to first base on a on a ground ball passing credible let's go to John in Brookfield your W teams that morning John\nThe morning I have no doubt everybody in lower on on their feet when he comes back tomorrow\nI saw that when you are on the on the call screener and I and I encourage every brewers fan and ... and thank you for pointing that out to be as loud as you can when many Machado comes to the plate or or whatever his name is mentioned as part of this game I think we need to send a message loudly\nIt wasn't until I got out on the street that I realized there was something really\nWrong the lights were out there already you could see smoke or as people everywhere firemen already you know on I'm seeing him and\nThere was a live streaming and panic country can going on [noise] you had heard a plane that building\nAnd naive really we you know I was thinking again waxing assessing up\nBy the time I got to the twenty third and Broadway which is about cross town area midtown area of Manhattan I saw large crowds of people looking salad toward the world Trade Center\nAnd it was at that and see I'm sure that I saw\nFireball [noise]\nShe anything there is just another loud\nAnd that was probably the scared as I was [noise]\nI remember at one point there was a lot of concern about other tall buildings in Manhattan\nAnd where I work is very close to the Empire State building and so there was a lot of panic actually in costs midtown area\nTo get away from all\nTall buildings when we did finally get out\nThere was stuck in the street on fire [noise]\nAnd um you know the police were there you know standing post telling us you know which way to run [noise] a policeman was on the corner and he said\nIf I were you I keep running we have no idea what's going on [noise]\nWe were learning that this was a terrorist attack I was in Chinatown when itself [noise]\nI just for people screaming\nYou know if people aren't streets looking down see the towers\nAnd screaming [noise] I did not turn around I\n\nSomewhere around Chinatown and what's changed we're operating [noise] when I was able to get on the train ride I recall it being sell jam packed with people\nAnd nobody said a word\nIt was silent [noise]\nMy brother was in New York City at that point [noise]\nYou know thinking about running from the building and and those guys firemen pass run to the [noise]\n\nStand in our corners while they're telling us around [noise] wondering where we're Tom [noise]\nThat day he was dead which is great um selfishly but um that's still\nThe hardest part to try and figure out where he was\nOne of my closest friends father [noise]\nHe was a retired New York city firemen who then was working fire safety for the world Trade Center and I've seen a lot when you know when I was working there down in the lobby and [noise]\nThey a lot safer deepest going to evacuate childcare\nYou know didn't [noise] it got a call from another friend later on Christmas Day I can [noise]\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Brooklyn net to get home the\nAsh for piling on the cars that lets piling on\nThe street and nobody thought everybody within ... much shock\n[noise] I\nTry I coming from the south a faint glow of orange light\nAnd and said moved closer toward to me\nThat a little bit prior and a little bit brighter and then I can hear a\nBunch of people around me and it wasn't just the country it\nWas a hundred people and you couldn't see them\nAnd they were all sharing and they were all laughing because ... orange light came closer to Columbine [noise]\nIt's Harriet emerging between outline of his truck and then you could see\nSay that cell and they had when they think about it because\nAll those people were out there on the street just sharing on higher\n\nYou think of all the people that were there that day you know the policemen and firemen gave their lives are doing their job\nI really do you wonder why I\nI was lucky and um you know I think it's been acted like lifting out I think a little different they\nRealize some quick change you know\nFamily can manage\nThe words of Mike Franks and Jessica ... Jessica west bend native Mike Frank's from Mac one now both of them in New York\nLiving there and working there during the attacks they mentioned several times and this was not a question that I asked them what they both brought up first responders several times when you heard that year and that is part of this nine eleven memorial so when we talk about raising the beam it's more than\nThose who are lost that day it's more than the ground zero folks who set in spent time there and then later lost their life from the health ramifications is more than just the U.S military\nThat enlisted after the fact after nine eleven were inspired by nine eleven and decided to go and then give the ultimate sacrifice like some of them did it's also those first responders it's the firefighters the police officers\nWho were there he said if they were standing post she's running like mad to get out of there and who knows tops were standing there\nGo this way go this way go go go just telling them to get out of dodge and they're running toward the building I mean that that these are these are moments in our history that we need to continue to share continue to tell other people about and that's why this memorial is so important and if we raise the beam\nFuture generations including the young generation that currently is here with us can learn more about this and see what actually happened that day\nThat's what I Love about this this effort of it it kind of combines all of these different areas of the story right to education piece to the history lesson that were you getting from this just hearing from those survivors the fact that a teacher on on your however met her parents\nHave worked so hard to kind of keep her memory alive but also to understand there were so many other people are affected you talked about veterans yes first responders ... that that piece that first respond herpes\nWhile others were running away they run towards that that is something that so many people don't understand about Christmas\nAnd think of that impact if you go to this site and you see the piece of steel and you're sitting there in the amphitheater they're going to build a new there was a place where you can speak can you hear on Mike Frank's talk or just go with some very good talk or you here Julie Andrews sister just talk about what happened when you see it first hand in here at first hand\nThat can add so much more value than just seen it in a textbook to think of it that way so how can folks out there you go to W. team dot com and help us raised the beam it's phase one of their memorial project\nOr forty thousand dollar if it's so it's it's this is a heavy lift no pun intended a heavy lift to get this beam\nUp in the year so we need your help WGM dot com you can see the link you can see the rendering if you like and we even make it easier Steve you can touch the words beam at ... am to Fort Irwin four seven nine nine months six twenty and we will send you all the information and you can decide what you'd like to give if any\nAnd thanks to the folks at first base financial center as well for a kind of having a achieve what we can ah we're trying to achieve race

who knows this year set a gene Miller's house\nAnd we all get snowed in what happens next we got to show up and ah and find out what other teams that I kind of information on that so little good news about the brewers and all the fun stuff happening out there\nSo you can win not when you can get a free burger George was two to six PM today one person or if you can't make it during those already get a free voucher for for one of those burgers last time it happened thirty one years ago\nWhen she nearly seven of course this is all based on a production\nThat George Wild in the Nineteen forties to have the they're watching baseball team win twelve games in a row took me thirty one years to uh to make that happen and then [laughter] fuel for decades and\nIt took them thirty one years to uh to make that happen and then\nA few more decades and it's happening again because brewers winning twelve straight from the regular season into the the postseason here's one of those interesting stories about this a guy named mark lever junior and his girlfriend went to a George webs in Bay side not even there anymore\nHey good morning great to be ... thanks paramount\nSo I got to ask you before it gets into politics the stores thing isn't as somebody who's running for office running for reelection does that get in the way or do you does it kind of adds to the experience when you talk on the phone with guys hard\nTo make that fine makes it enjoyable you don't want to travel\nOr even if it's during a time we got it on the radio we we're hearing yesterday I was in the event that had it up on my phone checking the score give people updates that I was talking 'cause it was obviously in an earlier in the afternoon it's a lot of fun and it gives me an excuse to dress down and whenever you're all the time so I'm looking back\nAlthough I Do know that can get away with it tomorrow the debate thrown at at eight I may have half the moderator to give us an occasional thing\nShe I mean out of the ...\nYeah most people will be watching the game and probably if if anything taping or so or anything I say about the birds were probably already know by the time they want you\nHow's this uh this reelection been different than lasting\nWell I'll just sitting there has to climate so much different so you know in two thousand fourteen as we did it to the camera can have the winter or back and then at night you know a lot of people tied into the current president it's really more just historical I mean when Obama was the president Republicans did well in the off years\nWhen George Bush was the other way around it it's just part of the historical trends so you're fighting kind of your swimming upstream but\nVoters in Wisconsin are smart we've been through a lot ... won the most engaged electric in the country and and I believe in the end we get our facts out any more people are working this year than ever before um or schools continue to be some of the best of the nation property taxes are down from where we started\nWith a lot of good things happen again I Can't imagine that people want to turn back now\nDoes this let's send you that the ... that the economic prosperity that we've seen in a state law unemployment a company adding jobs increasing their wages paying bonuses that that doesn't get a ... a hired a space on the front page of newspapers\nOh yeah it's amazing I mean this is one business a has a few\nAre fewer people it gets a big deal and and yet I guess that we have people employed in the state of Wisconsin than ever before we've already had seven consecutive months of record what when employment or this year it's really remarkable what I think the trend is likely to continue again a ... job numbers come out later today\nJust look at all the good things and as I was campaigning with Tommy Thompson the other day you know the great reminder that the naysayers Nevada so impressed because of all how can you find two thirds of school education and and still make plans you're going to cut property tax Tommy did it I Know I was there with them I served in the legislature\nAnd he did it when he was governor and we just made historic investments in schools and still got property taxes in fact\nSometimes it amazes me that Tony Evers called my kid my budget approach kid budget he said his priorities we're in line with our parties\nOr at least that's what he said when he was running for a third term state superintendent now he says something a little bit different but I guess that's 'cause he's running for different office but the facts haven't changed good physical management the major reforms that have saved schools more than three billion dollars in state and local governments more than five billion dollars\nIn a in helping the people at the state or the job critics create more jobs more opportunities it's been good for the state and will be if we can keep moving forward\nTalking to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker the existing conditions in in the name one of those hot topic things has shown up in a lot of TV ads set the record straight on ... where you're at on that\nYeah see that's a great question because if I Want to be clear we can protect people with preexisting conditions state\nAnd not have to protect the failure that as Obamacare it and it's a nationally coordinated effort where they tried it's hard to to to get it that's just not the case in Wisconsin today\nEveryone living with the pre existing conditions covered governor or they always will be you know like a lot of families it's personal to me a lot of your listeners right now I can relate to my\nUh my wife is a type ... diabetic type ... diabetic my mom is a cancer survivor she overcame breast cancer and my brother David my younger brother has a heart condition so we know what it's like to have pre existing conditions\nFor us it's personal and for a lot of families across the state we were always cover people with preexisting conditions in the state the reason they want to talk about that instead of Obamacare's Obamacare suffered from pre existing condition\nA ... it's really failing in our state this year under the Obama Care exchanges premiums were going up forty four percent of the job market but I remember talking to a woman and it just in the Green Bay area who said in her situation Christine told me that her plans are going up by almost two thousand dollars a month\nAccount acceptable and so we couldn't wait any longer for Washington fix if you took action here our healthcare stability point I'd got both Democrat Republican votes I find that the law the Trump Administration just I thought it was last week where it came out the premiums will be down this coming year starting in January by more than four percent\nThat will be ten percent lower than where they're headed that's a savings have almost a thousand dollars in premiums and compare that to my opponent Tony Evers wants to do a he went to deal with Minnesota originally did and when they did that their premiums went up two years ago this month Mark Dayton governor of Minnesota Democrat said in October twenty sixteen he\nSaid the Affordable CARE Act is no longer affordable as cause premiums in his state are going up by as much as sixty seven or\nEight now since then done what we're doing and that's his claws this this year in twenty eight team their premiums are going down our premiums go down or choices ... it'll be good for health care is a clear contrast the people need to cut through all the knives and in fact I encourage people to go to\nIf you're on Twitter going to ask Scott Walker go to Facebook site or just go to Scott walk back time it'd be connected I was amazed you know Steve on Monday\nI did a short little video like twenty two seconds on our uh on the bus we traveled around with the beat up comic camp paid twenty two seconds I said central it I just said there a moment ago\nI thought you thousand people look at it we're now up to over six hundred thousand years of that one little video shot and I thought because people are hungry for the troops they want to hear directly for me and I encourage you to go see it in and if you see it pass on other people who may be up in the air because of all these attack ads\nWe got a couple of minutes left with Governor Scott Walker wanted to ask you about Kimberly Clark what do you say the conservatives and are a lot of them the same government shouldn't pick winners and losers\nWhy am I getting respect that you know we tried to do is create a better climate why more people working in a safe than ever before it's wire or tax cuts have been across the board is why we cut taxes by ... billion eight billion dollars\nRandomly out of control regulatory environment so that we're we're we're doing is protecting public health and public safety\nYou pulled back and frivolous lawsuits improves our workforce\nBut I Believe on occasion there are situations where you got nature industry sweat it was bringing Foxconn with high tech advanced manufacturing ... protecting accord industry is far more it's not a paper do it's actually a place\nWhere they do cutting edge consumer products there it's just such a big industry that affects not only five hundred people and five hundred families and the five cities but their suppliers almost two hundred suppliers across the state\nThis is just one of those court histories we believes important to to to keep and protect here in the state of Wisconsin we're not doing that for every situation or others like bon time you know I feel bad for the closing but that was a national issue it wasn't a wasn't a state issue\nThen those people are looking up jobs all over the place 'cause we literally have more jobs and we have unemployed people to fill them right now\nLast thing is on transportation you your opponents trying to hit hard on transportation what do you how do you respond to that you're you're driving all over the states you're on those roads how do you respond to what twenty reasons and we have\nGood roads in this state and I hear that from people all the time is I don't know what the heck they're talking about you know the groups running these attack ads are groups and make money off of major interchange in the Milwaukee and it was right over the last decade starting with Jim Brown we just finished off the court was hundred changed the market in order to change\nBut I got to tell you haven't raised my kids are all into so that people in those areas are tired of all the red or orange barrels they're tired of all the land going this way and that they're happy that the court that you're going to change is completed\nBut they don't want any massive new projects\nIn the foreseeable future more able to put those dollars round the rest of the state last state budget gave local governments the biggest increases they received in Twenty years to maintain the roads and bridges we did similar things for a state highways are going to build off of that giving historically high levels\nOf support for a local governments to maintain roads and bridges and to make the interstate highways are not going to take on Boston New interchange is and it's just the difference the groups running ads make money off of bigger changes in places like Milwaukee they're upset we're giving aid to local governments\nI think most people see that the bats\nI'm going to make money off of begin to different places like hockey Europe that we're giving aid to local government\nI think most people see that that that's where that's where it has the both positive and back that far back in a row and that's a contract because they want you know the gas tax increase its way Tony University of course you want a key families up into one\nWas bigger than a dollar a gallon that would be twelve hundred dollars\nFor a family with two of their cars will stay wipe out of a case that when wind up or your college savings what really fundamental difference between Tony recently he wants to raise property taxes he wants to return to ... wants to raise gas locks without offers seven billion dollars is it still does that mean crack it\nOr we know we can find our priorities like off like worker training like technical colleges like caring for elderly uncovering preexisting condition and we can still do it if we found in the past by lowering the overall burden on the hard working taxpayers of the state that's how we was on\nGovernor Scott

fantastic Oh hi Stacy how are you high road how are you good ... you get yourself back acclimated to the Wisconsin lifestyle here I took a while [laughter] real loud but [laughter]\nSo I care and was just down and we were talking about safety concerns did you ever feel like we were not safe\nNo and that's really what I wanted to call because\nIt was not one iota or why even thought that you have to be feeling unsafe in fact I was talking to ... I felt safer and easier than I did in front of the European countries we've been in in that um\nYou know we've been good for you like almost got pocket or how many try to run a con aren't going to get money on you and you're not one feeling like that at all and you check\nIn and I think we all agree that not only did these um our guide have our best interests at heart but at any given time we had people surrounding us that we're making sure that we were not doing anything\nCrazy and and and we even went into the bizarre that the last night we were there in downtown Cairo and even there I did not feel unsafe\nNo I agree I it just safety with not a concern at all and and I also have to put a plug in for Fox too because when we saw this um ... pop up in an email we we're probably one of the forthcoming book and we probably in the box well that I think we book knowing that\nYou know this trip would be polled if there was any you know in claim that anything what's happening over there it was unsafe to go we were so confident\nOkay what about going to the Caribbean and the summer though\nOkay I mean you know that your your um hurricane season as it were is considered to be June one through December one\nNow shipping fleet June through August is the beginning of the season and we don't see a lot of activity in the beautiful thing about being on a cruise ship is if you do have any hurricane activity they can sail around it\nSo you know that's better than being an all inclusive resort where you know you're going to be you know hit\nAnd then um as far as the destination once we get there or what types of things are there to do\nWell to speed you hold it really um some of those excursions are going to include like snorkeling trips or they do have a private island that they take you too and that's always a good time there's great um you you all just get a big beach commander maybe and hang out that kind of thing\nBut quite quite honestly there aren't a lot of um side trips that are going to be I Would say educational for your trip for the kids those are typically you know the pirates came they plundered they came back new new people took over a lot of cannons letter for those kinds of things but\nQuite honestly it's really more about being together and and experience the the ship and experiencing probably beach destinations\nOkay so what would be an alternative to that um because we wanted the land part of it to also be an educational on something for the cat Fidel um\nYeah it's it's tough to do if you've already done Alaska then you definitely have\nUm you know hit the right thing the other thing that you could consider it but it would not be in the summer would maybe be something like a fall foliage trip or something like that because that does you know Boston then up to bar harbour and that kind of a thing\nBut if you're doing a summer cruise unless you go to Europe which is going to be pretty\nCost prohibitive probably with the airfare it's a little tricky\nOkay um what about Hawaii\nHawaii would be good there's one cruise line that does just a seven day a Hawaii crews and that's going to be in the L Prize of a mirror\nAnd what they've done there is a very wisely spent a lot of time in the various ports of call you know there were in fact and truth support so called mowing one or the other one you were overnight being in the port of call so if you really wanted to go to that night ... um luau or something like that you can do that\nSo that might be a good option as well\nOkay probably a little bit more to do in the

T. S. H. Y. G. Jay and cared the two largest and basically these are ATS that are supposed to mimic the performance\nA basket of high income junk bond securities the problem is that those underlying markets are very thin Angela's agree that an ATF like H y G goes down sharply that means those underlying securities need to be sold in order to match up the exposure\nAnd you know in a case of an ill liquid market where H y G could be trading below net assets value that could continue for some time until buyer shows up which is one of the reasons why we like active managers and high yield because they know this they know that they can pick off stupid volatility like that\nAnd get things back back in line but now the short run things can go awry\nYou know when we start talking about how you bonds and other fixed income instruments you start thinking about the fed and rising interest rates and do we were talking about they're a little bit about the shift of risk between equities and bombs in a rising rate environment\nAnd there are certainly is a trade off between risk in return in as interest\nCertainly is a trade off between risk in return in as interest rates start to go up we have to pay attention to it and that's the reason why the fed governors so much attention because the fed clearly says they intend to continue to raise rates staring and that's the reason why we pay attention to it\nYeah they they did it the fed minutes they suggest that they're going to raise rates in December the likely to the ads about eighty percent according to the futures markets are there still pointed at three increases next year\nBut you know as I listen to CNBC and I hear all those commentators go on they all assume that the fed is just going to do this no matter what's going on around them and I don't believe that for a minute I think the fed is very focused on\nWhat's going on overseas in overseas markets what's going on in China\nOr what kind of tweets are emerging regarding terrorists and the rest so just sit there and just blindly sell stuff 'cause you assume that the fed dot plots yes correct I think as an error in judgment\n... and ... and when that hasn't been the case I mean if we go back and look over the last decade those dot pots have not been accurate in the key to their conversation has been data dependent\nTo edit mark was saying earlier you know they need headlines they need to talk about something they need to explain today's ... and and the noise that you see on a daily basis and the markets and and frankly the fed is thinking longer term\nAnd in fact the fiscal fiscal policy initiative that the Trump Administration got through which has reinvigorated the economy is giving the fed the opportunity to get rates to more normal levels which will then give them bullets in the event of a a reversal down the road\nThere ... chief investment officer at antics wealth management our website ... wealth dot com just said Tibet hit that get started button we would love to talk to you about a free portfolio analysis\nAnd you can also sign up for the axiom still to come on the show it's Medicare open enrollment season would get a segment coming up about that from our planning department also from our planning department what are the wealth killers in your budget that's all on the way it's money talk antics wealth management W.

financial planner and sci fi here at antics wealth management run welcome back any thanks for having me Danny hits Medicare open enrollment time it's now through what December seventh that's right All right so what does that mean that's a very\nGood question for those that are already on Medicare and have opted to take Medicare Advantage there is an interesting rule that happens once a year in what the rule is is that the insurance companies have an opportunity to change what they cover\nFor instance whether the doctors remained the network how much the deductibles are what prescription drugs that they will cover so they have an opportunity to change it every year in addition to that the rules also state well if the insurance companies have an opportunity to change what they cover in policies they have\nYou also have an opportunity each year to switch policies and not have to worry about preexisting conditions or other\n... writing issues you can just simply switch policies and that happens as you said every year between October fifteenth and December seventh\nSo why why is this important well if you're not paying attention and open enrollment closes your current met uh get Medicare Advantage plan could be completely different starting January first\nWhat you really want to do Danny is you want to review what the changes are and make sure that still going to work for you\nAnd if it's not you need to go the open market now you can do that research yourself but oftentimes we think it makes more sense to bring on a product expert ah there's lots of independent agents out there that can act as if I Do sharing meaning that you don't have\nTo pay them anything and they will look for the best plan for you we think that's probably a really efficient way to go rather than trying to do all the research yourself 'cause there can be a lot\nTo it took and people just take what they did the your previous or be like you said it changes does it change radically every single year\nIt depends on the insurance company really so the default is if you do nothing you're going to keep the same plan you have right now if the plan stays relatively similar then you're okay but sometimes especially prescription drug coverage of it can be a big deal\nSo if you're on a very expensive medication and your insurance plan drops that covered sure stops covering that particular medication then you're going to want to try and find a plan that covers it otherwise it can be very expensive for you and the following year\nBecause of Medicare website is fairly easy to navigate you can get much information sometimes those things are very governmental\nRight well there's tons and tons of resources out on the Internet including\nIt's it's nice when you've got a buffer built that if you can if you want to have a nice house\nBut if it's all you can afford you're expecting that the good times are gonna be ruined forever\nAs saying I like saying yes the one thing and saying no to something else if you're saying yes to the big house you might be saying no to travel or college or retirement sitting down and thinking about what's really important to my wife and I went through this exercise we'd love to travel we take these big trips we bought a little house so that we can take the big trip\nOne of the things is the phone and we both search for some data on this and I'll tell you do you remember the old days we were talking about the cell phones and\nRemember the old days where you can get the phone for a penny yet sets completely changed now so if you go into most of the plans you're getting the brand new iPhone the brand new droid BS nine or whatever it is what you're paying every single month it's a lease so you're paying about Fifteen to twenty bucks extra\nAnd it's a lot like the car you have to have the cutting edge if you have to have the best one rather than just saying does this fit my knees are going to be paying a lot more at a\nVery good friend of mine introduced me to short term I've never heard before but I I get cracks me up it's the ... tax so he says I'm willing to pay their taxes go and buy a brand new iPhone he'll sell that iPhone to somebody else to get it for much deeper 'cause he's got to have the next year on and he goes I'm willing to pay the tax because I have to have the cutting edge\nHere's a tip I'm a big fan of the mid level unlocked phone\nInternal lock phone is that you can get it and it'll work on most networks as soon as you put your sim card in I spend maybe a couple of hundred dollars on a new phone it's not the best one but it's a good one just put the sim card in and it works let's move on to the next wealth killer and that is cable\nCable TV this is a huge one and it's one that's sneaks up on a lot of people because they they make complain about what they're paying on a monthly basis\nBut if you ... put it out a couple of decades people are spending\nTens of thousands of dollars on TV deal on the Internet and with that it can be broken up and most people are spending about eighty five dollars two hundred and thirty five dollars a month unjust cable I'd say you could probably make a better arguments for wanting to have a good Internet and then there's an alternative to the cable\nYou know what happens with that is as we've got it down to about forty seven dollars a month but then Hulu is what eight bucks a month Netflix's eleven dollars a month to see how it adds up to real quick\nMost people are spending about a thousand to twelve hundred dollars a year\nTalking about wealth killers no emergency fund is that a wealth killer\nYeah that was everything else we've talked about is something that is detrimental if you do this is something that's detrimental if you don't do it it's startling how few people actually have an emergency fund thirty four percent of Americans don't have one\nSo something hits where do they find the money\nBorrowing it they're putting another credit card which is another one that will kill you at a study came out just recently that said that forty four percent of people couldn't handle the hundred dollar emergency\nAnd then our final on his lottery tickets and I always thought that that was kind of a luxury for people are fun little thing it's not\nProbably about Fifteen Years ago are reticent surveys but they said that forty percent of people their plan was to win the lottery that was that was what they plan to do ... well I'm going to win the lottery\nAnd win the lottery that was that was what they plan to do ... well I'm going

independent registered investment advisor by investment news every week we help you make sense to your investments retirement Social Security much much more laws\nWe aren't sure your calls and emails now host Bob Richards a nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nBy Bob Richards the guy standing next to me as Andy Smith hey\nAndy it has been quite an October already yeah really quite a year and to to help us sort through all of what's been happening we're going to start to show today with news about a limited time offer for free portfolio review and Social Security optimization report at investing sense dot com\nRight so we're running this limited time offer for a couple of reasons or one\nYou know this recent market volatility might have you reconsidering the risk that you're taking right now and this is important right now so many of you are reaching retirement age the last thing that you want is to delay retirement because of you know any sort of market drop\nTo you know the second reason for us having this limited time offer at investing sense dot com like Bob was talking about I mean it goes back to so many of you reaching retirement age right now many of you could be making a huge mistake by claiming Social Security or planning on taking Social Security to sing\nOr through the show you know we're going to explain how you could be leading lots of Social Security dollars on the table\nIf you're applying are planning on applying the wrong claiming strategy you know in the meantime just cut to the chase learned more plane that free portfolio review that Social Security optimization report to it or if they're investing sense dot com boom\nWhen it comes to reaching a goal like retirement for most Americans that means heading to sources of income source number one is your savings and investments in source number to Social Security and for some American couples the total lifetime benefits from social\nFor some American couples the total lifetime benefits from Social Security can be over a million dollars so would you add that to a nest egg in a four O. one K. or an IRA and maybe a little income on the side and\nWe had been talking about the changing nature of retirement and focusing on the two main sources of retirement income your savings and investments and of course Social Security and so these are the two aspects of today's limited\nTime offer and investing cents dot com and Andy ... one of the reasons why we're running this free offer is because of the risky strategy that some Americans are applying when it comes to Social Security\nYeah so there's a there's kind of a good and bad to this nine you're bull market that's obvious obviously it's great to see the market dude it's doing but\nUnfortunately this nine year ... market has encouraged some Americans to claim Social Security early\nAnd then they turn around and invest the money but the thing is this could be a huge mistake because you know claiming Social Security before your full retirement age actually reduces the amount of money that you could be receiving\nA you can be missing out on what it is yeah it's like basically a guaranteed increase over a couple of years which is what happens when you wait\nAnd you know if you're still working while you claim benefits before full retirement age Social Security is actually going to reduce your benefits even more\nSo I mean think about it you can't get an increase like this than any other investment period and this is from a guy who you know make a living helping you invest in the markets\nAnd why would you want the Social Security administration to take more money away from you with these reductions in benefits simply because you're still working\nAnd I mean really all of us have financial engines are worried\nThat Americans are taking risks that they don't fully understand and that's why for this limited time as part of our offer for free portfolio review will also run a Social Security analysis to personalize you're claiming strategy please get to investing sense dot com learn more and get started here\nNow to give you an example of how important it is to apply to correct claiming strategy\nAnd to explain how sometimes it's difficult to know what that strategy actually is\nWe're thrilled to have ... have joined us on the show titled is a wonderful thing and financial engine he's a senior instructor and he travels around the country teaching people and places like going forward how to better prepare for their future and we've invited to join us to tell a story about his mom\nAnd how he helped her get more out of Social Security when it comes to spousal benefits\nKyle it is great to have you on the show with us today we're all anxious to hear the story that you have to share\nAbout one of your own family members and how they almost left tens of thousands of dollars in Social Security benefits on the table please share that story with us\nAbsolutely Bob my dad started to receive Social Security benefits because of disability in his early sixties my mom's planet always been to delay taking her Social Security benefits until Seventy given are above average life expectancy\nAh you know really I mean just her knowing that kind of puts her a pretty far away from most of the people who know what the different Social Security claiming options are so it's awesome that your mom had this information where did you learn all of her different options here\nWell she had always been a good planner and she definitely done her homework she looked at several different claiming strategies wall factoring in some of her other sources of income\nAnd she basically determine which strategy wouldn't make the most sense for her overall retirement plan now when the bipartisan budget act of two thousand and Fifteen was passed\nEliminating violence to spend with restricted application she assumed that she couldn't claim spousal benefits and that are only option was to wait to turn on her benefit at Seventy and to continue to receive my dad's Social Security benefit as a source of retirement income\nSo ... I I I'd like to have you back up just a second and explain for us you mentioned the bipartisan budget an act of twenty Fifteen explain for us what that is\nAbsolutely the bipartisan budget act of two thousand and Fifteen it changed the rules around the voluntary suspension of benefits so for married couples some would have one spouse file a restricted application\nAt there for a tire me age so that they could claim a spouse full benefit wall allowing their own benefit to grow until age Seventy so for anyone born January second Nineteen fifty four or later\nThat option was no longer available what also happens with these changes is that if you spend your benefits all benefits based upon your record will also be suspended so if your benefits are suspended\nYour spouse can no longer claim of spousal benefits because that benefit would also be suspended here's the part of the bipartisan budget act that my mom overlooked this changed the right to file a restricted application for those born on or after January second Nineteen fifty four\nShe was born in Nineteen fifty two and since my dad was already receiving his Social Security benefit\nShe was still able to use a restricted application so one she reached her fourth term in age and says shit not started taking her own Social Security benefit she could Clinton's spouse will benefit wall letting her own benefit continue to grow\nSo I'll I'll go back again I'm too where you started talking about the the changes you know specifically with Social Security but if your mother\nKnew about violence to spend and restricted application in spousal benefits and everything else my gases that she kind of game planned what the different benefit numbers would have been to her so how much more in benefits you know did she started getting one she filed for this restricted application\nThis was the best part of the entire story as soon as she turned sixty six which was her full retirement age she filed the restricted application and she started to collect nine hundred dollars a month\nAs a spouse will benefit off of my dad's record so this was over forty three thousand dollars that she would have left on the table between the ages of sixty six in Seventy\nAt she and I had this conversation about restricted applications and most importantly about the changes that did and did not affect her because of this bipartisan budget act\nKyle this has been a huge benefits for our listeners have you on the show thank you so much for being with us\nAbsolutely you're very welcome thank you very much for having me on today\nThere was a lot more to Kyle story I Want you to go here that full conversation and investing sense dot com but this story you know really motivates me here and what we're doing right and and for this I Want to speak directly to women\nRight now I still like the guys to play to pay close attention to what I'm about to say I especially if you care about your wives or your partners\nBut Social Security is so important to women and it's because on average at least you know women earn less than men you can find lots of statistics on this but women generally are in about twenty percent less ah for women of color the pay gap is even more pronounced\nThis is why choosing the rights Social Security strategy is so important to women\nAnd the other reasons that Social Security is so important I mean women tend to take more time off to raise children for example ah women tend to accumulate lesson savings women tend to live longer which we talk about all the time on investing sense\nNow about that about that longevity men verses women\nWomen it is vital that you account for life span when you're selecting a Social Security strategy women represent more than half of Social Security beneficiaries in their sixties uh women represent Seventy percent of Social Security beneficiaries in their nineties women make up Ninety seven percent Ninety seven percent\nOf all Social Security survivor beneficiaries you have to be making the right decisions all along now if you even set back a little bit further and think about things that a little bit more global level\nWe've been adjusting climb portfolios we want to reduce risk before we see additional volatility in the markets that volatility alone\nShould've exposed way the Social Security you know claim early and invested strategy just bonkers that's at the global level if you zoom in and the more an individual level it really depends on your unique situation everybody's different\nAnd we saw for those specific differences by getting to know ya okay and by and by providing you with three very important items this is the crux of what this free offer is it's an in person review of your current investments by our local financial engine same\nWay we we build this Social Security analysis I an optimization for you to help you look for ways to to optimize and maximize your lifetime benefit but we put all of this together into a personalized long term financial plan to help you reach your goal\nWill earlier Kyle from financial engines told the story about how he helped his mom get an extra forty three thousand dollars from Social Security just it was a great story I'm is so ... what are some other ways that you help people get more\nLooking if you can wait to claim until Seventy you will increase your annual Bennett\nThe claim until Seventy you will increase your annual benefits you know by what like eight percent of full retirement benefits per year I don't know about you but this guaranteed annual increase is amazing\nBut that's why today that's why we're offering you this free portfolio review with the Social Security announced get over to investing cents dot com as the NFC investing cents dot com and and really just\nGet started on him get to investing cents dot com because the offer expires Monday at ten PM and the oldest is free right are there no one has to pay anything for this personalized long term financial planning and Social Security optimization report right totally\nTotally brain I didn't and I know you know I hear free all these red flags go up there is no catch pay no red flags the only way that you pay is if you like what you hear and and you decide that you could use some help managing your money\nIt if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does draw from the four oh one K. impact Social Security payments suppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and poll sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars in tax Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell ya Larry's got pretty cool story we went back and forth over email the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come to go you've got his reply\nTo yeah he said I plan to retire in the next eight to Nineteen months I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain ... while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's when your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn now\nIf you're younger then full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit your earnings may actually reduce your benefits so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nAre beginning with you guys born in Nineteen fifty five two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches sixty seven for Americans born in Nineteen sixty year later so what\nAre the Dutch and to the benefits in case you reached the earnings limit\nIf you are under full retirement age for the whole year\nSocial Security ... a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow if you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age Social Security ... a dollar and benefits for every three dollars that you earn above the limit for twenty Eighteen that limit is forty five thousand three hundred and sixty dollars but\nThey only count earnings before the month that you reach full retirement age\n[laughter] you got all that no yeah no my head spinning I was trying to keep track I was ... rooms in the right it don't even know it does the first sentence I was okay and then try to keep track of limits an age is just it's unbelievable\nYeah Social Security is just ridiculously complex worst part is all these rules they frequently change so your optimal Social Security claiming strategy could absolutely be a moving target\nThat is how I Am a lot of value to my clients overall wealth picture by making sure that they are optimizing they're claiming strategy but everybody's optimal strategy is different

you have to wait a certain amount of time before you recoup what you would have gotten had you faking it earlier so that's usually about I'd say twelve to fourteen years for for most folks\nSo it doesn't always make sense to wait till Seventy unless you're doing it for a specific reason obviously it's nice to get a guaranteed eight percent growth rate you're not going to find that and\nYou know a CD at the bank right now or something else but a lot of times folks are doing it for like I said earlier tax strategies you know you're in the lowest tax bracket for the most part early on

future\nThat will add more a Social Security dollars to the bucket so they're doing things that they're taking action steps to make sure that Social Security is going to be there\nBut there is a lot of confusion about about it being a roadblock in retirement because you you may not be planning your income needs correctly\nUm so you want to sit down with a financial professional ... somebody that's comfortable working with Social Security somebody that can give you some answers so for instance in the office when you come in we have a program that will go through mathematically what is the most you can get from Social Security\nAre there still spousal benefits available for you what kind of strategies are out there out of the five hundred that a strategy is there are\nAnd then it'll show you if you took it right away how much would you be giving up in the meantime so we can make a plan that's based on you know real numbers but also looking at everything else that you have you know your four one K. your your pensions what tax bracket you're and all that kind of stuff plays it's part of putting those puzzle pieces together\nThen you can make a sound decision on when you should take Social Security because there really is no right or wrong to doing it\nYeah and I think that that that's a ... I think you've nailed that pointed at the end you know I get this question a lot of people say you know when we say the right way to do it\nYou have to understand or some ... to that statement right the right way to do it means if your goal is to get the most dollars and cents on the Social Security\nWe have to make some assumptions right are going to live the life expectancy do you expect to live longer you healthy or there's some conditions and you know it's some of those are uncomfortable questions we have to ask her some conditions that are threatening or health\nHere's their longevity in the family that's not a golden ticket but it certainly can be potentially an indicator you know so we have to analyze our cars were some parts are very great information Tony from Asia bread but I'm taking it now I don't know how long the lip and that's great let's just make a decision and plant around now so\nYou know I I think just having a plan makes a big difference I also read really excited about this new software to use them for folks it's called asset lock\nYou can go right to the app store and you can download that it's a really amazing to or you can wait your your different accounts of security has altered Morningstar so it was very secure\nAnd you can sort of limit you know my accounts are down ... ... whatever number you want to put in it ... it also will send you alert when all beer counts as a whole up his new lifetime hires are what we call the high watermark really great tool or keep uh keep an eye on your accounts doesn't necessarily mean you need to panic and sell\nYou will need a coach so you can download that it's three A.

I think there is\nYou know emotional responses right who wants to think about getting sick who wants to think about one in up in a nursing home who wants to think about you know it's getting some you know horrible life threatening diseases those are uncomfortable topics but I think you know being a financial advisor certified financial planner it's important to plan for that\nAnd and I think for a lot of folks it can be more manageable than you'd think if we can get past that emotional hurdle so talk to us a little bit about some of the health care costs and retirement\nYeah Tony and you're exactly right health care can be very scary going into retirement because you're never sure what exactly is going to happen if you're ever going to need\n'em more money for health care in the future but it is one of the biggest expenses for retirees\nSo the average sixty five year old couple retiring this year can expect to pay two hundred and eighty thousand dollars out of pocket for medical expenses throughout their retirement no that's not including long term care which is just crazy because the prices of long term care are skyrocketing every year\nUm so you know Medicare is designed to cover many of your health care costs in retirement but it's not meant to cover everything so it's estimated that Medicare is only going to cover about fifty to sixty percent of retirees healthcare needs and premiums out of pocket and premiums out of pocket expenses go up overtime\nSo long term care is also on the rise like I said and that's an average cost of long term care is now more than Ninety seven thousand dollars a year it's going up at four point three percent per year so it's important to get out talk to a financial professional about long term care insurance because you know it's not the right fit for everybody and you just want to make sure that fits into your plan\nI'm so a typical policy will help pay for adult daycare rest by care in a season ... a specialty care facilities assisted living facilities and nursing homes that hospices\nYeah you know and you can you bring up some good points you know long term care is certainly\nYou know a scary topic I think for folks you know and there's different ways just ice that apple right sometimes is traditional long term care insurance and\nWell the big thing we're in the we're currently in the longest Bull Run on record right but history shows bull markets cannot last forever and that means we need to be prepared you know it's really crucial for those in or near retirement to protect themselves from stock market risk\nUh your portfolio should be diversified number one and your risk tolerance should be appropriate for your age so when we experience volatility on Wall street\nIt's easy to let emotions are like fear take control so we always encourage our clients to avoid any knee jerk reactions based on the market\nYeah and I think there's a couple of things we can keep in mind when it comes to ... but you know before I jump in and out I think there's some very tools nowadays right one tool when you come in for those three sixty evaluation we're going to use\nIs a great software program where you answers or series of questions and assigns you with a risk or the neat part once we have that starting point as we can enter all of your holdings in your portfolio\nAnd then we can start to analyze from our risk perspective argue lined up with what you're comfortable with and oftentimes answer is no I Would say the majority of people that come in a semi risk ... is that acts but their portfolios or why right\nAnd so that begs the question you know why the discrepancy do we need to make a judgment is it OK that it's there it's just our conversation piece right\nBut then we could take that and we can stress tests the portfolio we can simulate bad decades bad market good market periods right because we know aggress report fully going to do well sometimes but we have to accept the downside risk them right it's a two sided coin that comes together so I think that's a great tool\nUm that that we can help folks would there be coming to the officers no cost or obligation we can help you analyze your risk there and then there's another tool abroad that were really excited about that we're making available to listeners into our clients\nAnd it's a tool called asset lock and it's a simple app you download on your ... everybody else's smartphones nowadays writes you will need a code if you plug in a cold there's no cost to it but you can download the code is three eight hour snaps three A.

on retirement ready with Tony drink on WGM Jay\nGood afternoon and welcome back to the retirement ready show on WGM Jerry I'm Tony drug certified financial planner with drinking associates wealth Wisconsin dot com dot map test and Brad Allen here to there we\nGo to a good priority right everybody wants to talk about numbers of flaring up everybody's late but\nI uh we had our classes out their bread or a girl universe rarely a couple of great group smells really really great questions and ah\nAlthough the one or the brewers are planted there as a tough one and a little distracted I and and tell them but it but I have my para going into back with the game on sale I stood up and cheer to silence and they wonder why beer but the\nBut Greg Greg group and um\nYou know I I I think some of these great questions came up that that we're talking about here\nAnd you know we're talking about hurdles and retirement you know in in an upcoming as this month his national retirement security we can I think one of those hurdles the stock market volatility right and we're talking about some rarest kind of analyze risk different tools to help you with that but\nI think there's a couple of things in mind that to protect your retirement for volatility\nAnd one thing is timing right I mean there's that concept of thinking long term a lot of investors who stuck with the long term plan through what economists refer to as the great recession\nContinue to save money and they were to great shape break 'cause even we talk about that sixteen month period you know oh nine to shoot ... told and I were to market essentially cutting have you know but\nIf you think a bit from a different angle you know if you're barred good companies they were on sale they're fifty percent discount and so if you were sticking money one year four one K. and buying ended up those low points\nYou know bread you talked about this longest bull market running history sauce going pretty tremendous growth there so you know they're in a lot better shape those who continue to contribute really suit tripled their account balance on average from two thousand seven to two thousand and Seventeen so\nIf you consider numbers you know the average baby boomers four one K. balance was a hundred and Fifteen thousand in June of ...\nThe average balance ... eighty five thousand to begin to about nine and then rose to three hundred and Fifteen thousand by June seventeenth so it's always about timing right so\nThat's a great strategy if you have time on your side right is what what what you know you might refer to as a you know a long term strategy you're just not worrying about the short term fluctuations right but\nIf you're rapidly approaching retirement it becomes a little bit different so it's all about timing and that's something we're talking about the classic thing we gave a couple of examples of some different couples we have a story about two brothers right they retire and different decades of experience different you know quote unquote average rates of return\nAnd uh the Dodgers will counter with Walker viewer I'd be shocked if you didn't see Clinton curse all tonight and I would also expect to see kind of like dancing that tonight\nAnd uh I that might be at this could be a low scoring game here as both teams have the best of the best available tonight in terms of pitching so there'll be a storyline to watch here who makes the first moved to the piano\nAnd for how long it will be able to mount divide such a fascinating game seven on the air force somebody here at Miller Park enjoy it soak it in\nAppreciate what these Milwaukee Brewers have done to\nHopefully it's just getting started to celebrate in the clubhouse later tonight will set aside for the news

J. cares presented by first bank financial center\nDon't wrap things up here are final segment on the road to brew October presented by associated bank\nOf right and that's what you're inside Miller Park grounds crew at work it in the field for baseball will have first pitch to know about forty minutes or so from inside Miller Park you'll lead shot scene Walker below you're starting pitchers denied first got the viewer in game three\nData Los Angeles and I was a day where the shadows were definitely affecting things have to play a lot of strike out during that three game series in Los Angeles\nBut the brewers ultimately got the viewer they tap on in the first dealing with Ryan Braun hitting a double into the left field gap\nIn ah west center gap and then later in the game or ... what the key to run home run it and I I think the thing that really stands out with that home run talking to are the after the game he said look it was the third time I saw him he picks me a very similar to sequence the bad prior\nYeah that was just keep up on that sequencing you follow the sequence do with the need to beep\nPray that that's what this game is about tendencies and picking up all the pictures putting down get a third time in the wind up it's the fate it's definitely a thing we saw David Freese well he got the weight Miley early last night but he also hit his third at bat wasted double double I feel gap so that was a run scoring opportunities because\nWell familiarity freezer the Hitler pitchers rather well and uh luckily that's just kind of all stopped after that till seven to the final yesterday\nWas a murder that game six when the wind up I think it's a very interesting to the Dodgers that you've got a pair of what these back at the top and Dr Peterson and ... ... ... another lefty who will bear fifth\nTonight and I really none of these guys have done much of anything this series ... one Seventy two Cody Ballenger a betting one twenty five but I Do have a big hit course in that game or in Los Angeles a walk off when but\nIt was really not done much of anything at the plate so uh it some opportunities here I Hope for brewers basically to keep things quiet\nThe Dodgers side of things but they do have a deep bench as well so plenty of position players gods like Matt Kemp and David Freese either good players even come off the bench in it to the game but any time he was ... ... dollars really struggled at the theories behind the plate more so than have to play ball though it's not really been pretty at either scenario\nBrian does or another veteran Vatican come off you know to get a swing here for Dave Robert so uh both teams come into this game I think it's very similar position you've got a full stable of arms at your disposal\nAnd the brewers case they have their best most consistent start of the season on them out and\nThey've got a rookie going for Los Angeles but he's not just any rookie is twenty four years old and it's got electrified stuff it's a matter of trying to get him early and ah maybe run up to pitch got a little bit if you're the brewers ...\nThe biggest thing that I saw from the brewers off its last night that I thought was missing and other point to the series especially on the road\nWith the ability to go the other way Pacers Aguilar had three hits last night they all went to the opposite field I thought that was remarkable\nAguilar was definitely in a funk and uh we were picking on their show boy do you have to give you arrested you find a spot for Curtis Granderson maybe move Ryan Braun to first base\nHow you just wonder could Aguilar get out of that whole ... they weren't even throw them strikes if he was fighting him self on the bench after a few pitchers so his approach last night in the brewers approach in general I thought that first did it get specially\nWas outstanding you had a lot of opposite field based hits and that was critical for runs beings quarter to out so I thought was also remarkable it'll last night's game and a six to seven runs with the brewers scored last night came to out so\nYou get done when they had to do it and are impressive with runners in scoring position where the brewers last night they have not been really at any point throughout the series until last night when it mattered most\nWhen now what matters most what you did last night really that doesn't make much of a difference it's all about what happens tonight you know hopefully these nine innings\nOf baseball going to step aside for the news here on WGM Jay we do have Bobby courage up ... standing by with a network pre game coming up following ... minutes brewers baseball from Miller Park first pitch set for seven to nine several times before we get to the news and great

screener I think it's kind of a joke with again I'm fine\nI Would like to see major league baseball thrown out if it happens again you think about pitcher can brush somebody back and not even hear them and getting yeah yeah you know here's this guy is intentionally trying to hurt somebody [noise] but\nUnfortunately I don't think it really matters I mean people are very few teams today Milwaukee being an attraction that looks at the character of the players I mean people will be glad to give him a great baseball player and overlook all that other crap\nYeah thanks for the call Steven here's a deal about many Machado he's all about many Machado yeah he's playing for one of the best teams in baseball he's not going to be playing for their team next year probably so there's no loyalty there was no respect for your opponent\nI Know some folks don't think that's a big deal any more of a ... but when you throw sportsmanship respect for your opponents doing it the right way which it seems to be standards that have just been crumbling whether you're talking about sports politics or whatever\nI guess you get what you do with these people acting like lunatics on a baseball field isn't that much different than I can with a lunatic in real life with politics or anything else let's take one more before we go to break Rick from Lake Geneva you end up ...\nHey Steve I agree with the prior call a that anybody can get shot out as loving baseball them play three strikes and you're out he had three strikes or infants as we're walking brewers players that theory\nDuck or the official uh uh the heads of a major league baseball they should have noticed all there and said hey you're out you're out you're suspended for the rest of the season or something like that I\nI I don't think they would do that given the gravity of the series the weight of this is the fact that the Dodgers are trying to go back to the world series and thanks for the call rich but what I Do think it's going to happen if he does anything else in game six or hopefully game seven he's gonna get tossed out I Would be shocked if that didn't happen because you cannot try to injure your opponents\nWhether it's sliding into second base whether it's trying to take the legs out from under the surface and you are at first base that can't happen All right we'll take more calls in tax next manual shot or what should happen to this guy is a dirty player\nMore on that story right here in the ... democratic leaders we can to state representative jail quaint of addressing the state assembly while drunk Jerry ... protests Wagner any has new information on that story today at twelve ten ...\nWe're talking many Machado I have a little bit of a quotes I was reading the story about it's\nA um one of the reporters yesterday I asked him about this a discipline from the major league baseball the ten thousand dollar sign this is what he said I'm not talking about that I'm trying to play baseball when asked me in baseball question we'll talk about interesting he doesn't want to talk about it if it's your actions\nYour conduct on the field if you're gonna do it on its you what you should have said if you believe it was there was nothing\nIt's it's your actions your conduct on the field\nIf you're going to do it all gets you should have said if you believe it was there was nothing wrong there there was a baseball player I did I did when I was supposed to do you couldn't even own his own actions that's ... what kind of a person may Machado was let's go to Mike calling from Westchester, Illinois good morning Mike\n[noise] yeah they say my God I think we're just way too much\nAll right do you think he's a dirty player\nOr do we lose we lose Mike all\nRight we lost Mike what am I supposed to be talking about it too much you know what I disagree with the reason I wanted to talk about it is because I think we're getting to a point in this country where people including athletes don't know how to conduct themselves anymore sportsmanship out the window conduct on the field out the window\nAnd title minutes\nYeah he's a great baseball player one of the best in the major league baseball does that mean he doesn't have to follow the rules that that means you can try to injure other players as part of the game I don't think so let's go to David in Dallas he'll drink WGM Jay morning David\nGood morning said thanks for taking my call what do you think they are weighing in on me and my God oh you're very poor behavior on it but I think it goes a little bit beyond\nI've been watching the games and the Dodgers\nA as a whole have been very poor in terms of their conduct\nAfter striking out or after a ... you know flooding around and get fine we've seen a picture her all the candy and drop that I'm Lauren Frayer in\n... in fact on your way back to the dugout and quite honestly it's not a very ... like peanut part I returned I'm\nVery proud of the ... I mean the way we conduct themselves they struck out because there are a lot and\nThey walked back in the dugout and and that's it they conduct themselves in a perfect romance\nAnd the way that we can take care of management cattle and I'm a St Louis I mean uh yeah uh well while fans of Dodgers if this afternoon on an in following game let's wrap this thing and let's take care of those guys\nThat's so unfortunate when you've got young children that are watching this I'm all excited about it and then you see that type of\nBehavior coming on a on national TV it's a disgrace to the\nRight things for the call David I I Will agree with you on one thing I Know I I don't I'm not going to call it the other\nPlayers and the Dodgers there comes a highly competitive I think that's just the way that are most athletes deal with that stuff but there's a distinct difference between bats and what many Machado doing he's trying to injure other players through his conduct on the field and\nIf you don't think that's the case look at the places again one of the ... uh challenges me Chinese replay or are you serious like every time a pitcher brushing the batter back\nIt's not the same thing as part of baseball the things that many Machado was doing I don't think are part of baseball let's give a joy from Milwaukee we've got about thirty seconds ... what do you think\nJoy from Milwaukee going once\nAlready know calling from Georgia so let's just concluded with is the brewers can do it on the field Saturday hopefully a friday hopefully Saturday as well that'll shut up many Machado\nMaybe the fans would give him a the the kind of cheers I say that ... that he deserves for his conduct that'll be part of the great atmosphere that is Miller Park if you don't say this is is this is the combination of the season at least as far as trying to get to the world series\nThis weekend is zips so much at stake\nOr die games with a great Markey as the\nCaller said a classy Milwaukee team that does just the right way fun stuff we aren't the cubs we aren't the Dodgers were the Milwaukee Brewers so let's let's get a couple of wins after the break after the news we're going to go to ...
