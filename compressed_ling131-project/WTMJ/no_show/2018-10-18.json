{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "That was it was interesting point but made by a device and we talked about this yesterday you can get away with it if you've done it for years yeah something like the governor who is being seen him in a park before has been wearing the Jersey before he can get away with continued to root for the team but if your candidate who's never done that before\nThey actually need a it's a delicate balance because you don't want to come off like that person he's faking it even if you're not really\nYeah fake is the word there the key word I'm just real quickly on politics one of the textures nine to oh I'm a mailman to search in Maine it bothers me I have to deliver those those ads total garbage I I agree with him they are garbage\nI'm coming up in the eleven o'clock hour or some interesting topics where is that what this one I've I've kinda shuffled my line of a little bit but there's a lot of a big school referendum all across the states um and I want to kind of detail some of the numbers are startling how big a number of the citizen total\nAnd I guess my question is this the new normal in our school district they're all in some of these projects some of these referendum\nAre four in the case in Tulsa for new grade school elementary schools they're just saying basically we went all new stuff\nWe got a great city Tulsa is a great city we went on this stuff you're going to pay for it here's a referendum passes and it's not just hosted so creek Oregon, Wisconsin is I've got some examples of that well I spend a little time on that subject is this the new normal\nIs it going to be all about school districts I've said critically about school districts and school boards you want to see run away salaries look to your school district\nLook to your school district most local governments have had to tighten the belt not the case with school districts they've exploded their salaries I use the example of our time leader in a city of make a hundred and twenty thousand a hundred thousand there'll be ten people on the school district\nPayrolls to make that amount of money from the top down superintendent on down that's where the or the waste is so we spent some time on nine eleven o'clock hour and also are you being silent because of politics politics make you hold back and kind of dinner conversation parties or elsewhere that's\nAll coming up next hour cease to be with you on this Wednesday right here in the teenager morning Wisconsin eleven\nBears is you know\nKnow I was saying about this I saw ... coffee in a\nWhat's your name Megan Kelly has brought her mom okay so\nI'm thinking my parents listen to the show they would love to have ever been down that W changes as far as I Know they would love to do that so I'm not doing a different\nDay yeah you can celebrate any non take your parents work day day\nYeah I think that if you get a kick out of it and I think I told you the sort of saw before back in my dad's day when he was a meteorologist from National Weather service WGN Jay news department would play his National Weather service recording on the weather man he was on our airwaves in the sixties and\nCenter has we bring it back oh because it could find that these ... or maybe we have 'em do alive when for\nHim and he always tells me my my dad who was an awesome guy tells me that she did it before they had computers were real forecasting back then but I said well did you just called Minneapolis and say hey whatsoever\n[laughter] coming our way that's good enough but no yeah those those guys were time my dad is now I think he's he's been retired longer that he's been there and he works for the national weather service got to be close so shuttled to my parents and take your parents to work day I I didn't bring them in but maybe it's some future date don't have to bring them\nAll right so I wanted to talk about the topic of people have been asking about about referendum is there's a lot\nOf them out there how do I know that so I told this story and it's if this was really a Madison sorry I'm up to the school districts out there at the Oregon school district and middle to the school district but in that story\nThe number associated with referendum for school districts in November hold onto your hats one point four billion dollars one point for Bill you\nAs my friends got more of the same building which will be no you wouldn't say that 'cause he hates that when people do that but\nThat's the total some examples Middleton hundred and thirty eight point nine million Oregon forty four point nine there just a few examples aren't I pulled out while which also remember six hundred and twenty four point nine million dollars in referendum value\nOr the or do they say the aging\nSchool district ... creek city I Know very well Seventy million I Believe is the number associated with their referendum question\nSo why are we seeing this I was just a couple of things going on here one what do you live in a community whether it's also creek Oregon middle son I was just in Middletown recently great great community\nThe\nSchool district the prestige\nAnd the performance of the school district actually can raise home values can make people feel better about their community it's also a lot of things can be source of community pride I get all that\nBut what the gamble is that I think most school systems are making that when you when you see ... number like one point four billion dollars that Wisconsin schools going to be asking\nFor in the form of referendum in November how much is too much and is this the new normal in Wisconsin for one for seven nine nine one six twenty anybody little one of those communities Middleton Oregon Sosa ...\nWhere do you think I've seen a little bit of detail on the Oak Creek one involves some a separation because a lot of the grade school elementary school share lunchroom space and Jim space they want to separate those two things and develop some separate facilities that involves a performing arts center\nNoble goals which should be on the back of the taxpayers middle son one of the more expensive ones a hundred and thirty and point nine million new elementary school renovations middle to high school\nBuilding a cafeteria edition of park elementary remodeling Clark street community school an additional ... million on staffing\nAnd operational expenses for the new and expanded facilities that's a hundred and forty three million dollars on the they requested a hundred and thirty or nine even in a referendum so that's just one example\nWhere do you think for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I'll tell you what I think\nSchool districts and I understand the power and the role at school districts playing community I'm not questioning that they do great work to do tough work I'm married to a teacher one of the toughest jobs nowadays if teaching high school kids\nAnd we we know that because we've seen a failing performance I'm going to be doing a story next week on the uh this new notion of grading where if you don't take\nA test if you don't turn a paper in you don't get a zero you get a fifty\nAnd how that's dealing a performance results in our state and everything that's good news for our schools\nI don't think so I think it's a challenging way to look at that and I and I understand I understand why they're doing it there seems to me a momentum among school districts that suggests we're going to go forward referendum\nPrice be damned and I'm and I made this point before let's go to Chris in Milwaukee or there'll be changing it money Chris\nMorning how are you today good what do you think well\nI my ... I have a tree older children I have a five older children\nAll the five older children went through parochial school are through ... almost ... my younger ones are in parochial school what ice sheet in my opinion is the public schools are soon the amount of money that you've parochial schools are dumping in to their programs and skill that they want to ... their game off\nI'm from a common walk 'em and I've seen how the public schools here have dumped a tall are the money into the public schooling and it does\nShe want to raise the bar for the public school system\nDo you think it's a good idea that they're there requesting in in your referendum on the ballot in November\nAt one point four billion dollars collectively\nI Do think it's a good idea children our future I'm not saying that there there are not things that could be cut from that request but I think that it takes a group all of a\nScholar people to be able to look at those numbers break them down um the palatable things that we can all understand\nBecause one point for all you bring up a great point that's a lot of freaking money um dumping the school system\nUm that being said you would want to see scored cast numbers go up you would want to see a graduation rates go up\nUm and even in the elementary schools to get get parents more involved with the school system issue rather than parents blaming the school's children's problems\nAll right thanks for the call Christmas some great points their Christmas is a supporter of the idea is to take a quick break after the break more of your calls\nIn tax school districts a record officer record but at one point four billion dollars of\nNew referendum is related to new buildings performing arts centers staffing\nNew programs is it the right thing to do and it's just a new normal in Wisconsin It's certainly seems we're heading that direction more your calls in touch these could be with you on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay\nSong selection their young on the wrong people are going to be relatively having these referendum one point four million dollars in the state of Wisconsin Honda about on the number six\nIn a sense of what Americans are thinking about the issues and this one has to do as a I've had to sneak bill so much for at least the last six months civility in politics communicating effectively with each other and I and I've ... I've told you on the air there are people that I have\nLess friendly relationships now because of one what I Do and to what I say and I took I Try to be as fair and balanced as I can in coming from a conservative viewpoint of course and I offered times to Democrats if you don't take it I'm not really my fault but we we do that with Tammy Baldwin\nAnd others so the offer still stands up there she or any of the other democratic has to come on happy to have you have a civil honest conversation civil and honest about the issues that you talk about and the the the substance of your campaign\nSo in the world of politics we see that side of it we see the candidates the parties the politicians elected official at whatever level you're talking about dominating the narrative\nTelling us\nUnfiltered as in my case of Donald Trump or filtered the words of palaces of Donald Trump filtered through the eyes of the CNN or MSNBC or a Fox and that's the reality of the world we live in but there's a great piece in the ... in the Washington Post and it's it is titled only get your thoughts on this\nWe're staying silent out of fear\n\n... I'm not gonna be the whole thing but part of it only among trusted family and friends as a possible speaks speak one's mind if even that was not guaranteed he's talking about life in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union all aspects of totalitarian life citizens the former eastern bloc say this is the hardest to explain that those are those who grew up in the Democratic west until now perhaps\nA new study of political attitudes in the United states offers studying evidence that most Americans censored themselves\nExcept among people they regard as like minded on a bundle of sensitive topics immigration and immigrants race and racism gay lesbian and gender issues and Islam and Muslims\nReports called more in common and it uh is set up to understand potentially Shia political polarization the United states and Europe is based on a nationwide survey of nearly eight thousand people um and the numbers were gathered in December and January and the last year beginning of this year\nAnd it found that between fifty one percent and sixty six percent two thirds agree there's pressure to take a certain way about each of the information topics when immigration seen as the least sensitive and his line of the most\nSixty eight percent reporter that's acceptable for me to express what I think about race or Islam only among people who are like me\nOn immigration Seventy three percent felt that way on gay lesbian transgender issues the figures Seventy percent\nAnd reading back from the story political freedom has never been an absolute in the United states to be sure for much of them most of our history ostracism or worse away to advocate for racial equality especially in the south if anyone understands the oppressive missile being forced to visit a false front everyday it'd be the American game and lesbians who grew up in the area of the closets\nConversely a certain measure of self censorship is necessary to democracy do these things that people refrain from gratuitously broadcasting bigotry it promotes trust in rational this ...\nSo what do they fear not necessarily government repression but ridiculing harassment from their fellow citizens\nWhich is often magnify this is the key point to your my words by social media sometimes even the trouble at school or work large majorities of the public eighty percent or more see both hate speech and political practice as problems plaguing American politics\n\nIn the United states for the right and left wing tribes progressive activists loaded conservatives in force core beliefs within our own ranks a quarter to a third of Americans feel\nPressure to think a certain way about controversial issue even among people like themselves\nWhat do you think think about your own circumstances\nWe've all probably been at a party or neighbor gathering or even a work events although work as a little little more filter because there are certain that you can't talk about at work but does it give you pause when a subject comes up politics or gender issues or even the me too movement so that it's safer and I think this is what the study showing\nSome that's put yourself out there I'll give you a specific example as a conservative radio host I often share stories that I read things I'm building a future segment a show on on social media specifically Twitter\nYou can find me a WTO ... even if you're interested\nAnd then I'll hear from liberals\nFriends of mine saying how dare you share that story and I I've often thought about doing what some people do on social media putting a retreat does not necessarily constitute endorsement but really do I have to\nIt's an interesting time because we're all opinionated we all have ideas about things and some of the issues I talked about on that piece in the Washington Post\nImmigration immigrants racism and my closest shows a little bit on the shore with high school decision to not staged a plane that's really what that is they can filter the way they want but that's what it is but do you censor yourself or one four seven nine nine once he's twenty I kind of mortgage talk and ...\nWhat do you think are you are you limiting your conversation based on what you think the reception to your comments might be and those that ultimately dumb down our conversation that comes to politics or any of the issues of the day I'll take your calls in Texas next\nForty two degrees at Radio City course we're all gearing up for the big brewers game this afternoon game find brewers Dodgers from Los Angeles\nAs I said I'll take your calls in text messaging WGM J\nJust because the Packers office really doesn't mean you can't you wait and Larry in fact you hear this was the first time sort of on Sundays or an annual factors classic broadcast takes you back to the very first game together since\nThe raiders of the package from land will feel all the way back to Nineteen Ninety nine waning Larry's first broadcast CEO this Sunday at noon on WGN gee how cool is that\nWay in and Larry\nLarry saying yes and no very enthusiastically it's part of the broadcast I'm just ... and I love Larry in Wayne kind of listen to them as much as I can uh we're talking about\nCensoring yourself really in conversations with friends family on social media got a bunch of tax and some calls as well Jeffrey Sachs points I have avoided politics and working by and for a while but I recently expanded this policy to social media\nRecently to friends were discussing politics out of brewers game and I was nervous an argument would ensue if someone around us that's I've heard that before from people\nKevin from mosquito I've been keeping quiet about politics not out of fear but for the fact that it seems everyone is completely dug it on the issues I can still have civil discussion with friends and family but as far as changing someone's opinion it just isn't going to happen\nBill from a kind of walk we can call her to the program as well I for one will not be silence I'm not afraid to speak my what his arm and minds of any one\nAnd a and they won five I'd done it down as they don't want to get into a fight for the for the same people fight with others say no win situation when should should have\nOr could have been a healthy discussion you just can't have a different opinion that said these days I'm Mike from Port Washington I keep my mind I've offended family and friends but if you don't stand up for your beliefs what does that say about use some good good cross section there about how this conversation is playing out or lack of conversation in our country\nLet's go to Jenny in butler your eyes will be team Jay good morning Jenny\nMartin ... that's a great topic um [noise]\nI Can't play or ... or more a matter of fact I got my both for taking my time I ever loan ... I Hope my brother in law how um people that I Would change my own who I hung out with\nA ... he knows me and I read or I go home line I haven't looked around for twenty five year it how ... how many do not really I'm\nVery embarrassed I put on April ... ... ... ... ... ... on TALK here all their money out of\nMy ... um it's kind of amazing time we're in where we have all these tools to do okay but yet we can't communicate anymore\nNo it it just shows you how [noise] you know millennia Trump for every ... for fiber ball\nPark and get him out a play on the media she felt right about what\nFor every ... pounds for cyber bullying parking came out a play on the media\nShe is so right about what she has one of them are telling people you spoke you know and my truck from mouth to bring more of them I don't ... they are so Kagame bears felt with both of my in my opinion the only one that can you make me but\nI Want to you I Want from your side or\nThe trip so tired of people and you're like okay I've gone through I had actually gotten writer fine because I come out here from one sided refused to sign up for that now\nYeah it's an interesting time and it it it certainly plays out thanks for the call Jamie calling from butler and it plays on his social media loudly and clearly\nA I had the ... people are just because of the fact that they were so over the top I don't like to anybody but\nLet's keep it within reason I'm expressing an opinion is I'm generally a pretty reasonable gun reasonable rational conservative and I don't I'm not going to put anything hateful out there I may disagree with you on policy has a conservative but that should that inspire hatred coming back I mean I don't think so just go to bill in her senior that'd be changing your morning bill\nAs a tough guy and it got us really passionate about baseball I think he's given a lot of teams in major league baseball pause and say we want this guy and a roster so do you plan Kim this afternoon I Hope they don't do that because it's not going to help anything and frankly uh adding base runners to the the series is not a good idea don't forget\nFirst run the Dodgers score yesterday walk\nThe it was a rough start to that game too many free basis as many free base runners to the to the Dodgers by Bruce pitchers at least ... I was just started that\nYeah I agree with you but I think they wanted to I think he ends up on first base leach once during the game today just because teachers are going to want to defend their ...\nLives if that happens I was surprised that the Fisher got tossed you'd better be be ready to lose the pitcher unless it's a it's something that seems really innocuous 'cause it it would be a pretty startling to pay back by the brewers related to what happened last night we're going to obviously spend a lot of time the brewers today and after the break going to take your calls for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nWhere do you say 'cause this guy puck or is it just a guy plenty tough baseball I I'm I'm more in the punk camp I Want to get what you got four months four seven nine once he's twenty just quick run down on the show lots to talk about say eleven o'clock hour there's a lot of controversy about the movies first man\nAnd there's a piece that I read a on NBC News dot com is this an example of American hubris or exceptionalism and there's a ... it's a strong peace because the questions the reasoning of the reasons why we went to space in the first place and I'm going to disagree\nWith the writer that these protests upcoming able to live in a seven eleven thirty five I've been wanting to talk about this one this one for a while Americans are staying silence\nBecause of politics the rewarding conversations unless they feel you know I can save group of of like minded people just politics make you whole back that's come April Evan thirty five or six four ... four biggest stories as we see across Milwaukee to state in the world with a lot of brewers in their\nCanada making it official now recreational marijuana two thousand and one they made medicinal marijuana legal\nTwenty Eighteen recreational marijuana you think half the population cameras walking out walking around high right now here we are yeah [laughter] I heard some of the reports earlier today yeah there are few\nYeah I I Would imagine they're having some uh some intended us we'll we'll spend a little bit of time on that\nAnd uh we'll take a call after the break for one for seven nine one six twenty brewers is this guy puck many Machado or just a really tough aggressive ballplayer we'll get to those calls in text messaging to be seen as you\nMentioned in the morning the brewers two minutes of the world series and just being really go even farther jump right and I think the answer is yes your explanation as well tendency I guess we'll find out they have a [noise] two games to win in the series to them or at home big big game in Los Angeles later on today uh we're talking about\nMany Machado got a lot of checks and a lot of\nCalls so we're going to get to those calls in the second Andy from walking shot why does that major league baseball get involved until the Dodgers she does this again he sent me for the next game suspend them\nThree or four incidents in the last couple of games that's ridiculous I'm Steve ... from ... says I'm Glad we didn't get him or\nHe also says the word I Can't say on the radio a day from west and name calling now they should get a two game misconduct\nOf the two six two I only knew his numbers never watched them play I'm Glad the brewers and not pick him up because he's embarrassing to a ballpark and the team he's a great player but the two ... two slice in a second poor sportsmanship on first yesterday\nAnd hitting many opinion they had in the second game and his father's thing makes me not have too much too good to say about him let's go to Jerry in Milwaukee you're on the team Jake morning Debbie\nMartin I Can't ... you know I really got into a half years and for me to hang out at all of the ... on that one killer guy I Can't imagine what all the\nYou know long term fans will probably see more than I've seen in my mind is not a brewer because there's no way he could be ... ever\nAnd now with the family or type amateur they have around this Columbus what do you think should they plunk um today with a pitch\nAbsolutely no get ain't got [laughter]\nMakes ... they'll be calling from Milwaukee let's go to Cathy in ... year and the beauty and taken my Kathy\nCan lane I think you're I think Iran getting I think he should be fun to watch 'em\nAnd that was talking to your previous her uh we live in a society that we are politically correct well and and we have first impressions like the old adage how you look and how you conduct yourself you know life can pressure when I first saw him like a month ago as you know it's like a\nA R kids look up to the players as heroes as someone they worship and these kids are going to turn it dirty ballplayers south and I I ... it's the whole impression that I have about him as awful\nYeah I'm going to do what it might be interesting to hear what the Joe Buck and John Smith said in the broadcast afternoon or because we have roughly four incidents in this for game series now we have to have a little like really poor sportsmanship\nAggressive behavior on the he's passed which frankly I'm no place in baseball 'cause we're all supposed to be friends he's friends with some of the brewers players and not seeing\nThat and I've also seen the way he looks at the camera and don't exactly what he's doing exactly\nSo you're saying oh ... oh you got that right\nThanks for the call Kathy let's go to Julie and I couldn't OSHA your other beauty and Jake money Julie\nI'm angry at him and\nI you know that it's okay and I feel like I Can't I

we lose Julie already lost you up Jewish or with the British punk come on at the game today\nBecause you know my mom moved far away you know he don't matter by going on\nRight good stuffed Julie thanks for the call let's go quickly to Michael in Chicago where do you think Michael\nHow are you know here's the thing I actually have the reverse take on that I think that I'm a little bit tired of friends in baseball you're playing a game when you're between the lines I I don't think anything he's done his that agree just if you look at a large but without innovate he clearly did not get off it's one of those things are you what kind of\nYou know having a little contact with him that he was a contest back into the things that you're you're gonna get you to look like that belong to the same thing so ours as well you know it's just that the game was played or that's what it used to be played and now it's not and so when it does happen people you know\nYou ... are you a Bush fan Michael I Am a brewers fan right so you're going to say no problem there\nI I think that when I think that when people start calling him up are hitting the catcher in the follow through when I seen it probably Seventeen higher than the ... league championship series I think that's ridiculous I think that's a bit of spoiled milk and just\nJust play the game you know what I mean it really gave the Dodgers are clearly out playing the Dodgers and they've only one to a foreign country should be up that would not whether he picks his hands up 'cause he thinks the towards the fall on them at these like that can be\nVery good you sound like a punch them in the comments\nFrom Michael calling from Chicago has a different take on it I Know a lot of people want to weigh in for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I can emerge talking tech site\nIs many Machado a punk or just playing some good aggressive ... what are we going to find out this afternoon was a brutal stretch going to be in game five as they try to take any series lead back to Miller Park\nThis weekend where do you think for one for seven nine nine wants to take your calls and read your text used pretty what's up with you on this Wednesday happy\nIt's a Miller Park this weekend where do you think for one for seven nine nine wants to take your calls and read your text used pretty what's up with you on this Wednesday happy I'm the everybody thirty nine degrees at Radio City playoff baseball can't give anything better than that more\nNaturally into museums or after an unfortunate five hours Thursday to any games were lost in Los Angeles version dies or back into the game plan less than twenty four hours later\nThe series is all square games apiece as hall of famer Bobby ... Khan once again and our coverage starts at two o'clock this afternoon the big ballgame important ... got to get the free to gene that does that great position to win the best of seven series we're talking about many Machado a couple of text before I get to the caller's a look at how he carries himself reminds me another\nManny Ramirez body language and how you carry yourself as a lot about being a professional\nOr from the for one for blood coming to pick off move that's might be in Bay view or let's go to Sandy and my nominee falls rather be changing a morning Sandy\nHi guys uh Brooklyn or in the living in Milwaukee forty years given I'm from Brooklyn I Am a Dodger fan don't cut me off well no no no no\nLet me support the brewers fan I revel in the tradition that in the class of the dot your organization as I say you end up or organization players in front of\nHim when I look at Jackie Robinson and Sandy Koufax at camp for an hour or or I won't go through the day you got you're still there this guy is embarrassing to me\nShe clearly I if I Would love to see Robert sleep them all the world series rock there if they get there if we both teams have a great chance but I I I Do hope they don't sign him this off season\nThe Dodgers also like the ... look or chemistry and they have a family feel the city's different Los Angeles doesn't walkie right I Choose to live in Milwaukee but they are class organization too and they don't know I'd be shocked and disappointed if they\nBe a little bit from it and then you can weigh in as well if you'd like for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nI tried the our nothing wrong with the governor has failed we've had success on gun violence and policing through collaboration and shared ideas this month Supreme Court cycle is not America's finest hour\nRegardless of how you feel about Brett Kavanaugh you'd probably agree with the whole serves bunnies or democratic institutions it's hard to see it any other way people are angry torn apart by the zero sum game that they've seen playing out not just a record nomination but in virtually every other public policy debate an election campaign zero something means I win you lose\nIt means when at all costs and there's no space for you\nThis morning tactical do in order to win and and the and nothing works because of our division\nDoesn't democracy require something finer than that\nIt's an interesting point because when you when you look at politics\nTwenty eight seems style it really is about being absolutes\nAll of our party is going to vote this way all of your party's gonna vote that way and we see it playing out in the nation's judge approval process as we see it playing out in policy decisions all Republicans for the most part in favor of tax reform all Democrats saying not on our watch\nWhat does that data for one for seven nine nine months six twenty a little more from the piece by John tastes like Ohio governor\nWhen our leader starts the public will follow because you know Americans have it in them to achieve great things when they come together the examples are all around us the professional first responders an ordinary ordinary citizens who braved the reign of both to save others at the Las Vegas mass shooting\nOr the Cajun Navy\nA fisherman that weekend voters would save strangers traps and trees are on rooftops after Hurricane Harvey they weren't playing is zero sum game there were they were unique Lucy they're kind of selfless response and so many natural disasters and manmade tragedies of waste ordinary people who do extraordinary things when they put themselves second and then the mothers first\nStories like these give me hope and confidence that our nation can see through the peril of zero sum games and return to its chew heart starts from the leaders of our country of politics sports business religion other areas\nRemember there do you listen to one another and work for the greater hire good to be United America that is who we are and who needs to be to like the way for world continues to need America's leadership in so many ways to gather together we you and me can make it work because we've done it before that's from John tastes like governor ... Ohio also former\nCongressman from that state what do you say for one for seven nine I Want to six twenty I'll tell you this while it's great to when when you're on the winning side and uh even though I don't support lots of the comments that this current president makes Donald Trump\nIt's good that went on some of the policy things and I've I've supported him on many of those efforts\nTo support the tax reform package I think he got close on health care not quite getting it done of course the famous John McCain some don't vote\nBut he's a presidents who said he was going to do some things but he got an office and he did those things\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty is compromise is it a dirty word or is it something we should strive for when it comes to politics it's always great to when we are joined the losing side that doesn't feel so so good\nAnd I think what we're seeing play out in in the in stories like the Kavanaugh nomination\nDebate over immigration and healthcare\nSucking us any closer to solutions and that ultimately I think is a is a problem for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I'll take your calls or Tex Mex she's really on this Wednesday right here in the ...\nThe holidays are run around the corner WGN Jay faxes annual holiday radio show WGN Jay present the night before Christmas starting gene marriage a matinee or Jeff Wagner and a sleigh full of Wisconsin celebrities from\nTurner hall in downtown Milwaukee and Monday November twenty six at six thirty the lab radio play with the court is in front of a studio audience and you could be a part of it by tickets now go to W. TMZ dot com or touched the word Christmas before one four seven nine nine one six twenty can it be Eric were already talking about Christmas the WTO I'm Jane\nRadio show man what does the radio show just how it is with all that there have been snow flurries and I actually some accumulating snow in the state already surround her way I was talking before the break I read a little bit of a giant case a piece in USA Today about\nThis winner take all style of politics got a couple of callers on it let's go to let's see let's go to surely an el cornering WGM chicken morning surely\nLearning what do you think I agree one hundred percent ... our ... our governor gang kit cotton land ... oh about ... where I felt at work my way or the highway ... do not work\nThe big question is what should we do will will it change what can we do about it\nWell we need to Tom concerned about it ... or our fellow man we didn't get down to my phone and get out of Facebook and start oh\nI'm a big fan of that idea of the art of conversation there thanks for the call Shirley is is one that we need to get back to uh too much shouting at each other that doesn't really lead to um problem solving are solutions let's go to John in Milwaukee or there'll be ... morning John\nTheir morning what do you think\nI'm thinking Tom ... is absolutely right and we kept on politicians that goal so\nYou know democracy or are they often and I'm\nGoing to ... you know a A R o nine and my aunt and should the environment in one way\nHow how hard that forty five percent of the insects are gone and uh that we grow them by on on on on where in twenty moon up on her dress the damage that we can get um\nDo you own or listen to the majority of people on for\nA an by on oh I never served\nOn the phone all off to a continuous tension so I think John Kades tickets right you get ... on that that won't listen to the large body of people\nDo you think the current crop of a elected officials in Washington DC and I and I had like Washington DC because it is different than the national level but I think than it is at the state and local level local level\nI think I Would disagree you okay tell me why they\nHate and I'm like oh okay so we have that level are are not environment conscience at\nHow much how much states you put in the fact that there are different opinions on some of the stuff\nI I put I put my thinking that the Ninety eight percent of the scientists that studied the power of what's going on with my main thing is there\nThanks for the call John I got a lot of Texas as well so I Want to read a couple of them a mix from sturgeon bay just wear it with Governor cases like us to compromise with democratic legislators tax increases open borders socialize healthcare abolishing ice weakening the military national security justices that legislate from the bench just wherever they are great ideas\nThis is this was kind of what I'm Talking about now I I'm I'm the points that Mrs making a bomb\nAre they are great ideas this is this was kind of what I'm Talking about now I I I'm I'm the points that Mitch is making abolishing ice crazy open borders crazy health care for all seems like a great thing if you\nEver figure out how to pay for it and and I think most reasonable rational folks understand is probably one most expensive ventures this country would ever go down to do that\nBut there are incremental improvements and solutions to some of these problems that you could make for example immigration Dr\nSecuring the border take the illegal immigrants out of it drug trafficking human trafficking when I had attorney general brush him on the show he told me Ninety percent of the drugs are coming to Wisconsin cross that border that shouldn't be a\nRepublican or democratic issue it should be both\nThere's smart solutions we can find that does involve listening to each other and and I would I Would put it this way we've gotten to this point because we don't listen to each other no this is easy very complex problems that existed for decades\nElected officials of kick the can down the road for far too long at some points\nProgress candy may but I think as as a governor case accent is going to involve actually listening to what people say and then working on on solutions based on that input then I think that's a the the the power of his words somebody who has not been popular conservatives but actually uh has has um\nA message I think that's a result owning with at least some Republicans in some conservative\nAnd very happy everybody as you know all\nThroughout this month just that is doing his WGN Jake hairs raised to be an issue\nToday another installment joining us in Studio Mike Nichols president the ... Institute also the author of a book just a few sleeps away and Eric this is an incredible story an incredible project and this is another piece of that\nRight and what we wanted to bring Mike in because he knows all of the players if you will and can kind of describe a little bit more about how this family has read\nThrough the years and what has become now Mike first of all thanks for being here and thanks for having me or I don't know if you have read the book or not for those who have and just a few streets away it's it's not I don't want to call it a challenge and read but it's a difficult to read at times because it is very emotional and just it's wrong\nMoney so I mean the\nChevy offers we try to you can find the right Trump did your lifestyle [noise] maybe you want to see them midsize Chevy colorado or the ability of heavy Silverado unwritten\nShowing of Chevy Silverado we check check and check\nDo matter which may be\nWas Russia\n\nYeah probably the story of the game at least in the early portion the decision\nBy the brewers to play the match up games have weighed Miley pace just one batter and then bring brand new ... so simply Brandon would dress\nIs the starting pitcher even though he doesn't start the game that makes any sense and the brewers are trying to play some games in terms of getting match ups and it worked out by the way it was the best brewer today was probably brand and would ...\nI Know it gives up a couple of runs late but he was rolling through five innings might have been left in there are a little bit too long welcome back into brewers extremes you're on WGM jade as presented by associated bank my name's Matt Pauli let's bring in Fox Sports Wisconsin analyst Jerry Augustine\nAnd argue let's start with that what'd you think of the way this things started out with Wade Miley facing one batter and then Brennan Woodrow coming in after that\nWhy you know I I thought it was kind of unusual that they would they would start up my alley on three days rest I think what you want to do in a hurry just try as much as you can to get as much restaurant you can go on a natural natural routine so\nI thought something was up and I ... I thought it was a murder and the brewers because it's worked before and when you\nYou start out they they set their their line up you have a better match up so I thought quite there is a nice job of\nStarting starting with the my I just you have to first hearing that grant bringing order who is who left I could have come in a ball game didn't come into a ball game but uh the way he's been throwing the ball you got to kick that you've got to use it as best you can bring them in at that situation was the perfect time to do a\nGreat council spoke to the media just a little while ago for folks listening will play it later on the program but uh he was asked about it and he said look this is the Dodgers team that's really tough to get good match ups against so we're going to do whatever we can do to try to create some advantageous match ups and they that's what they did was Woodrow\nI Would argue Augie then it works to perfection because would dress through five of the best innings that we've seen from brewers pitcher in the postseason\nWell you know you look at the at this doctor came in as well as the bird came in we took a while to match ups and because we have so many guys on each team that are so versatile so when you can play the matchups situation you know you can benefit from that they're starting to seem like a\nBall club that led the national league hit home runs they hit ... power they have and hit a home I did this series yet a today and made some good things that really hit the ball back up the middle of it's a nice\nJob of putting the ball player but any time that you can pay match ups and have the match ups benefits you you got to give yourself that opportunity and I got pregnant a nice job of going with that match up and they are and what really three to four well can you can ask much more hurt a way to to ... to\nArgue bottom line is you got to score and more than two runs today you got to school more than one run yesterday and the Thirteen or ... or do they are not going to advance of the world series if those bats can't warm up a little bit\nWell you look at the game today you know you up for the fifth inning and it's one of the ball\nGame in a in a Dodger scoring the fifth if if there's any way like in the second and they could have scored a couple more rods and you know you've got to get you got to be able to have to run scored by the top of your your batting order and you look at what the brewers have done this series\nThey scored six when Ron ... votes run at scored by the seventh eighth and ninth get her so your capital I ended up had really has to come through and get on base and apply pressure and I think\nWhen you talk about this brewer line of what was successor for them the last month a season it was applying pressure up and down the line up and I think that's where where the uh the Dodgers have really done a very good job in the top of the line if you look at the top four or five guys haven't been able to apply the pressure yes\nCain Lorenzo can't have the big double that scored scored the first round but other than that you haven't seen a lot of guys being able to get on base and apply pressure that's been the big difference in the series\nDoes weighed Miley going and throwing those five pitches today and then having the off day tomorrow I mean how does this is who is very a light appearance they impact anything for him going into a game six start\nNo I hear very common that you have a you're cutting out of how you want to work out your you're going to do some throwing\nA anyway so going just one or two picture going by ten or Fifteen pictures maybe warming up lately like getting up and really doesn't affect you in fact I I like that 'cause you sometimes you get your you have that opportunity getting the game and get under that game situation you know or the playoff these guys are experiencing\nPlayoff baseball so any time you get a guy to ...\nGet a guy in the game the experience that is good but for weight in my area I I don't think it affects them at all it is really got a good approach you've got a good idea you understand why he has been successful this year and it's really gone out on that gun exactly what to present them to do so I don't think this is going to affect him at all\nWith baseball postseason you live and die on every game it's a very emotional experience especially when you're within an hour or so of the game ending so I I get the frustration from the brewers fans of the team is not lost two in a row and the one loss away from their season coming to an end but on the other side Augie\n... the bullpen is set up you got to starting pitchers that are available for game six and seven\nThat have done a really nice job this year and you're coming home to a place that you've been as good as anybody on your home field this year in the national league and gene that has already won a whole bunch of games in a row like I'm not saying it's going to be easy this is going to be a tough next couple of games and the brewers are a little bit behind the eight ball right now\nBecause they're potentially one loss away from the season ending but also they've got\nIt'll be a tough next couple of games and the brewers are a little bit behind the eight ball right now because they're potentially one loss away from the season ending but also they've got they've got a heck of a chance as well to win the next two games of Miller Park\nI I think because one word that always comes up Matt we've talked about it during the season is resiliency and and their resiliency today of course are the way he he stepped back you're after first her studying and really to the ball very well retiring turkey no role to\nPlay and his stance that pitching seven innings but it it's it's the ... through the very resilient gotta look at when they're coming home their bullpen is going to be well rested they're going to be ready to go when they come back but\nI still think the key to the whole game is pills for we're ready to go and get your usual game and and keep them in the ball game and then let the takeover\nBut still when you look at what has gone on over the last couple of games it's about the property order and up and down that or those guys getting on base applying pressure put it in the ball white movie runners over that's going to be the key for this group of yes the pitching has an outstanding you can ask\nAny more what this pitching staff has done in this series\nBut it's an office that really has to get a question that's going to be the key and I think this is talk of understand stands at their resilience the pouch back and I'm looking for them to come home are getting kind of our own crowd are great fans and and hopefully they can turn things can get a get a kick back in the right direction the way they were at the seat\nOf the way they were in ... and ... he has a place such good baseball getting runners on base by pressure it's going wrong\nOn August ... ballpark of product\nIs going to be exciting it's going to be a great time in Milwaukee we were still in the singer coming on\nUh we just we when the first one to find out what happened but the game on Friday nights going to be a great ...\nAbsolutely big dog you All right any time\nJerry August ... from Fox Sports Wisconsin joining us\nHere on brewers extra innings after the brutal response to the Dodgers\nBy five to score if you want to call or text in you can do so on the ac unit mortgage talking text line for one for

leaders from both us to argue touched on a couple of things I really I'm In a good show you a change of pace hearing and back you up to that I um [noise] I think what's happening is like you said it's getting very emotional um this is the\nSecond guess there's nightmare almost you got managers kinda micromanaging you can dispute whether they're doing it the right way or not I think they're doing fine um you can either and point out some situation where you and I both last night\nProbably I'm sure maybe ground should have been faced a pitcher and those are debatable issues what did they said at the best\nFences gotta get going mhm council than running as a result they're the best that he knows how to do he's got a lot of assets are they using them wonderful you just ask the Roberts if he thinks councils running as pitching staff well he'll say yeah these are tough guys hit again [noise]\nI um I was wondering if maybe we can\nNot so much no to write about maybe rearrange wind up here the the guy that was pretty good for them and you know early on and on and grants from who is doing pretty good that I could put him in somewhere just changes maybe that would work out\nYeah it's it's an interesting question and I'm not first there there's a few things to go into this first if if the game was being played tomorrow if there wasn't an update tomorrow if\nGame six was tomorrow Thursday I wouldn't start he's just Aguilar to me he he's one of those kind of guy that happened during the regular season\nNeeds a day off the air and he's a big dude any needs a day off here and there so to me we saw this happened during the course of the season where it seemed like he was wearing down and he just needed a day now the fact that there's an off date tomorrow\nThat maybe that changes that although I Would not be shocked to see a line up\nIn game six were maybe ... Shaw is playing at first base and they go with an ... or even a Johnson scope of probably more likely in her non press at second base that would not shocked me uh and I've if it was happening tomorrow I Would almost guarantee that what happened\nWe we're calls last night I couldn't believe that we're calls last night calling for Christian yellow to be taken out of the line up and to be benched\nI I'm not going to tell you a plane while he's clearly not I don't know if I'd say he's lost at the plate but he certainly is not completely sure of things at the plate I mean due to the one fifty right now but he got yeah\nHe's he's gonna be the national league MVP he's arguably the best player in the national league\nI keep putting out there every day because at some point he's going to break through you know he's going to find the summers I guess it's in basketball if you're a shooter and basketball how'd you get out of your ... your slump\nYou shoot the living heck out of the basketball Christian yeah which isn't going to get out of his slump are studying the bench and if it means the brewers lose the CS\nSo be it I'm going down with Christian Yeh which in my starting line up\nEvery single day that the guy who got you there so I view yell at you now you are a little bit different it's because they're different human beings are different body types\nThey they need different things Granderson has looked good I I don't know how you start 'em do I'm not taking Ryan Braun out the lineup that was a question from Brian chore would I Know Braun doesn't come up with a hit yeah today but yesterday he was three for six\nOr ... before today's game brown who's sitting in the high to eighties you down to about two forty right now but Brian Brian's when swinging it fine Lorenzo came finally got things going a little bit today\nSo as much as maybe you want to get a Curtis Granderson as much as you maybe want to get a Domingo Santana ended the starting lineup I continue to run can yell at you brought out there\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one six twenty that is the acting up mortgage talk and tax line speaking out Ryan Braun we'll

great pitching staff are thinking underrated both that obviously all their starters I think it's\nUm you know obvious that they're incredibly talented pitching staff um but we just picked up a bad time to go through a rush rush offensively I'm going through a period where there's a lot of guys who are and seeing the ball well I thank you combine all those factors are and we end up in the

show hello Daniel so how can I be of service to you\nYeah so I was approached a with a co worker who has a great education in my book and he was ... about eight to me he was starting to work part time for and so forth\nSo he set a scheduled time than him in a representative from this company came on over to sell kind of ... life insurance and uh because life insurance she'll funds and getting out of bed and stuff that sort of and of course at the end uh\nKinda pitched a little bit about how they were top fifty in a way that forms a year stock exchange that they are on and how I can work for them so folks with that\nBut hey I was not about necessarily buying the products although they'd like that but you selling for them as well\nCorrect Monday they catch the way it seemed like was you'd have to pay nine dollars\nFor a background check of what they stated a and from there are a twenty five dollar technology see if he chose to use the technology for it now just the company said that they are trying to help only middle class families\nAre in that David also send us your licensing are for the state to satellites life insurance mutual fund et cetera so my question was if it was a legitimate company if it was a legitimate potential side income\nOr just a regular\nMLM or a multi level marketing\nNo no this is a legitimate seller of mutual funds and insurance Lee's they were talking about those are completely normal there's nothing okay rip off or weird about them what you should know is that when people call me\nAnd the other side where they're saying hey I've had the salesperson offer me these mutual fund should I buy them\nAnd on that score I've said they're very very high cost funds\nSo if you were coming to me as a customer for the product I Will tell you why it's not a product I'm excited about it all OK but as far as selling it's not a scam is not a rip off\nUm it's just an expensive way for someone to start to build up investments for the future and to buy insurance so okay does that help at all\nThat's all it does what does that make you think you want to do\nUh I Do like my normal job right now I guess it's a it's not the best product that I don't want to and you're supposed to be helping families out I don't feel comfortable maybe selling that product it's not the best product out there for them\nGot it okay good for you and it is I'm Glad you have a specific reason that you're able to give them other than say will Clark said I shouldn't do it [laughter] I'm not a bad okay [laughter] I got enough of that going on there is with us on the car coward show hello Andrew\nAlthough Clark how're you great thank you you have your retirement plan with ...\nUh that's correct yes\nAre you a teacher a college professor or work for a nonprofit how'd you end up with them\nI was a teacher for fourteen years in public schools but I'm a college professor of seven years at this point so\nAnd so the the university here at offers Tio retirement plans\nThat's correct and they're very generous to the new tribute to eight percent a year to our retirement and uh in addition to that I've been contributing roughly seven percent to that same retirement\nAnd the question I had for you as if that is really the best thing to do because the eight percent is really not a match\nIt gets contributed whether I contribute or not\nAnd I also have a credit card debt or that my family is a build up over the past couple of years because of some health issues and medical bills as well as some damage that occurred to our house to water damage that we had to have repaired uh\nWell I'm Sorry yeah we've had a lot to deal with how much you\nWell yeah but I mean life necessities you know you take care of them out at any chairs so uh so we have five but now we're I'm\nI'm sort of at the point where I I Need to sort of figure out the best way to eliminate that credit card debt and I was wondering\nIf I were best be served to pull that seven percent that I put into my retirement to use it to help pay that credit card debt off and I guess the overarching question is what I'd be better to even be putting any money in her this ... or would I be better with Iraq wants to discredit ...\nI Know you know the the plan that you were in with the uh is so low cost\nBed and it comes automatically out of your check 'em really comfortable with you doing that and at some point she may offer some form of a raw for three be\nIncentive to traditional and you could consider at that time going into the Ross version but going from the seven percent you're putting in to zero and just picking up with the employer puts in with the university puts in there to concerns I have that I'll just lay out to you\nOne is that\nOnce you reduce it to zero it's hard to get back to putting that money aside for your future and all the time you have that you're not putting money and you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow for you\nThe second thing is that and I'm Sorry both of these are so negative what I'm saying I just got away I'm Out the other is a lot of times if somebody does let's say take it down to zero and then you have that seven percent that sale added to your check\nWould be a little less than seven 'cause it would be as free tax money going and now the net effect you maybe like five percent more bump into your take home\nIs does that five percent actually make it to the credit card bills are not a lot of times the money will somehow vanished before it goes to pay those bills\nSo you've got to know yourself shore or compromise would be what if you cut your contribution to let's say three percent from seven\nSo you're still contributing to your retirement and you use the difference to go towards the credit card debt\nOkay and that's a thought 'cause you'd still be saving roughly eleven cents at each dollar with the employer money put in in ... you're putting again\nAnd then you can put your focus on getting that credit card debt pay down and I wish you the best with the uh with the medical situations and with the house\nAnd you're able to get this debt wiped clean you know it's so important\nTo me that you have access to the information that we provide on the show at your fingertips and that's why we have a number of newsletters now that you can get on a variety of topics\nAnd if you go to court dot

reports and scores work based on your Social Security number\nOkay 'cause it's been so long since we've applied for a credit card I mean it was back in the paper days away really oh yeah oh wow yeah I mean we have\nI don't know there is a way to fly by paper anymore\n[noise] well that that was the problem we couldn't find we couldn't find out how to get an application so uh I mean we've had you know there's cars we had for well over Twenty years [noise]\nAnd now are very loyal customer you know whoever you end up getting a card from\nIt will be to their advantage to have you because there's a big expense for the banks getting a new credit card customer I've seen estimates as high as six hundred dollars a new cat should new card\nIssued and marketing costs when they allocate it out to one new person so you being loyal for so long\nThey end up doing very well with you versus people card hop\nSo if you want to make sure that you're doing it the safest way possible go to the actual website of whoever the card company is\nAnd do your application through that instead of in response to any female or anything like that kind of like when I talked about earlier with the scam with the tuition\nAnd and we've done that when we know we know the site where we want to go and so uh\nWe'll ... that that is okay to do you\nKnow my thing about giving your Social Security number out is only in a situation where it makes sense and that would be a case where it makes sense because they have no other way to evaluate you to decide whether or not your credit worthy and they want to issue a

time\n[laughter] [laughter] yes yes yes I'm I'm a single mom and my Thirteen year old now means I was given a code six thousand dollars\n[laughter] and um that's really a ... for me even though there is insurance and insurance will call me a little bit of it that covers only maybe a thousand dollars but the rest of the time I didn't have to pay for and I cannot avoid it\nI was wondering if it with any sort of program that um you know low income families could get racing down on a sliding scale said the dairy scale or even for free though I'm\nOkay so I'm not aware of any reduced straight programs based on income to get braces but I'm about to step into something that whenever I mentioned that I'm asking for trouble but I'm going to mention the way I'm about to tell you something that orthodontist hate\nAnd think that it is a danger that it's creating a menace for your Thirteen year old\nBut there are now a number of organizations that sell braces\nOver the Internet oh and they send you a mold\nThat you take an impression of your Thirteen year olds T the mold kids tend to be like eighty two hundred or so dollars and so you take the impression and then they based on the impression\nMake 'em make these um retain ers for you that ah that\nYour child would wear and that these things that people are buying on line ... costs tends to be depending on who you go with a thousand of two thousand dollars so I think that's a huge reduction and cost\nAnd I am obviously not um [noise] an orthodontist\nAnd all I can tell you is that the orthodontist think this is a horrifically awful terrible dangerous idea that people are doing it\nMore and more oh I see who can do I I'm\nJust want to introduce that what you make your own decision tell you that I Am I'm qualified to hell you if that's a good choice or not\nUm I have\nKnow both of my daughters went through braces they went the traditional way to an orthodontist it was the fortune you talked about to have\nA Thirteen year old son seems to be fortunate enough to have ... seats that are really really straight and hopefully we'll stay so now you may not need braces but this is the alternative\nThat again I have no personal experience with I didn't do it to make it but if you were to go on Google or whatever search engine you use and do a search like a self self unsolved brace\nSelf install races or something like that you'll find there are a bunch of these companies selling these now\nOh wow okay [laughter] [noise] well um that's interesting to know I never heard of that but I can do Google and just get the EMT though\nYeah um and make a decision if it's anything you want to get involved in a\nSearch a bat search terms that in order to braces at home see if that works and then you'll\nFind and file looking right now oh my goodness there are a lot of these companies oh well that are selling the self install again I Can't tell you if it's\nA good idea because I'm not a medical professional and you know we tell you it exists\nAnd they do go with it I Will let you all know so it\nReally is I Love the feedback you know one other idea that may work is a lot of dental

Saudi Government of property a consulate in Turkey of a dissident journalist and uh we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey and the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nHighest is thinking that there seemed to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime for at least a portion of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence they'll be getting the Saudi Government was in the way and bald\nLet me let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope he should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's hill in their ah mostly that we're helping them with so that's my Raymond\nWell All right a very good any ah any thoughts on the beach to the caller\nAnd trying to think about different things that like can be done also and one might be to significantly limit the number\nOf a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of\nStatement about this um yes I mean I see your point is there's this gym in our talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad and nobody tells us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nIn some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give it a pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts farm\nNot giving them a mass either I'm just not sure why it was a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't that the brutality of their act\nOr the apparent brutality again what we have so far or stories don't pass it off no one will know what I Would just be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that\nName when you look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one could be headed during entirely sure yeah\nI agree as soon as I heard that I Know that what that means as they tortured him a\nDare I thoroughly agree on it have you\nAs a as if this has never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not going to say what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt

in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much Dana Priest shaded and it's a real hot ... information has been for many years that failed to comprehend it somebody could write me I Would love to know why in the world we give billions of dollars\nEvery year to the Saudis Christiana poor report it she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life but she showed where the Saudis have fourteen carriages go five states in their account Barnes why are we sending their money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted that suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess a is a is a little hard to understand\nBut I don't understand it all I don't I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different\nBut they are someone who can be useful to his who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think Charlotte sport is extremely are well taken a one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\n[noise] hey Jim this call in to us in just a I'm trying to find out of the reason why the ... uh wouldn't just ... when the ... the guy on the consulate\nWouldn't just revoke his passport a which is certainly wouldn't put it in there or do you do show\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi law extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is there a story on a stick in the New York times\n[noise] again he would be just as out of the way the and uh I I think that uh again we have a a very\nRational thought process from Rick I get it and less and less we really think Sydney Powell the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of extreme brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think the ... just described would end up itself be or shall we say I'm a plus ... fate to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman that the evil sort of or shame and they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what\nOf their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric\nAgain a is a given a that they were stupid in dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me that they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well think that that was somehow pass oh okay you're only tried to made me a little bit ah maybe maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are the stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that and\nI'm certainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to ...\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the way they talk about this and if that hardly makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having freedom chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd now everybody says that um and I don't honestly think that the government would it then so stupid it's ... like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rather gallons of course we don't even really know what happened\nYou know we do but but I was thinking about this rogue elements in consulates consulates these are not just places like boutiques the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow by people can decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about ... granted maybe on something and it meant and and partly make Trump look bad and drop it make a wedge between ... you know as\nA ... that that is the level of Machiavellian you'll have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody uh on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on uh everybody on the left in the United states I mean the I don't see the game here for the risk of\nBut I'm saying that right before the election this isn't you know having the administration have headache\nWell it's got to be in the administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it this is not this is not

very well known limited as leader best selling author American professor of psychology and women's studies would say the University of New Yorker latest work is a politically incorrect feminist it was published by St Martin's press [noise]\nLooking at uh the circumstances of the Supreme Court today we reached the point where you can look at almost any given his you and if you are a veteran Supreme Court watcher you could pretty much called the outcome or within a vote because the court has become so completely illogical that there is\nA very great predictability about how it given justice will vote on an issue do you think that's a good or bad\nIt's bad [laughter] each one as we all should should be thinking quite independently and not\nA ideologically and it's part of a herd mentality of any kind that is a God given genius that we can be different and one of my sorrow says that the intellectual life with the academic life\nHas turned into the sound of one left hand clapping and no tolerance diversity intellectual diversity is a lot of desire to have ethnic and racial diversity but what about thinking to yourself\nWell why don't you that I don't think thinking for yourself is encouraged in fact I Would have to ask you as a person who is again but the term legendary is a is a\nA thrown about to do casually having these days but the the call you a legendary been the leader would be accurate and now you've written this a politically incorrect feminist my guess is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\nWell I think I Will but\nThis is a politically incorrect feminist my guess is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\n[noise] well I think I Will but I have written other books that I've taken hates them I wrote the new anti Semitism when I saw the ethnic hatred and the Jewish people rising and coming to us from the left and from the Islamic world not merely from white right wing neo Nazi world\nAnd I took heat and then I wrote a book called the death of the Senate is where I look at the failure of women's studies which became rapidly gender studies sexuality studies gay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues well forgotten\nAnd our feminists knowledge was not systematically passed on can next generations and that's why the at me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the wheel we in the early Nineteen seventies had speak ads on rape condemned it we worked on legislation we set up a rape crisis hotlines we changed how police handled it\nTo some great extent but all of this was not taught in the universities no was all broke\nOn domestic a woman battering or incest taught\nSexual harassment in Nineteen Seventy five Linda Farley coined the phrase and she published a book about it in Nineteen Seventy eight and then Kathleen Kennedy did so in Nineteen Seventy nine I Will bet you a lot of money that\nThe women's studies majors at the ivy league college just don't know about this\nThat would be tragic if true looking at the landscape puts out there today a in terms of the laws on the book and in terms of enforcement of those those laws where is the biggest problem in terms of this whole issue of sexual harassment and assault the laws or the enforcement\nOh God that's a good question what we've seen for the last year and today is the one year anniversary of exposing Harvey Weinstein is the exposure of\nBig name in Hollywood men entertainment meant and so on we haven't seen any exposure of men who work in a lettuce fields or who are the the shop performing in factories who are unknown to us and who are protected by their unions we haven't heard\nAbout what they've done and even if an allegation is that what happens is the woman\nIs not believed if she is believed she's fired\nShe's a whistle blower and she may have to wait five to ten years some sort of redress [noise] which is why women even though there's an ... me too movement that's global in so many languages I don't know how to dress for the women in Pakistan\nOr turkey or Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia expect what are they going to get\nGoing I mean in many parts of the world and let's just come out and say it in many parts of the world\nThe predominant viewpoint is all the we've just described it is not a crime or even a problem that's the way it is women are very or their property and they are to be treated that way I mean\nAnd there are people who will not only defend that we would but with righteous indignation now yes I don't I don't think there's any hope for people in those societies for the foreseeable future am I just a pessimist\nNo no I think you are real is but I think it's very important and very powerful that women that mean to barefoot women and women with education is both\nAre crying out to you have somebody like Malala Yousafzai you also got a Nobel Prize was shot in the head because she believed that girl should have an education\nWas reasonable mentioned\nPlaces where there is no hope and with the the ... he is barbaric there the women are also rising that's interesting\nArguing all encouraged by uh the the steps however tempted than had been taken in Saudi Arabia such as allowing women to drive by civilized standards they seem so so pathetic and yet and yet they are steps to do what extent are we consider that as meaningful progress\nIt's a step I work in Nineteen Ninety the Saudi women who organized the first and drive in and they were put under house arrest for a year and they lost their jobs now\nThere's a little something that's going on and and in a society like that it has to come from the top\nYou know so it's not grassroots from beneath its new leaders who says this is what we're going to have [noise] and that's well and good unless he's assassinated a because he has the power to do this that women are more an sales in Saudi Arabia should I heard of\nThat place [noise]\nUm there was a time in the Islamic world and I once lived in Kabul I was I wrote an American broaden cobble about my captivity they're essentially a long time ago\nAnd it was a time when women were unveiled with the kings dated or nationalist struggles accomplished it disseminate struggles accomplished it everyone was their face now go to Egypt and everyone is wearing the black

coming of a Miller Park starting tomorrow let's go to Jeff in when you're a zombie teams say good morning Geoff\nRight next to my mom so what would happen here\nAnd director of your mind on where you're writing covered you know I Wonder what are we what your somebody tried to get on with your fingers and somebody ought to try and\nIt'll be interesting to see thanks for the call just somebody retaliate so he got being in the game yesterday a but it wasn't it didn't seem to me like it was intentional\nUh and and then we could argue about that probably the rest of the show but it it it looked like it was just a pistol got away from the brewers pitcher and I and I think if you look at that I didn't shed any tears for many Machado I think he is a dirty player on the Christian yellow hasn't exactly rights\nWhat he's doing is diminishing his great talent which is significant he's clearly a top ten player in baseball\nIs defensive skills his offensive power and as I mentioned just as ability to get the ball back to first base on a on a ground ball apps incredible let's go to John in Brookfield you're on WGM digging morning John\nThe morning I have no doubt everybody in our will be on their feet when he comes out tomorrow\nI saw that when you are on the on the call screener and I and I encourage every brewers fan and and and thank you for pointing that out to be as loud as you can win many Machado comes to the plate or or whatever his name is mentioned as part of his game I think we need to send a message loudly and\nClearly actually I think that my wife though yeah go ahead I think that's going to be one of the messages that you'll hear at Miller Park over the weekend\nAnd you realize that took out the dollar is less than what you make every Indian\nYeah isn't that something you think about the scale of of the dollars that and here's a guy wait it's it clearly shows actually call Johnny clearly shows\nThat he thinks his talents trumps everything else and that he can do whatever he wants including trying to injure his opponents during a game and we've had a couple of instances of that in the series\nHe doesn't think there's any consequences action I I was I was appreciative of the other major league baseball or at least finding him I thought the sign could have been a heck of a lot more though let's go to Steven the pure Wisconsin good morning Steve\nThanks for taking my call her\nYou know I'd ever telling your screener I think it kind of a joke with again you would find I Would like to see major league baseball ... it happens again you think about it at your can brushed off the bat and not even in him and getting yeah yeah you know here's this guy is intentionally trying to hurt somebody [noise]\nBut unfortunately I don't think it really matters I mean people are very few teams today Milwaukee being an attraction that looks at the character of the players I mean people will be glad to get him he's a great baseball player and overlook all that other crap\nYeah thanks for the call Steven here's a deal by many Machado he's all about many Machado yeah he's playing for one of the best teams in baseball\nNot going to be playing for that team next year probably\nSo there's no loyalty there was no respect for your opponent I Know some folks don't think that's a big deal anymore but ... but when you drop sportsmanship respect for your opponent doing it the right way which it seems to be standards that have just been crumbling whether you're talking about sports politics or whatever\nI guess you get what you get with these people acting like lunatics on a baseball field isn't that much different than acting like a lunatic in real life with politics or anything else let's take one more before we go to break Rick from Lake Geneva you're on WGM Jay\nHey Steve I agree with the prior call a child gets shot out as loving baseball them played three strikes and you're out he had three strikes a incidences where walkie brewers players that theory\nOfficial uh uh the heads of major league baseball they should have noticed all this and said hey you're out you're out you're suspended for the rest of the season or something like that I\nI I don't think they would do that given the gravity of the series the weight of this is the fact that the Dodgers are trying to go back to the world series and thanks for the call red\nBut what I Do think it's going to happen if he does anything else in game six or hopefully game seven he's gonna get tossed out I Would be shocked if that didn't happen because you cannot try to injure your opponents\nWhether it's sliding into second base whether it's just trying to take the legs out from under he says hey you are at first base that can't happen All right we'll take more calls in Tex Mex many was shot or what should happen to this guy is he a dirty player more on that story right here in the ...\nCall it a great deal I think that when I was actually does directly

or never God's with\nThe crush her Reggie ...\nActually know some of his relatives very well great people well he's got to finally get his do and it's a guy who grow up watching wrestling on Saturday morning the crush her self Milwaukee was one of the icons of wrestling what was the thing he did he would have the beer keg on his shoulder and you'd be running through town\nHe was fun to watch fun to listen to the city of south Milwaukee then you can remember we we helped with us after we had Chris Smith one of the organizers on the show\nThey are going to now puts a replica of the crush are located up there near their cities train station they're old train station eleventh him off the avenues um honoring this great I kind of south Milwaukee's existence\nOr ... or a common name in that part of the ... of the area I Know a lot of them\nFor what I Love about this story is it recognizes a local person\nFor life well lift and\nWhether you're a wrestling fan or not this is somebody then

interesting\nNot ... to crush or was one of those people so the folks in South Milwaukee they raised the money they talked about fifty thousand dollars I talked to marry or looks at the uh turned her whole part of the other day she showed up um they raise the money\nYou showed up um they raise the money\nHe said all the people are asking where this thing's going where's this thing going now they know he said in a in a journal several stories are really really fun way to celebrate our most famous son and I agree with them\nI'd be hard pressed to find somebody from South Markey more famous than

or I think most of his fictional sixty\nNine other spectrum Cory Booker forty nine Kamala Harris fifty three so my question is really this\nIs there is a is there an age that's too old to be president is it's Seventy five is Seventy eight is it eighty Susan eighty five we've had senators go well into their eighties including some\nWho have gone into their nineties\nIs there is some cognitive drop off lack of a mental acuity that says yeah you probably shouldn't be part of the United states as that advanced age now where we're we're creeping up we're pushing up that number and as I said the president has no Seventy two\nBut Joe Biden will be Seventy seven five more years and that's at the start of the campaign season by the time he would take office he'd be Seventy eight\nThis is relevant because the other reason when they did a straw poll of the Democratic candidates for president twenty twenty he won by far is that you have thirty three percent of the votes amongst all those candidates for the Democratic nomination thirty three percent\nThe rest of them really made double digits\nNow I Know there's a lot of young people one that listen to the show that to\nWant nothing to do a job I\nThink he's old fashioned use out of touch and as as the voting population we used to what they tell us is getting younger and they're still yet to be proven and we'll see I guess to some extent in the mid term elections if that's true or not we told that we're\nTold that their energize ramped up enthusiastic about voting for new styles of candidates is Joe Biden a relic of the past not metro but\nKind of one on one conversation with them smart guy experienced guy\nWe disagree on most things he let me participate once in a ah a forum with him and that was the only Republican on

very down to earth\nBut does he too old to be president for one for seven nine nine wants to one of the eye can emerge talking text line where do you think too old or we get into a situation now where it's too many old people not enough young people running for office or is that experience\nThe wisdom that comes with age is that why we're seeing this trend seem to be ramping up in the other

Christian yeah which is clearly slumping right now\nIf Christian yellow which slumps and the regular season\nIt's a blip on the screen it's a it's a bad week and he's locked back in and you never even think about it or we talked about it during the time when I'm doing the brewers extreme post game show anchors the allergies and seeing the ball real well right now but that's kind of the extent of it he gets a day off\nHe he eventually locks back in and you're good to go well what's the postseason all of a sudden you get a bad week from Christian college and he's your best off into player\nIt can impact you we got a call on the post game show few days ago maybe was Matt in Brookfield something like that and quite honestly I didn't ... I was up against the end of the show and I wasn't able to have a longer discussion with him but he made a point and it was something that I had not spent a lot of time thinking about\nAnd ever since that phone call I've actually been thinking about it so for those of you who think that I'm not willing to listen to callers and think maybe they've got something I that's that's not true I I was an interesting point and I've spent a lot of time processing through it\nAnd I still don't know completely where I where I stand but it's fun conversation\nSo the brewers use analytic because they use numbers I mean analytics is one of these big old fun words to say they are huge numbers\nThey you they they see what guys do\nAnd numerically they're able to put a story line to it\nWhether it's what a guy does against ride these are left these where a guy is most likely to hit the ball on the field\nWhere your pitch a guy to be able to uh most effectively get them out like all that goes into its data collection that's really where we call analytics but when we're we're being very very raw and baseline about its data collection\nThe brewers are very very good at collecting data\nSo over the course of a hundred and sixty two games that's fantastic\nYou can have a roster that is not as talented as other rosters and you can go when the most amount of games in the national league because you've got all this data and your utilizing the correct way\nYou've got a guy who's slumps okay that's fine it's a hundred and sixty two games that five games or a guy is slumping not going to make a huge deal over a hundred sixty two games that works here's where the rub is when it comes to the postseason\nGuy goes into a weeklong slump your season can be over before he is\nAmong slump your season can be over before he's outta that slump\nMultiple guys go into a weeklong slump and that happens in the regular season often goes to sleep go look at the brewers you can you can find periods of the year times of the year where the office wasn't there it was frustrating at the moment but they got out of it\nIf that happened in the postseason\nThere's there's not enough time left you know it's a race it's a it's a hundred yard dash\nWhere you don't have enough time to make up\nThe the the deficit that you're in where if it's a four hundred yard dash or if it's a one mile long race you've got more time when I'm saying there is the numbers always come back to where they're supposed to be\nIf the brewers go play a hundred and sixty two playoff games which is obviously not going to happen but you'll see my point if the brewers play a hundred and sixty two playoff games well then the office of numbers the pitching numbers all that stuff is\nGoing to get to where it's going to be a Christian yellow slumping right now I don't think you take Christian you know out of line up I think it's ridiculous to take him out of the line up but I Do think it presents a question of\nHow do you juggle between the advance numbers knowing that eventually you're going to get to this point that the numbers say you're going to get to\nBalance that against the fact that in the you know the U.S it was a five game series and the you know the U.S it's a seven game series and a guy having a bad week or more specifically multiple guys see Christian ... are having a bad week\nCan really put you in a hole and so that was about I I have I've spent a lot of time thinking about because I'm I'm a big believer in the numbers and the way the brewers utilize numbers\nBut sometimes when you look at the trends in a short series do you adjust to those trends and it's a it's a really interesting question that's something that\nAh credit counseling David Stern talked about on an everyday basis brewers tonight we will continue down this line in just a moment stick with us here on WGM Jay\nAnd of course we do want to remind you the Packers fans assigned to cheer on the green and gold and celebrate with a cold Miller light at your local Packers bar swing by who's on third Milwaukee and Jack's American pub Milwaukee to enjoy a cold Miller Lite there is no better way to celebrate one hundred seasons of Packers football than was a Miller light\nWouldn't it be cool if you can buy something and then if it turns out later you didn't need it you get your money back\nOkay not all of your money but some of it a little bit at least that's exactly how it works with your west men home and highly policy\nWe send you some of your money back if you don't mind that claim all year plus everything is covered with one age one policy one bill\nAnd wanted a double germs out even your bank account can have a silver lining west bend the worst brings up our best to visit the silver lining dot com\nWaking contractors supply and say the crunch the cat rental store to names Wisconsin contractors trust for tools and equipment sales and rentals you recovered from ...

will go with the way my decision was asked to give something creative you\nGive me five minutes by the time we get to the segment I Will have somebody for you\nI stay tuned for that if that's not a tease I don't know what one it's so I asked and we'll have a good a click name for a what happened with the weight Miley yesterday I so we got that coming up if you met I it's\nIt was fun wasn't that fun I we we all get emotional and I get it like these games matter\nYour brewers fan you loved the brewers the world series is on the line no way shape or form it might dismissing the importance of these games and what's going on\nYou know I I heard an interview with a real you know you're not worried about what the you know with the witch and the first day he said you know it's like a and they'll be used to have ...\nYou know when somebody it so that you know ... or like I Want to go to console and still is pitching but\nYou know it's better not say that because it's for the Milwaukee Brewers who are there are but I like her shot like oh you got to you later you know you want your elbow hurts it\nSo I found more and more you do you prefer to be more like a you know and like what is the other funny all the players you know what I'm saying\nYeah absolutely I could be wrong in this I don't think major league baseball's good change the rule of some people say that these changes the rule on chefs I I actually think it would be more likely that they would do that but there could be a rule that says\nThe shortstop has to play the shortstop side of second second baseman as to play the second base side a second I don't think they're going to change the rules that uh starting pitcher has to\nFace X number of batters before you're allowed to go to the bullpen I just I think that takes away from the spirit of baseball and I know people are going to say well what the brewers did yesterday takes away from the spirit of baseball\nI don't think so you got twenty five man roster and against the postseason\nThis is not going to happen Craig council is not going to bait Dave Roberts into a line up with a bunch of writing Anders on may seventeenth or you just knocked it\nIt doesn't matter what happens in the postseason what you're going to change the rules in the postseason compared to the regular seasonal yeah and the post season starting pitchers have to go\nAt least three innings are so you're not going to change the rules there\nAnd we are seeing I mentioned Tampa Bay a little while ago and Tampa Bay did have a nice season they didn't get to the post season the most wins of any team in baseball not to get to the post season I Believe\nSo they were in the exact same situation that the brewers run last year last year the brewers had the most wins teen not to make it this year the rays were there the race had a really really nice season they used pictures a little bit differently they use bullpen pictures to start\nAnd sometimes they would go to a\nThey would throw a bullpen pitcher for one inning and then bring in maybe not a quote unquote starter but a guy who could go a little bit longer maybe you guys go three four five innings somewhere in there with the idea that\nGenerally the top of an order has some of the more talented hitters so if you can kind of steel that first inning with the bullpen pitcher and then you bring in a guy who's got a little bit of distance on them after that it's one less time going through the top of the order so you kind of steel and ...\nUnless time going through the top of the order so you kind of steel and any out of it that was one of the things the tampered did\nAh this past year everybody's looking at baseball and looking at the different things you can do to be effective and you could if you don't like what the brewers are doing if you want to see a starting pitcher that go seven innings eight innings all the time and that's what the staff has built out of you look at the Astros staffing you see a bunch of starting pitchers who do that if\nThat's the style of baseball that you like okay I Am and that's fine I I understand why you would like that more than what the brewers do that's a completely valid thing to say that you would like it more but when you cross the line saying what the brewers are doing is not effective that's\nWhere you're just wrong because clearly what the brewers are doing is effective they won more games than any other team in the national league and they're playing in the in CS raised in Illinois hey ray you're on WGM Jay and Matt how are you I'm good\nI'm I'm looking for the whole season I mean overall what count for all the way he's been managing the pitching staff I think is really an however my concern about what he did with Miley yesterday is\nI'm going to go home and wait Miley is traditionally a starting pitcher and these guys are creatures of routine and I I mean he only through five pitches but I'm just a little concerned how it's going to affect him tomorrow I'm going out there and ah when he's kind of outer routine\nI ... I I don't I ... you're right and what you say about him being out of routine because he was pitching in a game on a day that he was not really pitching so you're you're a hundred percent right in that let me a counter though by saying it was his side day so he would really be throwing aside session so it's not like you\nThrough pictures on a day where he normally would be throwing zero pitch\nOkay I I I did not realize that and um you know I think that um hey you know as far as people are criticizing helpful for what he's doing look\nIf they win\nIt all the other hand is doing it in the sports are copycats and so\nYou know I didn't realize that so I guess as long as a you know if it goes out and throws four or five six real good I'll I'll I'll be the first one to say I was wrong\nI appreciate and respect for the call\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty to academic mortgage talk in text line backers fans assigned to cheer on the green and gold and celebrate with a cold Miller light at your local Packers bar\nSwing by major goals be Milwaukee or cheers and can OSHA to enjoy a cold ... there is no better way to celebrate one hundred seasons of Packers football than what they called Miller Lite\nHealth see at\nThe brewers WPN Jay\nIt doesn't get more flexible than a line of credit meat ongoing working capital needs and tap into your line again and again tries to the national bank offers competitive rate sun lines of credit for a wide range of seasonal business needs including working capital trade discounts receivable financing and more\nContact your hometown commercial lender and learn more at T.
