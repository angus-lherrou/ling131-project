I don't know who owns it but there's several people living in it because of the four or five cars I see out front\nOkay well they're probably Louis water and her\nWay I can yeah I'm tacked or get a hold of somebody yeah Betty how old are you\n\n... how old are you Betty Ninety One or you've really yes God you don't sound it day over Ninety\nOh thank you okay\nNow is very yes and so you want to do this fairly quickly before you die understand that it's All right so bad that right yeah so good for you great sense of humor All right so many uh the trickiest finding out who owns the property and got that you can just pull title and it could be the bank owns that property\nIt with a rate to understand so therefore the bank ...\nWhich is exactly what you want the bank to own it because then you contact or the bank and say hey\nClean this up\nGet rid of a though that hanging though those hanging branches now when I Would do is you've got to do it anyway at some point and a is there a danger your property I mean is there a wall so being affected there's a\nFence fence between the two properties or understand I've been here for years and I understand it's a common fan\nAll right well I that doesn't matter even if it's common fence or they're responsible for any uh trees branches hanging over your property so here's what I Would do I get a bed\nAnd find out how much is going to cost ... if it were me I Do it myself I pay for it and then turn around and to those people but not necessarily have to be that way I could simply finding out who owns it and you can use a poll title on that that's easy uh that's just a ... Internet search because these are all public documents\nAnd then you contact the owner now\nYou hope it's the bank because if it's still\nIn the name of the previous owner\nI they're going to tell you to go pounds than they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worse that happens if you get a judgment against them let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line because we've lost our house but he didn't got credit is already\nThere and their distaste and their son took off\nThen you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you got paid for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door they don't have any responsibility or how bad is your problem with it\nWell it it to the point that I hadn't said anything to anybody 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it is a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are it's a lot how much do you think it's going to cost to clean that up\nWell I think it's quite large and the pine needles are about ... inches wrong\nOh yeah All right so you've got an issue I so I get a bag and I don't know how well how you do for money are you living tape for oh\nAll right 'cause then next question was going to be I like are you living in a gun\nOh good All right and then next question was going to be I like are you living in a dumpster and is it nice and clean and so that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who owns the property and just send the bill\nOh okay that's and then uh Trenton same small claims court as I said if the bank that don't clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're trying to\nSell the house and they don't want any liability and ah [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking small potatoes two hundred dollars is handle on the last\n\n...\nNothing negative and we were wondering if those hotels would do try and do anything to legally because we talk about um and we give their name that oh\nNo no matter of fact even if there were a negative and you give your name too though you give the hotel name out the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way that's defamation okay or you can do what he had\nNo no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year accusing the hotel and having bedbugs in your story any named hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but Hilton Marian Wright Wyndham let's just go through the names instantly what was the name of the hotel\nOr can they want to say that on the air bill\nWhy they don't know who you are\nA well actually truthful and I'm not sure if I can imagine\nA fair enough I it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way a ... and they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh I've just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege to recognize under the law so they couldn't go after what\nLaws that what you got your mind and it was the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it they're not the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel if it's true\nWith a you know what\nThere is no defense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say okay there are bedbugs are the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging remark if you're talking about something is positive they happen\nOr not only is there no disparage meant not only is there in the lawsuit for defamation 'cause it's not defamation or they're getting a commercial\nYeah that was kind of my take\nOut your way ... ... what what kind of book to write\nWell the first book with the travel experience a that was done and sort of a novelist stick\nLike in in real time you know strangely enough I probably didn't read it how to do\nWell we didn't do because we we put\nIt on hold okay as we were worried about language I understand there are no wonder you're okay you're very lawyer\nUnderstand don't you don't have to worry about that uh because uh the fact that it hasn't been published yet there is not going to be a whole lot of difference when you publish it I uh-huh terms of sales okay what's your next book that you're working on okay\nThen the second one uh this is a book about a um a period of time in my life I guess you could call it a memoir\nThat takes place in Mexico ahah [noise]\nYou know part of it involves they very well known cancer clinic and Mexico okay\nAnd there was an extremely negative scenario involved with this with this very famous cancer clinic or what I did and the second book is I changed the name of the hospital and all the doctors and and uh ... made it as I'm just\nCalling us then you're going to do anything to do that okay there's a little detail they're getting long part of\nMexico where it is it's the only cancer clinic and it's very well know\nAlright so big deal in the meantime here is ... I'm going to give you a reality check okay let's say there's defamation right ah and ah there's it didn't happen there's legitimate you're giving you a shooting fascinating facts that\nAre are not true so now you they have a case to things have to happen number one ah people have to give a rat's about what happened to you and they don't\nWrite so um I I wouldn't worry 'cause all three people going to read the book uh it really doesn't matter a number two they're going to be three people going to read the book uh they're never going to hear about it and if they do they're not suing you so don't worry about it enjoy yourself defame them\nI just have the time you're like couple of rules make sure it's a that you don't make up the facts and number two is as often as possible I make it your opinion\nOkay for example a it is my opinion that when they operate on me uh they took Indian\nI really don't know if they don't believe you can have a diaphragm though well there you are okay thanks for the call is handle on the law\n[noise]\n\nThe seventh Daniel fall\nFlooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin will look laminate flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nRefinished hardwood and bamboo starting in Ninety nine cents plus special financing south by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nIs nothing small and how your your passion your hours your reputation tongues huge partnership even\nWith ... technology indicted you'll get the ... and one on one partnership document in the ground with a reliable down the the rich and powerful and processors you can focus on what matters now getting down\nTo having having by down to speak with an invite [noise] having having I don't\nAre you putting your retirement savings and an four oh one K.

cell phones\nIt's come to that because with people getting excited about the new iPhones and the new Sam songs read all price out around a thousand dollars or so\nThe cost of people buying that a lot of people who were excited about the iPhones or say I'm Sorry they can't lay out a thousand bucks and they can't even handle two years of payments on a payment plan interest free which is still forty something dollars a month so now\nHere's this experiment offering three year payment plans okay this is a rotten terrible idea end up paying more for the phone each month likely been for your service each month\nAnd so it means to step back and look at in spite of all the hype and all the ads and all that look at a more affordable phone\nWhat can I use phone work at one of the mid priced phones are lower priced phones that you can afford to buy instead of having to finance a phone for three years that's like an albatross around your wallet [noise]\nWGM geniuses then when you want it with the

of that's just demographics playing into the equation but they're struggling to fill their enrollment and that means that you don't have to be\nThe number one student in your high school class or number five student in your high school class you may still be able to set off a competitive battle\nA bidding war if you will among schools they would like to have you as a student\nRemember my rule though you're never going to protect your wallet if you only negotiate a first year deal you need to negotiate a four year deal about what that\nSchool is going to offer you versus another school versus another school\nMay have heard me tell the story that my daughter uh after she made her decision where she wanted to go to school and rejected places one of the school she rejected came back and offered her a monster scholarship if she changed her mind\nAnd go to that place instead of the other one where she's actually attending and I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm gonna take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace to your advantage and with state school systems\nThis very somewhat state to state for more and more states are now going to three tier or for tier\nStates supportive school systems where they will have white is for lack of a better term maybe sometimes used in a state\nThe flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier forest here is a community colleges many of which now offer a four year degrees each tier has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier state school\nYour freshman and sophomore year will be far larger classes than someone who goes to a fourth tier community college and the state\nSo you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students for eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the flagship university in a state\nInstead going to a community college to deal with your pretty racks as a freshman or sophomore you might be in a class with twenty six people or forty four people not hundreds or thousands so he had a better deal and you get more attention from the instructor\nChuck is with us on the car coward show hello Chuck\nLarge\nHow's it going not ... not bad at all how can I be of service to you\nWell over the last six months maybe a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in buying my house you know they're pretty persistent and so I guess that let me\nLook them up and see what they're all about but a ... been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm a ... number two um if they are legit today you know do a\nA low ball offer on your property and water the dangers or to risk in in going forward with a lot of these folks yeah\nAnd I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can like uninformed decision\nRight so the the people\nWho are approaching use your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is\nSo go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that you're curious about [noise]\nUm one of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of\nCompanies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise] I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door\nDo is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea of being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOf national I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going to the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems where they can properly price house get it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide for what you get out of it is you're just done if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no ifs you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay and you also have to decide the\nPrice that you were offered [noise] do you think Bo balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nAll day does that make sense yes yes it\nDoes I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were totally\nTotally legit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I mean here's another one and there's another one called knock\nAnswer with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west\nAnd the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of uh uh subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses because they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\n... thank you Tom how can that be him service\nFor about a year and a half ago I got us will stay in the mail for credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause it never hurts to have a backup card case you need it\nSo I I when I got the cars started isn't that because it actually had a better catch that war than the one I was using crave this life so that one was on time\nOne afternoon I got an email from the car companies saying we've got your address change which obviously was a month so I called him a card looks at me and then when the whole smear\nAt that point I threw the cart into the to my file and started using my original are again and last September this last September I got

discussed with you a massive changes going on in how you buy a mattress in the U.S and how online sellers\nOr where all the growth is in traditional players are shrinking bankrupting out closing their doors because people are finding the shopping experience so much more pleasant\nBuying a mattress online where there's no pressure no confusion and you have typically three months to decide if you like the mattress or not if you don't like it no questions asked you get all your money back\nIs so much better than the old way of going into a store having a high pressure I'm\nSelf consciously laying down on a bed for a few seconds to say oh no that one doesn't work let's try this I don't know I liked that one maybe because then you get to stay home and you're like this the worst thing ever\nHappened to my mother in law and father in law that they bought a mattress in a mattress store and hated it so much but uh you know all sales final they were stuck with the thing\nAnd they'd been next round bought one of the mattresses in a box and got a great one well now the traditional\nMattress stores are pretty fired up and now trying to get tariffs put in\nOn foreign manufacturers of these mattresses in a box the good news is they're going to fail because amazing stats I saw in a market why story\nThe Chinese account for almost no market share\nIn the mattress in a box business\nSo\nTerrorists are not going to ride to the rescue about high pressure retailers trying to cram some mattress down your wallet that you don't really want because the Chinese\nI mean they're almost none of the market at all so you just have all your fun\nPutting tariffs on the Chinese mattress makers 'cause it's not gonna make any difference in his car courageous that you're trying to use political influence to keep yourselves operating and you just know as a consumer when you're looking for a mattress checkout these online sellers\nEmerging markets sets the terms for third world

from Facebook\nReduce ... this is the reduced number of people whose information has been compromised in different ways on Facebook is now down to thirty million\nBats progress because the last estimate was fifty million\nBecause that tells you how difficult the forensic research is following a data breach\nAs companies scramble and a data researchers security experts try to drill down into who's affected and how they're affected\nThe other part of this is not the good news the good news was the fifty to thirty the really bad news is what the crux God is much more\nThorough than estimated before it's considered to be the worst breach ever\nOf the Facebook social media platform and the crux have\nA lot of stuff like they might have your contact information like your phone numbers as they have for a many millions of people somewhere Fifteen\nTwenty million they have information on your email address potentially what computers phones whatever you're reaching Facebook from a your gender what religion you are at\nWhich people can figure out a number of different ways um they know what things have been searching on on Facebook last physical locations you've been out\nDetailed profile information they did not get\nYour password at least in this time there is no information that they have your password or credit card information but one area where I Do urge real\nOne area where I Do urge real caution with Facebook is that you do in fact change\nWith Facebook where you no longer use Facebook as a way to sign in two other accounts you know how often you sign up with somebody in one of the options do offer you is to use Facebook is your sign in putting too many eggs in one basket there and I don't want you doing that anymore\nAnd when you do get involved with social media\nKnow that the information they're creates vulnerabilities to go much deeper than you might imagine including\nPotentially rating your money if you have it and whatever brokerage accounts investment accounts or bank accounts you have [noise]\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country and areas subject to tornadoes or build with hurricane collapse which helps support and reinforce the structure of a home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nAnd the case in Florida we we live part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plots\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is it supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall he's for in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland that is an area subject to flooding and a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood flown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it shifts rethinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend to after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare\nFor the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount Soto incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat were a property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happens you have to rebuild again on and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf is with us on the Clark Howard show ... Ralph\nHello cart thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely how you doing\nI'm doing great we uh recently moved back for a living overseas for many years and he appreciated oldest say that you have to say to make out to the integration little cheesy area because so many things have changed and very ugly poodle your life's you've given us so thanks for that\nWill give it a little back story where have you been living in for how long\nAre first released the u._k. for about five years spent in Switzerland for seven and put in Hong Kong for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now no kids so [laughter] how about you have any language is do you speak at this point\n[laughter] well fluently and to a little bit so\nFantastic [laughter] and uh I speak English and enough Spanish to be able to find the bathroom [noise]\nLet's see that's all you need you just need to be able to or the food and drink in line and then you got to go\n[laughter] um one thing I'm\nCurious about after all those years away did you have a hard time re establishing a credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that worry those areas difficult for you when you re integrated now in the U.

[noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people who are gone for a number of years but how can I be of service to you today\nFor the last thing that we wanted to do is we purchased the crow look and to do our banking and financial as you have ... and I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account or the way that I can use social Jews and access to all took up and going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer\nUsing chrome book for financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account with not integrate because you know with Gmail\nWith the Google accounts when you sign into a

how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial\n[noise] uh I don't know I live bullets fully from ... to them no\nReal happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\n[laughter] I'm

available at a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nBuilt pay banking brokerage those kinda things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so grown books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um\nInsurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers and having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out at your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the

Republicans for jobs\nI knew rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to ... Republican voters by laying out at closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new might bring caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S\nI Will say I have caused the problem I'm thinking like such an incredible autonomy I Am so [noise]\n[noise]\nWhat's worse is in the world we're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws are blamed Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration and fly\nYou know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border [noise]\nIllegal immigration on a broad Democrats because here's joy knowledge or to change the laws like\nTrump also taking each winter with his dinner friday conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party led a stop in our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThe leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again same without evidence this group of migrants are criminals\nAnd Democrats for their part accusing the president of the er mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge that was cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create or something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance Trump is in full campaign though as the election season entered its final week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals he said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking to eye with a key lay low ratio of the rail wealth management\nAnd looking at it as something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig this is right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states\nNation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets to their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing in ... I Am not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without that country's permission or do you uh take exception to any of that\n[noise] you know I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that\nWe should have a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it shouldn't be definitely more career and um\nThat we shouldn't be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries are a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems\nThese countries that were created by us I mean unless Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know it's kind of a double edged\nThing although it wasn't the U.S government policy the created MS Thirteen\nCourse of course not only from LA\nUh they they they certainly are and of course many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up ah entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back at it and it's still stuck in my mind the\nSize of the red immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a writer you may argue that you think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be confirmed by a nation state uh depending on what is the best interest of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh I think things are changing you know just a bike ... Hispanics or or you know I actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like ... turned left you know it's more ...\nOr a by choice or we are a warning for one in four\n... persons here in the United states are going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that or not if we don't care policies that address this coming weekend because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more uh sons and daughters\nUh than an average angle a family um but more importantly we need\nTailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel\nBut more importantly we use to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel\nAnd that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr ended at a busy we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here in just a few minutes ah for example let's take the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who are let's say a robbing a bank or\nThat we would probably wind up the separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response frankly to those people is perhaps somewhat say harsh but uh this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a very lengthy and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but a\nSoviet uh that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\nYou know uh for many years\nUh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but\nYou know ... from the other side of the glass you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a whole show on that and and a lot of ... is not exaggerating but that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long but he proceeded\nYou know so you know ... in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the aisles to start having the dialogue started having this conversation\nNo one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy but we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino of bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and so anyway the uh the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this and the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue for the Latino population but obviously it is an issue with that issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime of all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the pattern of opinion here will be back in just a moment\nWith you a hundred percent on that uh were they are certainly not blameless there is a huge amount of corruption but I'll give you an example uh you know let's just take one instance where are you know let's just say you have a young child\nOr a teenager Thirteen fourteen years old every day when they're walking to school the games are coming\nOne gang or now they're saying either you're going to during our gang or we're going to kill you and we're going to kill your family now this is an extreme case but it is absolutely occurring across Central America and the rule of law has broken\nDown in many of these countries and unfortunately has created a situation that not tenable for a lot of hard work he individuals on\nAn hour and I'm not to blame how are we to blame wait another is how we create that\nWell a lot of criminals that were deported\nDuring the Reagan Administration\nA link down to the to their home countries right and the creators syndicate in each corner of these countries MS Thirteen being one of them but that's just one of many that are there and the right or wrong it was one of the factors that are that still creating this\nFeeling of hopelessness of helplessness in their eyes you know knock and you know I Can't speak for their opinion or whatever your but it's just something that has come up\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bowl as we take a call from bend the heat is on Long Island New York and joins the go ahead and Joe good evening bed\nYeah good evening I just wanted to know what you would consider the difference between four thousand Italian immigrants showing up at Alice island\nIn Nineteen eighty two hundred years ago or four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now twenty eight to what will be the difference a stash especially illegally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that they're the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a show or they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned of Mr ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short\nA months at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time by or they did not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire ...\n[noise] that's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say what's your population reaches a certain critical mass or does the obligation of a nation state to determine who gets it when you reached the point where there are a\nA certain number of beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat uh it has the obligation of the country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's the best interests of that country now grad and you go back a century and a quarter\nMaybe say a century and a half and a and we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive needed a lot of bodies and we were trying to settle the lands of a of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know [noise] um I I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and to generalize or stereo type\nPopulation coming in as not being educated not what you said but you know not only that education I I did not having the wherewithal you know when many of

people's business it's it's it's a way it's almost that emission by Russia that they\nCan't do better so they're going to\nOther people's business it's it's\nIt's a way it's almost as the mission by Russia that they can do better so they're going to see if they can make everybody else do worse and it's a very difficult\nOpponent to deal with because they're not really looking to win anything they're just looking to make you lose\nAnd of course with all of this is a the relative instability that's built into the system as I say it's almost as if\nA ... a mob family ran an entire country and have access to nuclear weapons and that's the the level of of legitimacy that exists in this country keep in mind what would happen to this country let's say a president to President Trump for President Obama had decided that\nThe state governors were just messing around entirely too much in the affairs of the country so this point are no more lectures I'm going to appoint all the state governors will of course the impeachment of conviction process would take days or as the president was ushered out of our life that's exactly what to boot and did\nHe got tired of all my family elected governors and so he appoints them all bad just because he decided to\nYeah exactly and so have concentrated justice incredible power with one man and you know the checks and balances that we have that need I added states\nIt's very difficult for a president or whatever we didn't declare war on Canada but you know if if ... were running the place the analogy would work I mean he could just\nDo it I mean there's nobody\nTo say no or to put the brakes on and you know a few of a little dictatorship and you know a small country in Africa or something like that you know it's terrible

to invade NATO countries on his border which he does have the ability to do and can't do it at a stop to the other the finger I mean nobody's going to push back against him in Russia\nYou know and it's something else about the the real Russian President Vladimir ... is an incredible no style job really evil empire I mean he has said is is a quote for attribution from ... ...\n... being the most tragic thing that happened in the ... century and I think about that the most tragedy that happened in the ... century which was Laden with super tragic items was the fall of the Soviet Union\nMost civilized people would put the fall of the Soviet Union at least some of the top three of the best things that happened in the twentieth century he has an incredible most algebra that era so to the extent that Doug ... is a back seat group of your character in the book read war that's a a disquieting thought is that\nIt is and I mean if you look at it as a lot of air tuned in to some extent the Russian people that have allowed him to can have staying power they are kind of obsessed with the power of Russia it's it's I don't know that there is anything they want to do with it in particular it's just that they want\nTo sort of desperately craved respect and to some extent the fear\nOf other countries around them\nAnd they had that uh you know when the Soviet Union there were a major\nPlayer in the world that people sort of what may move to the world trampled\nThey loved that and now they're sort of a just a second rate or country I mean so the country it away\nAs always

I mean it wasn't good for the people by any stretch of the imagination but the country was powerful and so I think\nPutting an end to a large extent the Russian people have a strong style job for that time when they were sort of equal in many ways to the United states\nAre really looking at the Russian history of free self governance I guess there was about an Eighteen month period between those are the communists of the\nMinimize the risk of conflict is to be actively prepared for your your thoughts\nRight you know I mean it is absolutely critical to ... look strong I mean that's how you maintain a dictatorship and control of Russia that people want the strong dictator it's why take likes to take pictures of himself shirtless on a horse or you\nKnow catching him probably large fish so this is the the Russian they're right here this is why she projects and every time he slaps the United states you know seen gains face we don't really reactor we react to some sort of economic sanctions which we should do but it's\nNot really a ... you know it doesn't play that well the ... the Russian people he looks like he's winning and that once again they have power to a face down in the United states but if\nHe made it created a penalty said you know we know you walked around that are in our investigated or in a lecture or we know you assassinated this guy with a nerve agent\nI'm rolling twenty thousand guys into the Baltics well now he looks weak she has to react to that he has do delivery to react to that so I I mean you've created a penalty for him but if we just keep letting him push at us\nAh liked it I think it's a really bad strategy I don't know why he's ever going to stop\nFor to come back in the moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home\nHere dancing on the cars would be covered and talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre all of them\nDuring my ... my ...\nI used to play the tabloid only the ... tons of resumes to find a female candidate for myself the my hair salon that old process was not smart and I went to a different it's thick nowadays games resumes for me to find the right people and actively invite them to find qualified candidates that\nSmart guys ever grew three to number one by employees in the U.S trying now for free at different ... dot com slash free that the recruiter dot com slash free ... smartest way to higher because of the rating hiring side to the radio\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days\nThen if rates go up your rates days locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at a hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial approval and without on certain three year fixed rate loan scholar concentration in conditions people having liquor license and all the big family member thirty thirty visualization virtually just may imply\nThis is John Green and if your teeth or steamed\nCoffee tea or smoking power swabs as the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strips or trade that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just ... for\nFive minutes and you're done to try and parents Trump's call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night you're white white smile will have your friends talking about how you look try at risk free\nOne eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine that's\nOne eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home\nHere dancing on the cars would leave governance talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or do we\nAre above\n... aren't the same time they're going to be saying well\nI'm from Denver eleven two thousand one world changed forever and we lost two thousand nine hundred and Seventy seven people in that day Andrea ... one village\nThe herders to describe is missing\nSome now her parents are hoping to honor Andrea's wife all of those killed in the attacks and those serving overseas I Would encourage people to sit down and spend a few moments thinking about all the lives that were laws was raised\nA beam in key why some more information had to ... pm Jake cares breeze any by first bank financial center\nWPN geniuses then when you want it with the Amazon Echo simply launch the Olympics and then in the ... million Jews slash briefing surgeon select WGN Jay ... to open WGM Jay\nSay listen live it was ... whether they kept good choice\nMore information head to W.

Joe\nAgain a doing fine thank you all um\nI'm not as ... but uh uh I tell you that a from a divorce or five years old or I was supposed to\nBe removed from my uh my\nMortgage that I had a way and now I haven't been on so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first ah and then uh\nAlways had a dream car around it for about seven years and then I have a solid uh which was the ... generally so it's going to cost me about eighty thousand to get\nThere I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nA I Am only guessing gym because short and now for five years or I guess in that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nBecause short now wait for five years you're\nI guess in that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure if you're you just to committed there between the mortgage and a and get your version of the general leave the old dodge thought she'd aren't here you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars or if it was the rest of that I\nI I I um I got three kids and unfortunately ah through the horse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and I'm\nAlso I'm a big animal lover so uh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a\nNo kill shelter and instead of having volunteers run it to have it be something to where they are paid employees a man that's about all I can\nThink well very good okay neither the of course two million each of the three kids at six million you're down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get an extravagant on the center you're talking about a duel knock it down or even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see what I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this money [laughter]\nOh no no no uh I Know the movie you're talking about\nI really enjoyed it and uh it's true you you just don't know how to go about spending that kind of money and if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I Would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound or bonds and the like I I Would I Would be sort of get my family forever and all I Would allow others to really really blow a ton of bugs\nHonestly there aren't that many things that I really want to do I mean you know the travel the world\nI suppose if you could afford it I mean you know ... some some big vacations and then see a few places but I mean there's a lot of passion of mine a mansion ah [noise]\nIt's not a passion of mine cars I mean you know most of the cars I wouldn't want to buy would get me a a a speeding ticket that would cost me a driver's license and in rapid order I mean\nIt would be tough for me to think of things to blow this money I'm not a gambler I'm not a big drinker anymore and uh\nIt would be tough for me to think of what to do with it it's All right thanks very much Joe Lewis Carroll in Rochester, Minnesota next on the jumbo had a

explain ... house some companies are deploying this robot technology\nThere's there's there's a range of ways that it's being done on you know on on the warehouse side there's a heck of a robot called the collaborative little by a which some people call ... and these are the smaller robot that can kind of share space\nWith ... workers or maybe at that mobile robot it's kind of where they end up and

square\nRoom by that helps you with the visuals um but it's kind of enabled with artificial intelligence and what it does is it thinks that with their water management system and\nIt kinda gets around the warehouse and it she under wraps it products and then it pops up and move the entire rack of product over to a worker who that is station where they can do multiple orders at one time even as many as forty eight\nUm and then it kind of you know that when when the workers hold on the part that they need to the robot will so with that lack away put it somewhere else and it's it's smart enough to even go in charge and so when it does it's running out of gas\nFor that sort of an interesting one um you know they can work out in the warehouse it's a supplement human labor\nBoy and and some of

I heard that a great turnout a hundred and eighty I was supposed to be there I ended up having something come up hundred and eighty five people showed up for this um\nPrice says it just blows my mind that can't listen to a corporate attorney who helps outsourced jobs from Wisconsin other countries talking about good paying jobs here he says so hostile shot should back I can think of at least nine times where a lot of great would have gotten really handy of course referring to the to the troubled past of one Randy Bryce\nYeah so it was really interesting and then Randy Bryce comes back with the\nUh that he has he hasn't been convicted nine times well\nNo he pled guilty most of those times a year and a couple of charges dismissed them as long rest history a but was what was really interesting then said he tried to defend themselves by comparing himself to John Lewis the civil rights leader congressman\nJohn Lewis since been arrested for the ... approximately forty times according to this but the official biography\nThose arrests were fighting for civil rights they weren't for drunk driving or not showing up in court driving with a suspended license a failing to appear in court after being arrested for driving with a suspended license I mean we can run down the list\nRandy braces arrest record compared to John Lewis was arrest record brand new prices no John Lewis\nI I think it's just silly that that the comparison that he makes about himself he might be the greatest guy in the world but when you're talking about running for U.S Congress and see I think that's pretty important it's my district the first thing restaurant district I have a lot of respect for Speaker Paul Ryan\nI don't want to see Randy Bryce as his predecessor\nI don't want to see it and I think it's it's a shocking that uh this guy's a serious candidate but you know voters will do what voters will do you made a a great point when you and I were chatting before the show about them baseball's a fact we're talking about the brewers Dodgers game Saturday Night and friday night on the right track wrong track numbers in Wisconsin thinking that a bit so I\nI actually asked Dr Charles Franklin who runs the market law school pole and he was a little bit optimistic\nThat it wouldn't have that much of an effect because of the tremendous season at the bird's head however ... you know looking back at history you did point out that that a shark attacks and floods have had negative effects on income and politicians\nAnd when we when we look back at the bird has three Nineteen eighty two there was a Republican governor he was replaced by a Democrat there was a bad time in the state\nUh at the same time when we look back at two thousand eight and every time that the that the brewers were in the playoffs\nIn fell short again that the Republicans took it in on the chin and the state legislature level or it can affect people's moods I'm hoping that it doesn't affect it too much what I Hope that we're all optimistic for spring I Know I Am I'm an optimistic brewer fan but\nIt could there is one of those little factors that you've just been a very close race that you just kind of wonder about\nTony Evers has made a shift in a TV as an artist known as the budget over the weekend very personal talking directly to the camera do you think that as a as a result of what Governor Walker's daughters ... just a shift in strategy what do you think it is\nWell I think there's probably a little bit of a factor that Tony ... realizes that most people don't even know who your real is\nAnd he's been the things by the Walker campaign as somebody who's for taxes and things like that so by putting himself up on the screen and talking directly to the people that it's it puts a face to the name and it tries to mitigate that kind of effect\nJames we just enjoying the as he does every Monday morning right here in WGM just take a quick break and then after the break we

James were just as we are every Monday or why did you talk briefly about the immigration caravan immigrant caravan migrant caravan heading through Central America\nWhat does this mean for elections even in the state of Wisconsin or the U.S Senate race what does this mean this issue the president has been pretty vocal about this in the last couple of weeks\n[noise] right well the main effect is going to have is on the border states in Arizona for example it's going to have a tremendous impact\nBut it will have an impact here too in Wisconsin or the president is coming on Wednesday is going to be campaigning in northern Wisconsin is going to be campaigning for senator ... Mir and this is going to be an issue that he is going to bring up any of these already at other stops it said the selection is about immigration crime and taxes\nAnd he's going to play this up because this looks like you know the screaming hard coming towards the border\nThat you that they've always warned about right so this will be something that they that they're going to play up and they're going to try to use to do a ... up the base to come out and vote for Republican does it play in Wisconsin though\nI think it does in with the Trump supporters in northern Wisconsin that's where he was strongest well during the Republican primary and during the general election so it will have an effect that way\nUh people are very sympathetic towards the illegal immigrants that are already here but there's a big difference between being sympathetic towards the ones that are here in the ones that are marching through Mexico right now waving the flag\nIt's two different images completely and people are going to look at it and say we need to do something more to secure the border\nAnd this is less about changing minds I think more than just increasing turn out right you need a lot of Republicans show up for the governor for that for the book where I think that's really what this this uh parents is about\nRight it changes all your turnout models that's what you're looking at a you want to see how many more Republicans that you can get that turned out the reason why ... mid term elections are usually bad for the incumbent party is because\nAnd by doing that he he trained elated the latitude and longitude of the enemy that they look for this weapon for many months actually 'cause it kept getting our troops go just go through anything\nAnd um when we were we were at one of his

did nine eleven shape your son's life\nI think it's just had a you know the ... you know the country just the way you know do everybody together and I can't say that necessarily after that he said you know this is what I Want to do I think it was you know a lot of components in it you know\nEspecially Boy Scouts that had a huge you know you were surprised though when he wanted to go to or no no I was asked if I Know I was surprised at all known\nAs the guy he liked David like to be very well prepared they he had his belt that he carried on him in the army was called the Batman belt\nBecause he had everything they need and it's like\nOut of love scout is you're always\nThat's correct I can remember when he was younger putting that his you know getting ready for Boy Scouts and he would come up with a uniform on and he just you know it just puffed him you know you could just see that pride in uniform so that didn't surprise me that transferred to being attacked\nAnd as your you told me that the community he loved working with the local Afghanis to like you see that some of the resident yeah that was something for him\nYeah it was his job to go round of the different a little villages near where his Ford operating base was and he would meet with the Afghan leaders and have to be with them\nAnd um it was very very dangerous um and what he would talk about with them would be um you know the Afghans will tell them will soon as you leave that there is you know these these people um um if you know like they was trying to help build schools and roads and things like that but then\nWhen soon as the the army would leave then they would the Taliban would tell the leaders that we're going to kill your family is if you do stuff with the American army so as David job to help

bring Democrats I Would not be a gets right for president\nAll right so if you're one of his front people and you're doing your work and getting ready for that\nFormer President Obama more than welcome on my show how 'bout that\nDoes that show that I'm willing to have that conversation in the civil manner I think it does Eric but this week is a who's who of people coming in Wisconsin to tell us how votes\nAnd I want voters in Wisconsin understand this you're responsible for your votes and I'm not talking to the people that always vote for ... for Democrats and always will ours for Republicans God Bless your your your party loyal knock yourself up I was talking to that group of people in Wisconsin is a big chunk\nWho way that candidates way their decisions\nSome of them why in bed at night they tell me this and emails WGM dot com fighting over who to vote for this election I Try to give him the the honest information who's better at this was better that who's speaking clearly who stuttering through her debates who's knots\nVoters have an opportunity here to weigh the candidates don't be swayed by a Bernie Sanders he's a socialist it\nSounds great to those people who want more government in their lives and our people like that I've\nSpoken to a whole room full of them I'm not one of those people\nIf you want more government Bernie Sanders your guy but if you want someone that's going to think about\nOf governments or local actually local\nState and federal all work together has to balance find a healthy balance between budget and policy\nBernie Sanders is not your guy neither is Kamala Harris who came into Wisconsin to celebrate her birthday apparently were the place where people come to celebrate their birthdays now and she was here from California very liberal senator high fiving with the junior senator from Wisconsin Tammy Baldwin\nI made this point earlier while all of us were sweating over the brewers game seven she's at a concert [laughter] is that's not the clear example\nOf all on connected to reality Tammy Baldwin is in the state of Wisconsin doesn't mean you can't love that ban doesn't mean you can't love music but you use that as a campaign stop I think they stopped the concert and let her speak to the crowd\n\nAnd it's interesting because she's not a great orator by any sense of the word\nMatter of fact when she's has to think on her feet she's actually not very good at it so did she ever prepared speech for the crowd avant of our I I Wonder if I'm saying there was a bunch of air about of air that it ... ... did she ever prepared speech that she read from or did you just go off out of a golfer guts\nThat's the that's the person I Know they're calling us great out policy is he the greatest speaker in the world I don't know we all have our moments including me or you miss speak use the wrong word used the wrong word in the in the wrong context\nBut it's going to make charges like that you don't wait three years and then throw it in the middle of a campaign it suggest that you're only about politics\nYou're only about trying to destroy someone's reputation with no evidence I'm I'm guessing the Senate minority leader Jennifer showing has no evidence\nWas it the right decision to go drink for lunch probably nuts but there were Democrats and Republicans in that ruined you call it and the Democrats for doing the same thing\nI wanted to point this up because it's an example of what the current state of affairs and Wisconsin as this nastiness\n\nThat parties used to try to blow up people not based on facts for example because I'm gonna get an impact on email and the next thirty seconds and when you go to Randy Bryce the facts are ready Bryce was wrecked arrested nine times\nWas Dale ... representative for the state of Wisconsin which he arrested for being drunk in the Capitol building no there's no\nProof of that but I Want to be fair and I wanted to play the words that he used you can make your own decision on that\nBut if we're going to throw around charges like that we should be fair in how we do this so shame on Senate minority leader Jennifer showing for doing this in a manner that she did it to try to win an election for someone on her Saturday I\nFrom what I Know of state representative ... pretty smart guy and there's a Republican I ... I Know he understands the issues and his great on policy\n\nThis stuff has to stop it's embarrassing to the state of Wisconsin It's not the same thing as Randy Bryce\n\nAgain voters need to be smarter need to be better listeners we need to process\nThe information that's out there a little more efficiently than we are doing right now for one for seven nine nine one six twenty Jack in the markets talking texture you want to weigh in on this more than happy to talk about it I'm On representative quaint aside you're going to say stuff like that then prove it if not\nIt's empty politics at its worst more next right here in New Hampshire [noise]\nNo one likes being stuck in\nSay go get you off a smooth ride right now John again whether object to the other on the news radio WGM Jay\nAt breakfast the cat I mean we prepare your children for college on life from K. three graduation day fled asked the neighborhood school\nIn your graduation day flat as the eye neighborhood school ... ... some people like ... ...

something that has become a political talking point\nAnd it demonstrates loudly include the frustration a lot of us have when it comes to talking about immigration\nThe border with Mexico and why Republicans and Democrats have messed Tibet on this issue for so long no clear immigration policy at least one that addresses this issue now you can think that\nIt's great that people want to come

[noise]\nOn Facebook which gives away in the in the mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty getting back\nTo the universe versus Walker race I'm trying to highlight some of the differences and the candidates on the issues that one was roads and to be honest there are some challenges here that Tony risk and make good does hit the mark when it comes to the Walker and restoration on roadways I've been to I've been a critic\nWe cannot keep borrowing\nTo pay for the road construction in our state and it's it's a failed policy it's an easy one for politicians to me because it it just kick the can down the road so the governor does have some liability there\nBut for Tony Evers he's giving us the old well have a plan after I'm inaugurated no that's not good enough if you want someone's votes tell us what's your plan is because what happens far too\nFrequently is of course Kennedy's get in office and they have NO PLAN or it's not vetted properly and we have no clue\nWhen I was going to have any impact on the problem with trying to solve so Joe rose I Will call that one even because the governor has some liabilities there and when it comes to paying for the future are roadways and the state of Wisconsin so that that's an interesting one as well\nEducation and taxes let's through taxes first Wisconsin under the previous Doyle administration was attacks hell\nNo you can be one of those people say I don't care about that but voters pretty loudly sad and I spoke with their votes we don't we're not happy with this being attacked so therefore we're going to let Republicans run the show for a few years\nWhat's happened where every budget surplus when he was three hundred million dollars in the latest budget\n\nTheir budget deficits before Governor Scott Walker took office\nThat's a pretty clear positive for current administration\nThrowing the child tax credit the tax holiday taxes in general being down significantly in the in the the tenure of Governor Scott Walker his eight years that's a win for him what does Tony Evers what can you point to\nSchool budgets are in trouble across the states rising number of referendum in school districts I think is one point four billion dollars on November ... think about that number one point four billion dollars school referendum just on November six\nSo for taxes clearly goes to Governor Walker last one education you can weigh in for one for southern nine nine one six twenty that can work it's talking tax money\nWe have one candidates who works in education former teacher it was a former principal to\nSuper attended a public construction the state of Wisconsin although for the troubled record I Would say at best given student progress in achievement\nThe referendum was point to that as well troubles in school districts across the states and then they just do the plagiarism thing on on that pile\nNot the best look so education for the governor's interesting thing about it is his actual dollar investment K. through twelve education has ramped up\nThe last time he did a budget adding additional dollars for K. through twelve education Tony Evers himself his words called it a pro kid budget\n\nAnd they did all that by lowering the property tax burden on people to stay eaters is proposing at one point four billion\nDollar increase it includes money for students with disabilities of six hundred million dollar increase their know who else I think that's a good thing no one\nIt's it's become increasingly challenging for school district but just because of the larger and larger number every year that's that's put towards students with disabilities it's an important contribution but that's what makes these budget so challenging\n\nAnd lastly on an education if you submit a budgets and a budget proposal that's heavily plagiarized if I was a voter\nI Would look at that that's probably not a great example from someone who prides himself and I've been working the education field for decades\nWhen you were very policy as my friend James wages in pointed out earlier on the show suggests the rules tells you the rules have the time I can blame it on somebody else but again where's the discipline he's already indicated he's not going to discipline anybody for that conduct\nI always say leadership is hard\nIt's not for everybody you can have titles you can have positions of importance Tony Evers as it has one of those it doesn't mean you're a great leader just means you're in that position\nOne of the taxes and the two six to Tony years has been promising everything for a vote I Want to hear how he plans to pay for it even down to his middle class tax credit redoing heroes and giving teachers pay increases the money has to come from somewhere and no one wants to talk about it\nI Can't say it any better than to six to text where's the money coming from Tony or is it more of the throw it against the wall promise everything hope somebody's fooled by

I was making up until game seven of the brewers here at Dodger series\nCame in I even had I even had a wager on Christian yell at scoring the first run in game seven and he did\nSo it it was we had a lot of fun I was in Vegas was my brother I Will say this the ... I I watched the first six innings of the brewers game and then we went to a Jimmy Buffett concert\nThe uh the the crowd in that particular tavern I was in in Vegas was not very forgiving of Craig council that was the general theory was that council blew the game now counselor didn't give up three run home run and I I Do think he was probably a little bit guilty of perhaps over managing but\nHe's young he will learn from that great brewer sees and I think a lot of people are going to be saying hey this team's got a great chance to get to the world series next year and you would certainly think so at the same time I got to recognize how difficult it is to do that\nAnd I hear somebody in the Democratic party started well\nI guess okay you sit and you say the question is don't separate the children so you know let's say let's say the caravan gets here and you've got mom and dad and you've got four children under the age\nOf twelve right what what do you do do arrest them and then detained them all as a family\nNo you don't at rest on your back you don't let them in this country don't near um\nWell how do you turn them back that I mean that's that's of course the problem\nYou can put on guard that harder and say anybody crossing the border well he shot and woman or child and\nI don't think anybody would run up again\nI well I think I I well I I don't\nI I I don't you can't shoot 'em just I mean you you you do I mean\nI mean that the ideas I mean I uh separating them is not a very good solution but the shooting people it is is not the solution either I mean not obvious and see here's the problem under the law and this is why\nThis is why it's been so disappointing to me that we haven't been able to get any sort of consensus on immigration one state cross the border at that point in time what the US law says is that they have to be taken into custody\nThey can in fact be taken into custody right now the policy is not to separate the children from the families because remember we've had this huge issue about separating families the children have to be released and twenty days that's what the law says so you can arrest them you can keep them together\nBut then after twenty days you're supposed to release the children and then you send them into foster care I mean it it it's a stone cold mess it it just it just is\nBecause the idea is how do you stop them the caravan from getting into the country in the first place because once they set foot on the U.S once you step on us soil and there's all sorts of different protections that that arise and of course\nI again if you don't detain people and we've had this conversation before what we've seen happen is you if you just you take people into custody you will come and you say All right come back in thirty days for hearing\nA huge percentage of those people never come back for hearing these sort of disappear into the U. S. for one for seven nine nine one six twenty Tom ... good afternoon\nThank you for taking my you sir\n[laughter] or ... or the you know you come down and do whatever you can have an come over the order on your hands free water we do that far away\nAnd do you think the wall is the way to secure the border\nI rarely do\nWe want them I think they came over and wrap writing but we're the same thing with [noise] um it got to stop it you got to be about reactor\nRight because they go good because once you again once you get onto American soil there's all sorts of these different protections that end up kicking in in my concern about the wall has always been\nI just ... yeah I I've always thought that people go around first of all as a practical matter you can't build a wall along if certain portions of the Mexican us border it's just not it's an impossible to do that\nI'm ... and people always figure out ways to get around this I mean here's I if I were President Trump here here's the first thing I Would be doing I Would be on the phone with the Mexican president\nAnd I'd be trying to work something out that stops the group from getting to the border in the first place\nYou know that's that's what you have to do because it's and that's and in fairness to Mexico and understand people like the beat up on the Mexican government for all sorts of things in fairness to Mexico a lot of these caravans\nHave in fact been broken up before it gets to the U.S border and and that to me is where the battle needs to be fought stopped to group from getting to the U.S border and if the U.S needs to I don't know provide fiscal assistance or something like that to the Mexican government\nTo help make that happen because the reality is once this caravan gets to the United states border you're talking about a completely and totally different picture I think the answer is if it gets to that stage what has to happen is the families have to be arrested\nAnd I think the families need to be taken to kept together but at the same point in time I\nWe're we're running out of places to put it all of a sudden you have five thousand people including men women and children that come into this country I we're running out of detention facilities is to places to keep them which is why the law desperately needs to be changed\nTo allow us to have more freedom\nTo turn people around and send them back where they came from right away and if that sounds heartless I I'm Sorry but the truth is you can't have thousands and thousands of people illegally entering this country on a regular basis for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to daddy and the nominee falls steady or there'll be ...\nI I agree with what to what you just we're getting together with the Mexican government to come under no way shape or form view them in because I heard on one of the\nNPR's or something like that they were they were talking to some of these people and we want to how we want we want you got to keep them under the country until after the election that\nWell I mean yeah I mean I this is I mean the elections coming up in two weeks so this isn't going to happen then but but but let me ask you the tough question Debbie and this is why it's so difficult to deal with this issue [laughter] All right let's say you have a group\n[noise] three three four five six seven thousand people that present themselves in mass at the U.S border\nAnd they start marching on the border what do you tell the even K let's let's say you got to the military that's out there what do you tell them to do you mean our first caller said shoot you can't shoot I mean what what do what do you tell the military to do\nAnd should chair show for me I don't I don't know the answer but um I think you got to stop all of these how can you help 'em before that point because the one I mean\nWhat right do it exactly no that's see that's where\nI see that's where and this is where which this word we use from time to time this is weird to me diplomacy comes in and I mean it it's not just a U.S problem is a U.S problem when they get to the border but it's also a Mexico problem because a lot of times these people again end end up in in\nThere's a lot of times these people again and end up in in Mexico because the caravans don't get all the way here and I I look I understand the optics of this and I got a couple of extra people saying we're a Christian society and we need to be you know opening well I'm Sorry I\n... you know country in the world\nCan can sustain\nCompletely and totally open borders I mean that that's just the reality yes we are a country that has been built on immigration but it's been built on illegal\nImmigration and you can't simply allow thousands and thousands of people to come streaming across the border on a regular basis with no no no assets\nNo way of supporting themselves you can't do that it will overwhelm the country but it will particularly overwhelmed those states that are along the border so I mean the the bottom line is I think you have to end up breaking this off somehow\nIt's going to be interesting if I Am the president\nThis is one where I Am trying to reach out to Mexico and I'm saying okay what do we do collectively\n'cause that's the bottom line you've got to stop this before it gets to the border because once it gets to the border then you're either risking a very ugly confrontation or you're saying ark and we arrest and detain thousands and thousands of people and the question becomes where\nWhat a mess they tune

little perspective\nMega millions the odds of winning again would I say one in three hundred and two million well Powerball though odds are one and two hundred Ninety two million so Powerball is a is a relative I mean it's all relative steal you know ... comparatively a but at the same time it's a smaller thing\n[noise] I I talked to several people back here when I was in Las Vegas because some

drugs now these are people that under normal circumstances would never ever ever\nPlace a bet on anything much less buy a lottery ticket but the idea was well it it's five hundred million dollars or

Knicks said they just send the call our coverage starts at six thirty this evening alright grooves producing the show today and always this is an issue\nThat divides a lot of people in politics and it I I Know that there are people who I like and respect to have a completely different thoughts on this than than me and that is it's\nThe issue of yard signs now Lenny kind of back into this because years and years and years ago when I took the one and only foray into\nThat's because years and years and years ago when I took the one and only foray into\nPolitics is my wife is listening I promise it with the one and only foray into politics there are all these people send you gotta get yard signs and I was wanting a statewide race yard signs back then were expensive I mean comparatively they they were they were expensive\nAnd you know people would sign up for them and that's great because the it it's a way that somebody can go out in support their cat they can put a sign in their yard but did I mentioned yard signs are are expensive\nAnd when the person lives in a cul de sac or whatever you put the yard sign up there and maybe four or five of their neighbors end up seeing them I came to the conclusion that I think as a general rule yard signs are essentially useless\nThey again to the extent that it gives somebody who feel strongly about a candidate it gives them it gives them a chance to go out and express that support in a visible way by sticking that sign in in their yard and there is I guess a value to that\nI don't know anybody\nIn my life who has ever decided to vote for or against the candidate with one exception would tell you about\nFor because like your neighbor has a yard sign up all my neighbors gotta sign up saying they support grew I'm going to go vote grow now I I Do admit that you know in my old neighborhood there was this guy who was wrong on every issue\nAnd on some local candidates when I saw and I didn't know anything about the particular race and it's so this guy had a yard sign for the candidate it told me to go the other way\nBut as far as the major candidates that that that people know about you know Glenn growth miniature congressman All right Jim Sensenbrenner is your congressman is a growth yard sign or a yard sign for whoever's running against growth Sensenbrenner yard sign or does it Tony ... yard sign\nDoes that adds a value now I understand that there's a lot of very experienced political operatives out there who I respect their opinion who who believe that okay this is the grass roots you got to get the yard signs out there this is how you communicate\nMight take has always been again beyond the value of giving somebody something concrete to do to express the fact that they support a candidate beyond that fact\nYard signs don't change votes at at All right for one for seven nine nine when six twenty as he ... mortgage talk ... but let's see this up and I'm legitimately curious\nDo you think yard signs or ineffective campaign tool\nDo you decide gee I I'm going to vote for a candidate or not vote for a candidate because I saw a half dozen yard signs that are up there and I do understand that yard signs become somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy because sometimes people will tell me\nOh I did this particular candidate is that they're they're they're in trouble because you know in my neighborhood they're all these other yard signs for the opposing candidate and almost always\nWell in in those particular cases people then surprise when the guy or the gal that hit the fewer yard signs they ended up winning big time for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the ... mortgage talk and text line do yard signs make a difference is your vote\nEver influenced by a again\nA yard sign that you might see\nAll right let's see a score a text line I Do feel that for smaller positions name recognition goes a long way for example someone might not vote and two weeks specifically for Walker fevers but they might not know other names I'm On the ballot so that comes down to name recognition um especially for names that might not look like they sound\nI again I I I think that\nFor some people there is a value I I I guess in in you know you get destroy your support the candidate but again I don't know anybody in real life who has ever said\nI'm going to vote for so and so because my neighbor has a yard sign or I saw driving to work I saw six yard signs that said bill stat for Congress so I'm going to vote for Bill set for Congress I just don't think that's how the real world works\nAnd if you understand how expensive yard signs are\nAnd we need to distribute it to people who do not have money and this idea that there's free stuff out there\nThis will have the appeal and and now this is becoming sort of a common place mainstream kind of thing although it's interesting the criminal heritage from California and all you have to look at California and California because of policies like this has become a complete and total fiscal train wreck\nBut that's not stopping people from blast and a half so anyhow late last week Camilla Harris and again she wants to be president she came out with this plan saying here's what I Want to do I want to\nGet rid of the Trump tax cuts you know what what Congress did the tax reform act and I honestly\nI I'm I'm One of the things I'm kind of curious about is when they sit down or actually have my accountants you sit down and do the taxes I don't know whether I'm going to be better off or worse off you know under the new tax thing I just I I I don't because I'm going to lose some deductions I'm going to gain some I don't know how it's going to all work out\nBut anyhow she says you know what she says the problem is that the people who have money in this country they don't pay enough in taxes\nAnd what the Republicans did and what President Trump did with tax reform that just made the problem worse so what she said is look I Want to I Want to repeal all these tax cuts I Want to go back to the way things were and then what I Want to do with the money\nIs I Want to give\nFamily it's up to six thousand dollars a year\nJust free money here's what she says she wants to do she wants to create a new tax credit\nFor up to three thousand dollars for individuals or six thousand dollars for households you could receive your money in a lump sum after filing your tax return so if you filed the tax return after you've ... you could get six thousand dollars in cash back\nOr you could get an installment every month or two hundred and fifty to five hundred dollars you could just get a check from the government\nUm the credits would be refundable which means that even if you didn't do any taxes\nYou get the money anyhow so even if you were the in that what's the number now forty six forty seven forty eight percent of Americans who don't pay any federal income tax you would nevertheless you would still qualify to get your three or six thousand dollars back now you might say to me what yeah\nWhat what what exactly is a working class family who is going to get this money back\nAnd under the Harris plan households earning up to one hundred thousand dollars would be eligible\nSo if you make under one hundred thousand dollars she would give you six thousand dollars back\nRight for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that if he acted mortgage talk and text line free money from the government\nLet's take the money that I don't know the evil rich people half\nThat they don't work for and that they don't need\nSo let's take that money from them and then let's give it to everybody else regardless of whether people pay taxes are not\nThree thousand dollars for individuals six thousand dollars for families wouldn't that be a great thing I mean couldn't everybody just enjoy getting six thousand dollars from the federal government who\nWould object to that\nFor one for seven nine nine when six twenty there's the ac unit mortgage talking text find All right so let's see this up what do you think would that be a wonderful thing to all of a sudden have the federal government giving\nWell pretty much the vast majority of people probably three to six thousand dollars back and you can have it every month if you want or you can have it you know it just in a lump sum is there such a thing\nAs a free lunch for one for seven nine nine what six twenty we'll discuss in just moment if you're on the line to sit on its one forty three Jeff Wagner WTO O.
