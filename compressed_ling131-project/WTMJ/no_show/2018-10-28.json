to you what's going to think congressman going broke we got to get you back in Studio soon\nAbsolutely next time on Capitol dry All right\nGood to see if I thanks for coming on congressman Yup I always wanted to talk to a as I said there's a lot going on and we'll keep you up to date on the way to stories in the news is next to Jim Jim\nBunning was nine away with you on this Wednesday don't forget our show bull is oftentimes sweaters Siamese WGN journey see the question Netflix is out with his second season\nOf making her murder\nSteven every guilty or innocent simple as that you can weigh in on on the Twitter poll will do that every day on the show going forward so there's your opportunity\nAlso unnecessary swing W changes for the page as well joining us now is outstanding attorney general hosted in Wisconsin branch demo good morning\nTo monitor the how are you good so you had a big meeting I think it was last night's or this week I Know the opioid and mess problem in the state what are we what are we learning about that problem is as all of us in the state of Wisconsin and\nIt seems like we all know someone or nor salmon it's been affected by this what are we learning about how are we dealing with it\nYeah that is effectively I it it will cost everybody if you if it's not your family is somebody you know well and that that's true for almost every Wisconsin I [noise]\nWell what we have learned is that we have to work at a collaborative comprehensive approach to this forever we have gone after drug problems by going after only ... the supply side\nWell it's never worked and we shouldn't have been surprised because as long as the demand exists somebody is going to spend the money or said with somebody is going to be willing to sell drugs to people who are willing to spend money to buy drugs you have to address the supply side and we are doing that very effectively as\nWe call hosted that event yesterday with the two U.S attorneys in the eastern and western district of Wisconsin and local law enforcement with the Milwaukee police department and among others\nWhen we've ever work better as federal state and local partners but we also have to go beyond just than just going after the drug dealers we've got to address why are people using trucks and so this conference yesterday had over five hundred people and many of those many of them were\nHealthcare specialists treatment a experts a victim advocates bond force prosecutor social services public health we had everyone together and we know that\nWe know that we've got to get more treatment in place for people suffering we've built it since two thousand fourteen when I took office um we had twenty nine counties with treatment alternative and diversion court programs in Wisconsin we now have fifty one\nAnd two tribal communities and we're going to work to keep growing that for some of the smaller county it's hard for them to have the economy of scale to operate a court tired of the staff you need to do it but we're going to work we're going to keep working on ways that regional court so that we can get that available to every county\nWe've got to figure out why do people start using in the first place we know often times it is traumatic experiences people have his children mhm teachers telling me that by kindergarten and first grade they know which kids\nAre going to be using drugs by the time they're in junior high\nWe've never taken advantage of that knowledge before we are now going to take advantage of that that's why with our school safety Gratz were requiring schools and requiring makes it sound like they're resisting because they're welcoming test\nBut schools are now going to be training every single full time staff member in adverse childhood experiences and the trauma informed care\nAnd then ten percent of the school staff are going to get adolescent mental how advanced adolescent mental health training and we're going to safety intervention teams all\nOf this is designed to when we identify those kids that are struggling to do something about it to get services plugged into that child into their family\nTo make sure that they don't become the kid at in junior high that's using drugs or engaging in violence an acting out will be able to prevent more kids from using drugs to deal with rent more kids from engaging in violence in our schools all of that is going to make her sit safer in stronger long term\nWe're talking to Wisconsin surgeon read Simone WGM say let me ask you about the story I read the other day about the DNA backlog I went to one did you get your take on why that is\nAnd what we're doing in the state of Wisconsin to address that\nYeah there's a whole lot of factors that are playing a role in this one of them is a year and a half ago the FBI increase the um [noise] there there are different locations on a person's DNA strand\nAnd the [noise] I'm trying to think of the right word here are\nPlus we use before could only we we can only passed\nCertainty to a certain number of locations will now were you able to look at more locations that gives us more certainty ... when we get a DNA in our resolve that increased the number of books\nIt's well now we're able to look at more locations that gives us more certainty ... when we get a DNA in our resolve\nThat increased the number of locations that are scientists look out by forty percent which doubles their work\nSo he was doing that we made it harder for them to produce the results we get better science we get more of a liability and that's a good thing\nBut that they've increased the work we also saw we've also seen law enforcement better train thanks for the work we've done it the OJ to collect more evidence so at crime scenes that brings in more cases of evidence to help ... people guilty\nWe've also expanded the use of our of our crime lab crime scene response teams we have one and all three labs\nThat go to a crime scenes to help elect that really minute that really difficult to find evidence\nAs a result we've got more evidence the tests that my first two years in office we saw submissions to the crime lab for evidence testing caught\nBy eight percent ... that's ... you can't expect your staff that was that was stretched all ready to handle that\nAre you going after additional staffing and and and and budget dollars to deal with this yep\nYes we are now we didn't jump right to that because we first stop I transferred some other conditions from other parts of the OJ to the crime labs\nWe also created forensic biology that are helping keep the analysts at their desks or the analysts do their work and some other scientists can do work that you don't need the analysts to do the analyst at the most expensive most valuable person not our lab they take a year and a half to train to do DNA work and\nThere there's a lot of competition for them out there in the private sector so they get poached from us\nSo we need to keep them at their lab do at the bench doing their work we also created some uh some forensic scientist that go to the crime scenes that we can keep again keep the analysts doing their work those things started to make a difference but we've seen that the submissions have continued to grow\nSo we hired and outside an outside source the national forensic science it but you came in and conducted analysis of our lab concluded what we're doing it was all the right direction but we were going to need to tire more of those same people\nSo that's what we've proposed in our budget submission that we're going to put fourteen more of those forensic scientists in our labs that are going to do that work and the national Science Institute believes that that will that will resolve our issues\nLast thing for you were talking to Wisconsin attorney general branch him on WGM Jay the breaking news story the last couple of days and said these explosive devices found that the homes\nAh George Soros yesterday today family the offices of rock Obama former presidents and a ... bill and Hillary Clinton as we've seen the attention and the instability rise in this country is this a byproduct of that do you think\n[noise] boy that that takes it to another level that it isn't the every day people kind of angrily shouting at each other at dangerous I I'm Amazed that someone was able to get those devices into places where I Would think there's pretty heavy security\nHook like Mr Soros as well protected should be and on this ... this is frightening and we do need to tone down his rhetoric\nWhen you've got to start we've got to start recognizing that we solve a lot of problems working together you know when you talk about the opiate epidemic\nThose things are supported by putting a bipartisan way in our state legislature the hope legislation office of school safety both bipartisan legislation mhm the need to focus more on recognizing that when it comes to a really important things an awful lot of the time we do work together well and stop yelling at each other\nLet's let's let people run on the merits lets people let people talk about ideas to uh to get reelected instead of this this rhetoric that we hear this but\nI don't know why and political out this is all contributing to it\nLet me ask you I only got about a minute left but I I Know you're you're in an election battle and and and I think experience matters is one of the reasons\nHave you on the shows because I respect the work that you do the hard work in law enforcement does which has been received a lot of push back in the last few years talking about your race and the fact that ... and I think in my mind it comes down to experience\nWell I've been twenty nine years as a prosecutor right here in Wisconsin my own it introduces himself as a former federal prosecutor but he's never prosecuted under Wisconsin law you ever work with crime victims here\nYou've never done a sexual assault case in fact when we look at his record we find he only had twenty five cases assigned to him\nIn federal court system I've got nearly sixteen thousand criminal cases that have handled in Wisconsin\nThat's why I got the support of one hundred and fourteen elected district attorneys insurers including far more Democrats\nAbsolutely and that was one of the first challenge is that I face was holy cow this is a you know one ton piece of steel just over one time and how do we support this so I reached out to some of my professional contacts\nI'm an engineer and he gave me some advice as to what we might need to do and that it was actually possible because you get an artist concept that doesn't always translate into reality\nI'm so that was a there was one of the first steps in uh\nMaking sure this could happen and Peter what's your and how did you get about a dozen ... asked me [laughter]\n... previously\nOr we work together um\nI work for flights a landscaping around the corner and principal a landscape designer and so he needed that and so I volunteered to help\n'em and so then I came up with the the whole design of a site why was it important to be involved in the project well I've been out to nine eleven site and it was very moving for me and I\nCouldn't raise my hand fast enough\nWhen you see a different side does that add some are either influences are there and pressures how does that work when you say okay I Want to replicate or at least you bring something to like hearing he walk him that isn't the same in New York or Washington but also has some meaning in depth to it\nWhen I tried to do was using the monitor that you don't never forget so instead of just creating a memorial we wanted to create conflict teaching center so you know they're Fifteen sixteen year olds were born alive when this happened\nAnd it's so close to us or me who are older but there are people that it's not\nSo in their face or in their um so you're not just consciousness as much as I said we went through it or were there when I heard about where everybody knows where they were when it happened\nI'm teaching him how did you incorporate that into your design so and so what we did was I or what I did was billed as the are designed a ring of of trees inside that ring there was an amphitheater where it's raised where people can sit and listen to someone talk about the event [noise]\nI'm In the middle of the um circle is this Pentagon shaped desk\nI'm In honor of the victims you know of that event and on top of that is where the beams going to stand so it's going to be very traumatic as people look at whoever's speaking they don't have to have been pointing at New York will be very dramatic\nDustin when you first started to take part in this project have you noticed anything since then what what is raise your eyebrows what have you felt how is this gone as you've gone through this process\nUm for me it was it was just the awareness I mean I've been working on this for four and a half years now\nAnd just getting out there and talking to people and uh you know young but as you said before the younger generation that\nDid not experienced is emotionally I'm there all the come up and talk to us and touched the beam and you know some of us tell them that they're going to be enlisting in you know in the military um because they want because as far as continue to go on today and they want to they want to help\nAnd um you know personally my my stories that my daughter is nine years old she was actually born on nine eleven and she came home a from first grade with a book about the terrorist attacks and that just a you know sent chills on my spine that you know because of my involvement\nBecause this is in the schools\nUm in the community people are learning about it and they're asking questions about it and they're not easy questions to answer but at least people are talking about it and that's what's important to me\nAnd one thing we should point out to ... as we raised this being one of the one of the aspects that I find so important and said you'll still be able to touch it correctly can actually put your hand on the beam even if in the air and for some people like tactical experience actually could help in some way as you try to comprehend what happens\nIs there's some challenges for either want to use some chance we have something that is that big and that heavy to to build it in a way that's one incredibly impressive to people that come up on it but also save for all the people that do come upon this thing\nThat I think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this in the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolated from\nWhere he had his reign of trees that surrounds the space and and making it more intimate\nThis outdoor room that really isolated from\nWe have this ring of trees that surrounds this space in and make it more intimate\nUm ...\nYou can surrounded by the states you're almost cuddled are held by it\nAnd the significance of the tree that we use that surrounds it is the pear tree I'm On the site there was one survivor tree after the accident which was this ornamental ... for taking that as the symbolism of the rings around this whole space\nAnd then um\nAnd that again creates this kind of intimate space where you're not just out in this field and on and we want it to kind of have this kind of play the feeling when you're in that area\nHave you been amazed at how many different people or businesses or services have wanted to help with this just it's amazing to me how many different aspects of the community are involved\nOh absolutely I mean when I was first asked to do this it was through a former band director to us from high school and I thought I was just coming into you know offer my professional expertise which at the time was architecture [noise]\nUm but then it quickly evolved into this\nA huge community project in this little town in ... has this strong connection to New York um but as as things started turning in as we started getting a established as a Bible once the three and as a as a legitimate organization in the eyes of the community\nYou have a bike stolen landscaping that you know couldn't raised his hand fast enough\nYou have growth designed group that offered their services to help us and particularly legally which you guys have heard about a singer and go so earlier in the weekends and other community members that have offered their their income labor to help so it's really uh it's it's just the fabric of America that's coming together to help us build this project\nIt's got to be a great project to be involved with just the ones that the work that you do and and how that ties in to the creation of this memorial to just the fact that you can take pride in something that you are you you've put your heart and soul into and and that will be viewed by people going for a long long pass all of us being on this planet it's gotta\nBe a great thrill it's wonderful to come up with the symbolism throughout the whole site and their little things we did um for instance there was an oak tree that's\nSeven hundred and fifty four inches from the center of the monument which is how many miles and this from costs come to New York and that is kind of and the swamp oaks is one of the books that they use on the platform after nine eleven memorial in New York I'm\nIn that old tree is really ... remember Andrea who died ah\nOn on that day from Costco\nAnd one of the things that I Know the government family Andrea's parents and her sister often say to that it's not just about to off it's not just about the ... family that this is so much larger than most of the Wisconsin nine eleven memorial I we want you to help\nWe have so many people that are involved in this but it's not enough we need some more healthy so please if you have a couple of dying you can spare for one for seven nine nine one six twenty detects the word tears\nC. A. R. E. S. two for one for seven and then when we will send you back all the information that we try to raise the beam\nWe it's a forty thousand dollar effort it stays wanting to do really no pun intended get this off the ground and really get it flying they they're so close to just breaking ground and getting this rowing so for one for seven and nine months six twenty ... care see A. R. E. S. or you can go to W. team dot com of course\nAnd we have all the rain dreams and everything involved there as well\nHere and doesn't get to the ball to you I I enjoy the enthusiasm and for the project look forward to seeing the complete a memorial out of a sudden you ask them you can help us raised up being WGN Jake cares all that information on our website W team did I count more than ...\nFor the United states really with you on WGM ... we're going to continue to monitor the news from New York Washington DC and explosive device yeah explosive\nDevices sensor the Obamas to the Clintons to the CNN bureau in New York and now we're learning that an explosive device was also sent to the White House where it was intercepted let's get the very latest on this story from ABC News\nIs nailed to the home of former Presidents Clinton and Obama and part of the time Warner center in New York City has been evacuated after an alarm went off during a CNN broadcast another package was sent there now the White House's commenting the\nWhite House had been a statement it can dance what it called the violent impact frequently made against for President Obama the contents and quote or their public figures there was no explicit reference to George Soros I finally found earlier this week in home mailbox at the billionaire secretary than than this as an estate in close\nCaribbean acts are despicable and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law parents habits ABC News the White House packages\nIntercepted by the secret service one addressed Hillary Clinton at her home in New York the other address to Iraq about I Can't tell them and D.C can taint pipe bomb like devices they appear similar to the one said earlier this week the Democratic donor George Soros sharing precedent ABC News\nSo CNN reporting that another suspicious package with a device was addressed to the White House it was intercepted added joined base in Washington DC according to law enforcement the device was similar to the one center sources home in similar to the one sent to the Clintons and Obama\nAll of those places being threatened by this story today so we'll keep you posted on that that is number one of our for at sand the four biggest source as we see across Milwaukee\nState in the world number two\nWe've talked about it before the Milwaukee health departments now facing criminal investigation\nWhat does this all mean would break it down for your next right here in the ... they really on this Wednesday on WGM Jay we're in the middle of our for at times I'll forget the have a chance to win more he's symphony orchestra tickets for\nA have a fun thing a holiday or Hollywood celebration the music of Hollywood but you've got to get a rights or write 'em down if you have to be for a time the Ford biggest stories as we see across Milwaukee the state in the world number two Eric it's not a news story per se market health department issues with their their a\nResponse to the the lead water situation the ladder roles and the impact on Milwaukee citizens health but now pending criminal investigations into that department\nSolomon Tonys or Lenski had issued a press release we had seen if they they sent it out to everybody questioning why Bevan Baker hadn't been subpoenaed\nAnd testifying before a city hall on the whole waters you with the health department Bevan Baker you may recall a had resigned abruptly not that long ago because of the situation where they were doing a lot of Bateman process properly there's a lot of issues within the at the health department\nAnd over the last few months we've tried to here I'm sure other news agencies have is well we've reached out Tibetan Baker into his lawyer aim I always get the same response back basically saying I Will let him know that you've requested\nAn interview and usually that's all you've ever heard the ah so ... was questioning why wouldn't we bring him in a year from the man himself for now is Sean the Hamilton the Milwaukee common council president says the reason is because there is a criminal investigation\nInto the matter and that's why for now we have not heard from back and pick\nUp on the underside of all them in twenty so is he slammed the county Hamel decision not to subpoena Baker\nAny he issued a statement actually saying accused him of playing politics with the health and safety of our citizens delayed delayed delays seems to be the president's monster hair referring to president a shot to animals in the real issue is transparency transparency and shoots the citizens and families of Milwaukee deserve so they still haven't gone back and forth on this Hamilton comes back\nAccused accuses the whiskey who uh who has already announced remarkably so but he's a twenty twenty mayoral candidate a grandstanding here's one Hamilton said I'm not interested in wasting staff and council members time it's a great a spectacle that were ... nothing but an opportunity for you to grandstand on the issue I come down to Phyllis inside here\nLet's get to the facts of the case let's find out what's who's responsible for the delays for the bad communication maybe in some cases the retribution that was rain down upon health department employees for not producing information not letting them tell people about what was happening in their departments\nBottom line is people can be affected by these decisions or lack of decision and lack of leadership\nWhether it's a shot the Hamilton are better than Baker I think Tony Snow skis on the something here you have to ask these questions let's get Bevan bakers subpoenas we can find out what the real answers are I understand the politics I understand Tony's Lewinsky's throwing his hat into a race that hasn't even been gun yes\nThere's always going to be that when you're talking about elected official doesn't anyone to take a shot the Hamilton has some career aspirations when it comes to a higher office\nHands mayor of Milwaukee\nSome career aspirations when it comes to a higher office\nHans Mayer Milwaukee\nThey're not no one's immune from this but the bottom line is the citizens of Milwaukee deserve answers on their health and if you have any health departments and as someone who led that department the words and his conduct matter and\nThat's what I think all of them and twenties was getting so we've also reached out to all the other Muslims because he wants to talk about this and I I don't think we've heard back yet but uh I don't I don't think that a shot the Hamilton president Hamilton is right when he said that someone is leaning on his leadership\nIs asking tough questions questions that should be asked\nLast thing from Hamilton whereas the city trying to respond a probably a properly to this crisis while you and your conferences offer only criticism and conspiracy theories wrapped and misinformation and confusion so as you're a leader I asked that you're excused yourself from the table when when the hard decisions are being made\nOr I by God's will it will excuse you again that's ...\nI'm not sure where he's going with that and again let's let's mute the politics out of it let's get to the bottom\nOf this and figure out what is the problem here who dropped the ball what we can do and how we can fix it classic Milwaukee problem\nPolitics overcoming overriding everything else not fixing the problems that exist get the politics out of its ultimate Filin skis and and\nPresident Hamilton are both welcome to come on the show and getting their side of the story so that's number two of our forests and the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the states\nAnd the world that little worked up on that one Eric with that I think it's important that when you when the health and safety are citizens are on on the on the table I think we have to think about what we're doing number three more positive story brewers wrap up there twenty Eighteen season with a press conference yesterday maybe Stearns prayed council of bringing some of that next right here to be a teenager or just sort of elections\nRaces standing for governor and us\nSenate John McHugh checked Semitic Capitol reporter at five twenty Wisconsin's afternoon Jenna Melissa of course three to six right here in Louisiana Jay was I was watching the world\nSeries last night between the red Sox and the Dodgers I Want to still since the brewers would have been in that series but yet we're watching I watched a little bit of it you know it's hard to get out of that baseball haven't once you have it and I watch every pension every inning either in person\nOr on the radio or on TV I'll be adults yeah so I I'm kind of in that mode now so I watched about three or four innings last night\nDidn't really hurt you did it last night was that what it really hits you that's when it really hit me where I'm like oh so\nSo I told Jean I was I was thinking as these situations were unfolding that game you know ... coming up price coming up what clerk credit council would have done in that situation or who you would have banned it I mean so you're still in that mindset and and it is sad but at least um there's some\nClosure I we played the the great piece by our own one of our producers Ashton route and the other day kind of wrapping up to the sounds of the season what was great to hear from David Stern and quite consciously yesterday as they kind of put a a bow tie on and what was an incredible twenty teens\nYeah they held the end of your news conference at Miller Park stern says they have no regrets\nIt was a close series and one seven games and win serious got seven days they're generally very evenly matched teams I thought these are two very easily match games and certainly both teams to say that they played well enough to move on I'm at the end of the day that the Dodgers played a really good game in game seven of abs and and they deserve to go to the world series\nSo now we look to next year right Steve who is coming\nBack from a specific standpoint conditional standpoint at the major league level we have the vast majority of our T returning\nAnd so I don't know that I Would point a particular area or two that we see that that absolutely must be addressed but there are really the opportunities to improve our team and the off season we're going to work harder to take advantage of those opportunities that\nI I certainly imagine that we all shop is free training with a slightly different lucky roster than than the one we have right now perhaps a way that that we don't veggies\nAnd there are three pitchers that I Know they are very high on a brand new ... of carbon burned and Freddie Peralta and their futures lip bright according to ...\nI think we had a high degree of belief in in those three guys I'm you or what we saw in September and October though those three guys are pitchers who we believe have the ability to be impact fishers nasally level um\nTo some extent they've already shows and I said they certainly show there is a camera in October so we we expected those guys to to be a big part of our future and one capacity or another and and I still think they're going to be a big future\nSo I Know Jeff is he's not watching the world series you you're obviously in you'll you'll take part so we'll Stearns indoor council wants the class\nIf I'll watch it if is is it going to be painful but but I'll watch it and and uh you get to watch two very good teams go at it for for a chance to be a champion for\nA man I'll definitely watch it a hundred percent it's look it's it's really high level baseball is fun to see it you know from my perspective there is things to pick up on and learn and\nUnderstand situational lay strategically you know what happens in these games we we play all these regular season games are still much smaller sample of of play off games\nAnd to to kind of sift through and learn from so they're they're very valuable in that regard\nSo the ah the last comments probably we will hear for a while from David Stern and credit counseling from last comments but as we wind up twenty eight CNN look it was a great run fantastic season or\nBy all accounts success you don't and everybody doesn't win the world series ever does it get to go to the world series that became one game away from being able to do that and say that so I I give my uh lots of credit to both David ... and credit card so we're in good hands and the brewers organization\nThe owner of course mark ... CEO as well um we're in good shape and uh actually are sports franchises in general most states ah we're we're in good hands him\nA sports fans are well treated and they all all those franchises do a really great job with engaging\nHear that somebody who who digests a lot of newspaper concept mostly on line it's interesting you go to all these different websites always papers across the state and saw the same concept so you can really have an easy process I Want to ask you quickly about journalism in the age of Donald Trump presidents\nWho uh is I I used the term uncharacteristically on presidential in the way he communicates and do you think that's been a challenge for journalists to kind of push aside some of the by especially we've seen some Jim Acosta ... of the world but Caitlin columns already announced that seem to have a running battle with the president\nHad well two things I guess it applies to Governor Walker's while there's a lot of criticism all their Governor Walker and the Trump machine and that is that is completely appropriate right and the longer somebody who's in office as with our current governor more Christmas and he's going to get from journalists and as it should be so\nSo criticism yes but when you have somebody like the New York times during the election that comes just outright and says that they see it as um if out their mission um\nYou know I guess part of their of of of of the way they're going to proceed\nOr to actually work against Donald Trump has essentially what they did that that's that's that's not right by the SAT on your editorial page I shouldn't be happening in the news pages so uh I mean I think there's a lot of admission that you have again some advocacy journalism going on\nIt does it certainly seems like that a couple of minutes left with Mike Nichols from the badger Institute there's a great piece by ritual ... W women's studies programs and or maybe they lack of ideological diversity ... hundred courses now\nRight offered right and ah [laughter]\nThat's a tour after tour to that page and read read some of these courses actually Steve I'm so you know simply undergraduate rather undergraduate courses that you W and the gender and women's studies program\nYou know race gender colonization capitalism sex and power and Greece gender migration um the female body in the world uh you know then there's a we have a bunch of stuff in here about who the who the professors are and what they write but\nYou know the big question there you know if you imagine now there's one of the biggest women and gender studies programs in the country is second only to another Big Ten school Michigan\nAnd or is this really is this really an academic discipline or is it activism and if it is a discipline should there be as much activism as there is there there's a perspective there and I'm a should we really be be funding activism uh at at at it with our tax dollars\nYou know eat typically the way our country works as things go in cycles are waves but in in the liberalization of of our educational institutions there is no there's no way there's no cycle just if it continually ramps up when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting degrees and\nIt's hard to be I'm optimistic about the future of those institutions when you see that kind of course we'd be court for being generated there\nIt's tough work trying to uh\nIt's hard to be optimistic about the future of those institutions when you see that kind of course with the course of being generated there it's tough we're\nTrying to reach out to you know a lot of kids there are there are there are kids who are fair minded\nNow want to learn how open minded at U. W. Madison as hard as it is of leaders conservatives I'm there are all across this country and we've written we've written about it actually but uh yeah it takes some courage to be a conservative a and a spouse or your views let let alone turning a paper that you know you're progressive professor isn't gonna like Steve has\nExactly right Mike Nichols president the bathrooms and see what I I we met last weekend or or how can they find out more about your your publication digging and all the great stories that you do\nI'm sure so I can go to our website I have some uh WWW dot badger Institute dot org and you'll find it all their um send me an email like badger Institute ...

continue update on the latest on the explosive devices found\nEither on their way and routes or ask the homes of George Soros and the Clintons in chapel in New York the Obamas and uh the work that's being done CNN was threatened or that's suspicious device was sent there as well causing a a\nAlmost a widespread panic as they were getting alarms as they were broadcasting a gym shoot ... some of the other hosts have to actually the building them we're broadcasting from the streets outside CNN so there's a lot of uh information out there they're going to bring in the latest on that and a few minutes on the on the news coming out but in the next ... foreign talking about something more technology related\nAnd it has to do with a decision about a country\nIn this case countries Sweden we've we've touched it on that story here with ... with the company three square market and they have I think about sixty five employees now\nThan it microchips embedded in their hands between their summer for finger\nOnce waiting at this idea has caught on in a big way in some of the ways are using this technology I think are going to be\nA thing that uh some folks not all but some of the United states are going to want to think about and constant place to make life easier I'll tell you what those things are the details how that works or after the news on friday touched on another story as well\nWe talked a lot about single payer healthcare on the show the other day\nWhen I looked at the Democrats that are running in the house races across the country would be surprised to know that in half of those races\nThose Democrats are advocating for free health care for all that's an interesting dynamic as we look at the ... elections November six really voting starting already\nVoters trying to decide who to vote for a while if you knew of half the Democrats were ... were sponsoring are supporting free health care for all does that change your mindset to the independent voter the voters that really matter in this election does that make you give you pause\nSo I'll give you some details about that as well but we'll start as I said with the\nMicrochip story thousands of Swedes getting microchips inserted into\nTheir hands who thought Wisconsin would lead the way on that story but that's next votes are starting to make themselves known by starting the seas with three wins and zero losses are back at it from five serve foreign for a nationally televised mess with the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers had Davis is on the call and our coverage starts at eight o'clock tonight bus going for for ... no\nI think they can do it here at All right here in the beauty I'm Jake ... gets to the microchip store just the latest as we know it's on the explosive devices story that we uh broke earlier this morning so here's what we know there was an early this week there was a device are located at the home of George Soros um the\nGovernment has the law enforcement has identified packing some to the Clintons in Obama's now this report that the DNC former DNC had Debbie Wasserman Schultz congresswoman from Florida her offices have been evacuated CNN's offices were evacuated the package some there\nWas apparently addressed the ex CIA director Brennan who has appeared on CNN\nOr the one that was taken from CNN is nowadays screening facility to determine what exactly it is\nSo this is just the last three plus hours I mean there's all sorts of very early in the morning when I Am at the Clinton residents but uh the public part of this was the last several hours so that the story is fairly fresh\nNot allowed to known other than the fact that these threats in these devices were mailed to former government officials are in some cases as as is the case with Debbie Wasserman Schultz currents elected officials or nothing about motive who might be responsible but I made the connection here\nWe've seen rhetoric and the violence ramp up\nFrom both sides\nAnd stuff on the left right wing white nationalist white supremacy groups on the rights\nDoesn't shock me at all that we're seeing these types of stories play out and I we this may be completely unrelated to politics\nAnd the rhetoric of violence that's playing out but I may not be and what will stay on that story line as it develops but a lot of breaking news on today's show related to explosive devices as it I said the middle of the one device removed from CNN is now at a screening facility and they will do try to determine\nIf as was the case with the George Soros explosive device you know it was rather crude and designed\nShifting topics and shifting gears slightly here and you can weigh in as well for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I Love this topic I Love talking about technology to begin with\nA well back early on in the tenure or my ten year on T. M. J. we end up ... we talked about the three square marketing company in Wisconsin\nWho had to ask their employees are the ones that have been a micro shift microchip between their thumb and forks finger sees the process of law games with the computer or buying items in their snack bar opening and closing some some of the doors at the facility\nAnd I and I love that story because I I think they had about another couple of hundred employees he got like fifty to sign up for staying if they've they've ramped it up like sixty five or Seventy five now that have these device\nSo I saw this story a from Europe and if you don't know part of the part of the thing you get to do and you're on the radio shows you've just spent a lot of time reading and I read this story about sweet\nAnd they're jumping into this thing in a big way\nAt this moment for thousands sleeves have implanted similar microchip like the one at three square market utilizes that contains information about their identity they can use these things these four thousand people to get cash like an ATM cash tickets\nThey use it for access to buildings and facilities parking and even social media and you're thinking about\nThis technology and and the the limits and some of the questions that it raises\nAnd one of the big ones is cause somebody hack into your system of your body 'cause it's things inside your own body could they do and there's companies that are looking at that as well\nJune twenty twenty Seventeen so go back a year so we just train out ... hundred people were using microchips to pay for the train trips\nYou could read the trip with a smartphone when they can come from the past years paid for their journey so that that's as easy as it gets and again it's it's simply injected really into your your hand between your thumb and therefore finger\nBottom large Swedish company is now I'm implanting employees with microchips\nAs I said to use credit cards train tickets they use this is called near field communication NFC technology same as the contact with credit cards is we have mobile payments and it only has to be a few centimeters away the two things are two devices the\nMicrochip and a device communicates the implants are passive\nHave to gain a out of it the other thing that jam\nIn at ... in in second Timothy it clearly states that land that will not look after his own household is worse than an infidel we're not looking after our own and I think it is the young disgraceful that we have millions of veterans in eight\nYears there's no doubt about the fact that we often do not on the do not do enough for our veterans point well taken Charlotte I I Would have to agree with you completely in that regard I joined in Pittsburgh on the boat had a job in the evening Joan\n\nOr put another way Joan in Pittsburgh hello Joan or the gene I'm sure it's G. guy sorry I uh go ahead Jean\nAlright hum my question I have not heard any news media or anybody address is it a caravan of this magnitude doesn't just spontaneously happen\nAll of a sudden though these people in these countries have been oppressed for decades mhm\nThat's running body has to be leading this at all clear on this somebody organized ahead is paying for it who I mean how how are they\nMhm that's running body has to be leading this edge right clam does somebody organized\nThan it is paying for it who I mean how how are these people eating how are they sleeping are they going to the bathroom I mean that's a lot of people\nYou know words the expos they on the leadership of this group who's paying them it seems to me if somebody could figure that out which I Would think that our government's already looked into this\nThat that would disclose the true nature of what why this thing is happening like you know figuring out who's in charge and who's paying them your problem it\nYes I think the the there's absolutely a somewhat behind this ah if it is a a ... a Americans\nThat wouldn't surprise me at all of\nA judicial watch president Tom ... says that there is evidence that this is a care about is comprised mostly of military age males and was in fact financed by people in

Guatemalan border and they are given a rehearsed answer this is not politics this is about poverty\nShe tweeted that there were women and children but they were at the front of a caravan smaller numbers none would say who the organizers are several said that it was in fact organizers so yes I think ah the short answer gene is that the you're absolutely correct and that is precisely what we're

other particularly on history ... and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nOr you know what to do ... yeah right well how did you do but you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impact that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works out or if if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approve this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters she's referring\nTo her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in it no so I wrote a book you write it again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme as you know in the the she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put\nInto that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they're looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Arab just what it is yes I got to let these people do not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because that's what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in the polling is the independents that they're they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats for what it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ... data extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term\nWord right ah but\nThis is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\n\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a call ...\n... it because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions do outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races\nAnd other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so\nThat's the effect is that combat one Harris or or I was with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going on or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point I come out with Harris or you know as side with as you're crazy Democrats\nShe as she just did as having just [laughter] and\nWhich is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote happened\nWhere does she go on this well she made the choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she can dome that behavioral letting we saw during the ... Kevin I'm proud and and that's why I'm Wondering what three effect would\nBe again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you try to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy but talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote prepare\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back to that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will do\nWith them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the boat and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll both with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior him not you know all of that that's you know that she evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion if Kavanaugh just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much a morose regardless of what our radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles been registered joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nPreserving Petro stopping centers almost half\nOf all drivers spend an hour or more looking for parking is easy to send hard earned dollars has time can fuse searching for that elusive spot in the stress a safe place to park or something you should have to worry about\nReserve it can help reservists lots of the truck smart for online service parking peace of mind in head first stop is not pay for parking with Belgium wanted to point to this is the ultimate reward\nTruckers quick question for you how do you say in a chain and when you're not on the road some truckers watch DVDs on laptops others just reading a book on their home some people even resorted trucks dub\nTV or your wife are no thank you\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of votes your drivers is now available for free as an F.

the radio ad that she started running in Missouri the Democrats and the Democrats calling other Democrats crazy Democrat mhm not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was going to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know felt after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] yeah I I think an oversight committee I get a guy that won't happen so [laughter] yeah I Will have to declassify it uh yeah well they now you know the the thing that I work at it\nAnd yeah thanks that's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with\nA ... it's a it is fascinating though because it it's something look isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter\nMhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today something apart is going to ask 'cause the was were the bombs\nLeiber not right where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package ... the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that instilled or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something ... ... worth of these devices ready to go off because they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening\nA package I think that's information that needs to be made a available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself if possible [noise]\nAh just we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the doubt as to ... I think was a four point four percent yesterday\nYeah yeah uh the uh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of them had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more companies come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the terrorists in retaliatory tariffs by trade partners as having an impact on on\nSo overnight is ... is is up and which I which you might expect mhm uh all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent\nIt's ah down one percent three the three percent right the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ... percent yeah a you're a mixture over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry with others in the housing market and we know for example about you know Ford coming down\nAnd and saying look thanks for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and there's something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and the ... of course the markets because one possible do you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor the suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that was happening\nOr as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and that's something that was you know was was brought up the yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody in their lap it could also be a foreign entity right\nYou know just to disrupt the American you know an electoral process or it could be just terrorists know who have decided to do it again which that's that's probably find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three day ...\nA bomb initially that nobody's state of whether these were active lied bombs that would have gone off right if ... if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by ... handling the package itself that we would she that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public\nBeyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for on a track here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the north east for the Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nFiguring out Missouri 'cause I don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri when you're inside of a ton of limited talent you know more but there there are or state you know more what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time\nBut it was interesting too so I understand\nUh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we've got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging\nAh not not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned it\nYou know white okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we had we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd set this when when the uh weight before that we sent this when the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned at the white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attractive to that anti terrorist message\nThat Trump has been so louder mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly you\nKnow you're you're you're you're really not you're ever on and work your way out of work right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going to go out and got the stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of people to go to the during the day when\nBest time to go or you know but but that's it if they didn't\n... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy\nDemocrat twice and by the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't uh I Can't think of his name uh didn't he ended up running for da\n... oh yeah yeah jak ran for Diego he was he became da da da da da da de ... is the fact that they they ... the wrong in their office all the time that we've always talked to wait longer and them on TV that I'm hearing about a minute [laughter] they drink all the time after every case what are those writer and they're drinking at the end of the day\nAnd they're often not wine by ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter] we thought and so when I heard that like come on a hey God they're they're prosecutors they all drank a [laughter] but but\nYet when we get getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term ex dream is Democrat yes for leadership of the Democrat right right\nAnd there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the in their internal were showing that this was the day you know this was a way a hot button\nOr that they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was used\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of call research response that you get\nThe because there's there's no other way to do there is no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so\nI think it's it's um\nClear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise what for McCaskill the problem in that is her her actions as specifically with with capital because in siding with her party in Kavanaugh\nYou were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be sure when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nAnd and and this kind of situation that is that it's going to end could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a ... if you looked at the September of polling ah you know as the CNN a McCaskill was up by by uh by three ... with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUntil a was nine twenty nine to tend to and it was a tie and then you know it through that whole time the cabin all thing and moves Missouri scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters and holy up one\nStill margin of error to point seven right uh and still nobody has said the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided there the using that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad\nBy the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mind set\nYeah you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet\nYeah because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of uh from fringe to extremists too I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy\nYou see Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means Mike he'll compromise with Republicans mhm\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is a this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's giving she's get of course they're they're Republicans in the state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle of this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other in terms for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses ... that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of\nWeakness if if it didn't help create well you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the the uh\nInsults the uh the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't it\nYeah but he's mentally ill and all that right you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack it's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that yeah but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats and twenty sixteen where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland as\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying well\nWe have compassion for everybody but if you think your if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you want man and it doesn't make that will manage shouldn't make you a man legally when you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman in the past majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct do what's\nRight and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill of put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person to stop you when the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and bad behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees\nClaire McCaskill's now as a

about tell us about the the life of the life of a you know what was from Eighteen eighty eight wow to Nineteen fifty two\nIt lasted a long time it was in bad shape for a long time also but a lot of good memories came out of their people really like the place and a lot of people still have this tells your feelings for that or\nDescribed it for us what was the dimensions what was what does it feel like being inside the venue uh there were some short porches on left and right am I correct\nYes there is about two hundred and sixty five feet down each line\nSo if you pull the ball at a good chance of getting extra bases or or run a ballpark was located where I forty three years now north down town and it extended from waters now seven street to street\nAnd I felt sided with chambers lower if it was ...\nAnd it was just it was entirely avoid some which was probably used lumber it was built for forty thousand dollars and thirty five so that was for the land so it gives you an idea what the structure look\nOh buck gotta repeat better during the cost was forty thousand\nBono a little cheaper than Miller Park man or didn't have all the amenities of\nCourse a very basic old ballpark it was a button or even when I was young um they tried several times to replace it but it just didn't work out politically and then\nWhen the idol or church widow owned it she kept it there and she had an ironclad leave and the brewers leave\nThen what I find interesting about the the history of the dismantling of the ballpark as it was sort of a gradual in because folks were still walking across the field than the latter days of life of of the ballpark when when baseball was no longer play there am I correct\nNo not really because ah they stop playing there at the end of the fifty to feed them and they started tearing it down just a few months later\nOkay okay I guess what I'm thinking of the time between the dismantling finished in the freeway system started there is a little bit of time

then they are in the late fifties interstates are being constructed there\nYou know my wife lady didn't live that far from the ballpark could you tell stories about walking across the field and it's a it's a love to hear or share that story\nYeah open place you know the game ended a people what were they wanted they didn't have to go to a particular X.\nMen really it was a multi use venue was a lot of stuff was going on and tell us about the variety of things from football the traveling shows the corps baseball\nWell the Packers play their ten times um sometimes as the home team sometimes as the visiting team there were other events more of our favorites for the Nineteen twenty two national ballooned race\nSo the balloons took off from inside the ballpark and the way the race for whoever went further to landing was the winner and the winner land is north of Quebec City\n[laughter] so it was\nQuite a race there were a lot of famous people perform there are including Paul wrote to the famous singer and actor or a quid football there for the Milwaukee team Nineteen twenty two\nUm bay districts and the Olympic athlete maybe the greatest woman athlete ever performed there she pitched one evening with a house of David team and after the nine and then game was finished very quick to more innings on a donkey\nSo she was a good sport of our oil or whatever all the famous baseball players were there Babe Ruth ALS Simmons um\nFor a gym for brother or put their play the entire baseball field and Nineteen sixteen as the Milwaukee Brewers which was after he won his medals and the Olympics

ego and we'll get to that we'll get to the interesting divorce situation after the news All right so here's our jumbled strain that we\nUh got a call from a big jumbo being alone greater greater four hundred and fifty two thousand one hundred dollars for it thank you David and so I got a call from my a lot of ... who works at a large bank because when you get into this area of jumbo loans you typically has to have\nBetter credit so a lot of money okay and so it's very common to have them for lenders to have a minimum credit score of seven hundred which is the case for the state and this particular ... currently had a credit score of six five nine six fifty nine\nSo he calls it can you handle give a jumble one program that can tolerate six fifty nine I'm like I don't know let it be known that we get calls from other mortgage bankers hey can you solve this thing I guess that's all that's right which you know [noise]\nSo so sure enough we did now now it would be a ugly rate five point eight seven five and a thirty year fixed rate Andy would have to pay us one point seven five points which on this jumbo loan is like\nEleven twelve twelve thousand dollars right [noise]\nUm but it's like salt like yeah I I don't have like three lenders ... banks lining up to offer you this money and my my first understanding is that he needed to borrow eighty percent that he would have twenty percent equity\nWell so that was like a couple of weeks ago so well maybe we can make an exception at this big bang finally get the call they can't make the exception\nPlease talk to this a customer so I talked to him and now it turns out so this is a shout out in a plea for help to any mortgage originator out there who might be able to help this person because it turns out he really needs to borrow eighty five percent\nOf the value of the homes were talking about along like seven hundred and twenty five thousand dollars seven twenty five\nAnd um [noise]\nThe ... the other thing and he thinks his credit score is going to go up because he just paid down a bunch of revolving debt\nSo so he thinks his credit scores going to go up so you think they're going to be like a construction yeah yeah he's fine is new construction so he's buying a house and it is for for the winter or for the ... and um so the other thing that he does not have the whole and this is very common in jumble lending is\nIn addition to have a really good credit score you have to have money left over after you buy the home and that's measured in the number of months of the monthly principal interest taxes and insurance\nSo I think I asked the reserves reserves so this guy's monthly principal interest taxes and insurance is going to be about five grand a month or so thirty thousand dollars for ... months he doesn't have\n... or maybe because it's an ... when it's a pile of money that big they want to make sure that because that was six months right so he doesn't have six months reserves but some of the money he does have is overseas so what we're looking for a year for this\nCustomer if anybody on any longer Virginia are out there\nAnd um yeah there you go so so the way to get rid of ... my is to work with a clever lender who knows what they're doing and has more than just the standard vanilla option yes okay All right you don't have to have twenty percent equity to avoid paying private\nMortgage insurance on a monthly basis okay so on and to use this a divorced woman and she's the divorce situation so you know divorces result typically an involuntary refinances and that's this is communist dirt and these people actually had refinanced is with us in the spring\nOr using a VA loans to pay off an existing first mortgage and home equity loan and consulted some other debts and then all the whole we've got divorced in the summer a and have these folks happen to live in Illinois where divorce is a lot faster process than in Wisconsin so we have a marital settlement agreement here\nBut the oddity is the way that this marital settlement agreement is drafted I'm it's typical in that it calls for the husband ex husband to retain the property and pave the ex wife half the equity in the home\nBut his condition upon he doesn't have to pay it according to the divorce decree until she moves out of the house\nWell and and the divorce decree goes on to allow

gonna be the bigger but it didn't happen my way we thought it would we we kind of had this\nFeeling we first got started we tried to have a raise money for a larger bird and we couldn't convince any bankers no matter how many uh ribbons and we won\nOne craft beer is more it seems more hearty like you had a couple and satisfying\nYes ... they are but um but yeah so it was the thing is you're always want to time's gone after like two or three percent of the population out there\nWith your peers and and and so making of beer that descent or somebody isn't really a negative thing and I always look at it like music or something ... you know a musician out there doesn't sit there and go I'm not gonna I'm gonna try to play some use it for everybody wants to try to play his music for himself that he likes\nShe likes and and then um and then you know you find your flowers and it's kind of the same thing and craft beer\nSo it's thought a lot of people are drinking hump can beer uh-huh I read that you were the second brewery in the U.S to make a pumpkin beer\nYes yeah we had people over some from the tracks called us up one time and said I heard about this pumpkin beyond California I Want you to make us one so we made a nice uh-huh and it's been a big hit and we've had a couple of different variations of it along the way and and it's been been fun\nSo ... secret to a really good pumpkin beer\nTo me the secret is as low hops and and ... it's a spice fear is that yes who you mean if you ever eat a I'm\nA any sort of Gore if like squash or something like that just below send them in their ... their meal of butter and but you never either without those those spices even have like pumpkin pie you're thinking of a sentimental Megan so that's where we put in the ...\nA beer and so you do put pumpkin but and uh but you want the spices to be the uh the start of the show you don't want to over ... ...\nAnd get a too bitter or anything of that sort so it's kind of a nice multi beer that reminds me more of a pumpkin pie than a a who have nice yeah that's what I Do is look at it nice to have around Thanksgiving yes thanks giving so yeah the season can definitely stretched so that\nDefinitely do you have a ... like I guess do you dream about beer do you think ... years while you're at home maybe watching TV do you think oh that would be a great flavor or maybe you're in the kitchen and you try something and how does that come to you or do you think of that stuff\nWe do think of how they're constantly we we um I mean is past six months of especially we've been trying we we'd meeting every Wednesday after I went to staff meeting and and coming up with different styles and types of beer that we're thinking about trying to uh to come out

it doesn't even have any so there's a couple\nOf things that I Want to mention you're a board member or a local first at the local first Milwaukee can you tell me a little bit about that\nSure it's it's an organization that helps promote local businesses in town so they have to be based in Milwaukee and owned by Milwaukee hands and and uh operate here\nAnd if you go to like a local restaurant in Milwaukee\nA when you spend money there I think it's about Seventy nine Seventy four cents of every dollar stays in the city\nIf you go to a chain restaurant forty nine cents of every dollar stays in the city and so one I always find going to a local restaurant or local bakery or coffee maker ...\nAnything on that sort you have a lot more variety and talk more fun than that you have a more innovative you cite is cookie cutter and and as compared to going to change change are good\nThey have their their nice you know they always have good quality but to me that's that's part of the heart and soul to see\nWhen you bring somebody in from out of town you don't sit there and go let's go\nYou know this this chain chain place you always try sitting there and saying what's this show you something you don't have in your town\nAnd so we're on to promote or local businesses and we have different events uh throughout the year and all we have food tried coming up and at our place how we also have a\nA that they have to agree or get a program for women for local first I'm coming up in in spring time but we're you know we've tried to get other people joining our our our cars and and trying to promote local\nAnother group that you're part of it as bells of Milwaukee uh-huh people may not heard of that\nNow we're starting to start this kind of a fledgling or or organization but we've had one big success for we took taking the bells of covering covenant spills on armed and and uh and restore them you actually can walk up to them and bring them yourself if you are there so I'm used to be a huge contract or a\nLittle down there they they know their big bell huge south are huge pills\nAnd then when they ran out and they're quite loud and you can reach up and you can grab the little ball inside of them in the end and entering them but they used to be a huge convent than in there that was started like Eighteen fifty five\nThey tore down around Nineteen sixty unfortunately um but the bells that kept an eye of the city or the Janelle ... uh they built this little ... that was out of 'em all the materials from what they tore down and the bells are there and they were kind of in bad shape\nBut that and so we restore them a and got those going but there's one thing about Milwaukee is that one nice thing is that there's so many churches in so many bells around and all these bills have fallen out of disrepair mhm and I like to try to get it so all the bells and town start bringing\nA you know on the hour or it's one thing other cities won't have and so I think that'd be a huge promotion or part of the identity of the town if\nWe could have that as you probably could would they be in unison I Would like to thank everybody amazing\nYeah I mean like every time at noon new to hear all the bells and the CERN around here you can kinda get it\nWhen you go downtown you there's a lot of 'em one side that rain right now um but to me the bells were also originally put in for sound science of peace\nUh and when you can't to the new year he always talked about ringing in the new year and people would go out and they don't bring their church bells um and for a for peace and for you know the\nProsperity of of the new year and and unfortunately right now sometimes you go on and you hear a bunch of gunshots\nAnd I like to get that would be a nice change right or health instead of ... and so I'd like to try to get to that point so we're trying to raise money and we got a couple of different projects are coming up\nOr or looking at that we can restore bells in different churches and and trying to get them to go so uh we can get those bells ringing again\nThat's a great concept I think people can definitely get behind ... and that's a couple of things that you're passionate about local first Milwaukee and outside Milwaukee yes uh let me ask you this\nMilwaukee yes um let me ask you this I tell them well I got to tell me an interesting fact about Ross that nobody knows [laughter] there's something deep inside that you always wanted people to know about or [laughter]\nI wasn't ready for that oh sorry\nThink a little bit and I imagine I or\nIs it one thing is I I Am I exercise in the morning around run a lot I don't have I'm\nDowntown no only well they've made it got out of the one\nThing it interesting I I probably can tell us I I I probably drink more beer before four o'clock and drink after year after four after for the drink during my lunch at one for lunch or we want to but we drink a testing during the day and I don't drink at home a lot but it's um it might sound out I guess is\nThat your it that's that's your day job a lot of people that you know maybe work in the industry probably do the same thing yeah I mean so\nJust everybody says well you must go on I'm an avid [laughter] and it's like well no\nYou you kind of you're tasting now and then you do enjoy it I'm a beer here and there but it's it's a I guess the one thing I have is that just because you want to breathe doesn't mean you have to drink beer that's a good point you can have it I mean you can taste that and and I remember when everybody comes into Murray always have a beer there yeah do you ever get tired of tasting beer no no [laughter]\nThat's got probably get silly question bang you know some people might I don't know but um\nThis has been

in the race and World War more point yeah I mean we're going coast to coast here next couple of weeks and then uh\nYou know going out out west or after the Miami game short weeks so it's going to put a strain on us but you know we'll just see what this guy's movies weaken accordingly these type of games do you want to be competitive team that land and genuine you got to win some of these games minutes is a three division winners you know on the road and\nStuff that's worse so you know this week and obviously a really hot damning ain't going against a common bill and those guys you know fantastic organization that I received a lot of championships in coming on ... on the road when was that was based on the way and in the NFL and then obviously you pick the vision rival game so it's a stretch\nAnd ask for the task at hand today's game at Los Angeles the rams are stacked led by defensive tackle Aaron Donald\nRight you've got to be aware of where is that I mean he was one of the more dominant players are they seeing a number of years\nI'm an independent that with the future hall of famer right next to him who can dominate the game as well and has since his first year plan so it's it's well coached on both sides of ball player the ants wave number of times these fantastical to announce he shined has done a great job but they're all parents so we got to find a way to slowing down a friend\nOf course Aaron Rodgers and Mike mccarthy like the past so much by the quarterback knows they need to establish the Ron\nIt'd be nice to have some more balance there and we want to really do but we ... a little bit faster and we did last week at times but we didn't have big time Laaleen canoe down to save our lives so if we're not in third down that we're limited number of a run opportunities so we've got to do a better job of a certain amount and we've got to run a more effectively and\nAnd you can write their downs gets more opportunity to run the ball down\nThe ... was about a couple of things number one getting ... number two getting healthy but also some self scouting some self reflection\nWe've had twenty two third and eleven pluses and I mean those are low percentage a conversion opportunities and we've had eleven I think Thirteen Fifteen plus this was even lower so you know the good job in\nThird and a one to ten when they were top tentatively want it then we're right near the bottom and eleven plus so we got to put ourselves in better situations on for a second down and then the red zone we go scores that sounds\nAnd because game respects game Rogers was asked about one of the NFL's young up and comers LA's Jared got\nI've got no jury a little bit over ... over the last couple of years and being a Caribbean island I'm Sam pulling for him and he's playing really well they um pretty law has played with the\nCheck amazing storyline of scrimmage it looks like and then there's a good job and I was an accurate passer is making good throws him and he's got some weapons to throw through but he's been extremely accurate and inefficient with the ball and that's where you need from a record of I\nAsk what what else the rams doing off that's the first half MVP of the season maybe running back caught early\nThat's where it starts you know when you can run the ball as effectively as the last couple of years because you know does open a lot of things up you know they do a good job of you know line and things up a formation workers have looks like a random paths and an avid actions off of that I was a scheme to Minnesota really well I'm with somebody that stuff but it starts with her and get rid of the rings game going and opens everything I was\nFinally Aaron Rogers was asked how exactly did the rams get to seven an hour to start the season\nYou know when when does it mean to you know and brought into some guys who are impact players you know we ran into\nA nominee consume them from getting down into camp and and paying and get him going bringing in the markets Peters bringing in Sammy ... you know they they added some pieces man is on the opposite side of the ball as well and your parents with the guys in the ... the running every time and time early they got a lot of don't\nRodgers this past week during his weekly availability at his locker that was cute the one also this week we had a chance to catch up with linebacker claim that use in our news of the week players coming home to play in the LA Coliseum for the first time since he started there in college at USC be quite honest I really thought much about it\nAre there in college at USC\nBe quite honest I really thought much about it I'm ... it'll be cool going back out there obviously be different than any uh uh you know posing locker room but um [noise]\nShould be fun though I'm looking forward to it for sure you know neck and obviously haven't played there are ... careers are definitely looking forward to it but um\nNo I haven't I've put too much thought into us one of the things that claim that use and the ... has\nTo do today try to stop ...\nIs a big explosive back you know obviously I'm now he's got a great vision he does it all real well you know they they use them in the passing game a together speed to get to the outside and obviously visions um between taco so I'm a you know he's he's a good thing but like that since uh a year one when we saw him or you know out here um\nWhenever that was a by you know he's just he's one of the guy who's you know probably probably the best back in the game right now and uh [noise] you know they're playing really well so um\nJust just a good player overall really yeah as for the rams do in their passion game specifically it starts with third year quarterback Jared gossip I think there's a great job in the\nPocket you know when he's a you know when he's comfortable I mean he sits back there if they see a little far apart is Pascal before and so I think we've got to get them on the spot and we'd probably say that\nAh you know every week coming to do but I think it's more important this week than any other it's just um I you know getting them off the spy getting them uncomfortable and I'm having him to throw in the run but obviously there are shutting down and got a a good old line timing is very well and obviously a great play color so um you know we got to work cut out for us but I'm\nFrom a good way to work as far and I'm you know coming back off the virus healthy as me then and and you know we like the opportunity so [noise] um answer your question you know try and get them on the spot and and make up there on the wrong [noise]\nThat is our news of the week\nComing up next to we will lead chicken with Tony ... and the WGM Jay breaking news center

for this team as a team that isn't to rebuild with an elite quarterback in the defense is awful Mitch rights as much as capers needed to go I think we're reaping the rewards of some pretty lackluster dress on defense yeah we have some decent players but as a whole\nThat he has his way to inconsistent and for guys such as petting and dominance primed to head guys they could play in these defenses and showed it he's still hoping images for two and three during this gauntlet as well\n[noise] uh dean writes unfortunately I only see the Packers winning two of these five games at home against Miami and then against Seattle or Tom rights to win three\nWhich would put the Packers record at five five and one at the end of the gauntlet or Tim writes two and three likely for this stretch\n[laughter] thankfully the bucks for making the fall bearable for Wisconsin's a sports fan since you're the birds just came within a game of the world series I Know that you wanted them to get to the world series but I think it was pretty palatable if you're a brewers fan by and large\nOr they were one game boy for the playoffs a year ago when we gave away from the world series or the season Patrick writes two and three during the gauntlet but Miami\nI beat Miami and um\nYeah I go to in three over the course of that stretch Mike rides three into hopefully Frank writes five into Joe right so in five okay\nSo we have certainly uh the gamut of a backer spans trying to figure out what their record over the next five games is going to be also put it out on Twitter and the boats have come in as well eighty percent say oh and fiber one in four fifty five\nPercent a vast majority thinks the Packers will two and three over this gauntlet Twenty one percent say three into only six percent for one\nOr five

Gurley\nWell at the forty niners that a lot of speed and I think it was deceptive speaking you don't really think of them as being a a very speedy team at least we didn't really anticipate that going into\nThe forty niners game and the ability to get to the edge and the chunk plays on the ground and so yeah you're talking about ... Gurley who is you know the the ultimate threat or because not only as a running back anytime he carries of all he can break up a big one but as a path catcher as well so\nUh ... obviously the rams are all about speed and Dave speed all over the field so if that was damaging against San Francisco think about how bad it could be against the French do I would counter by saying that the defense didn't start fat but they ended fast for San Francisco's last repossessions words three and out\nUm the lessons and of course was the interception and even the to feel good drives they had a thirty two and a third and for and the Packers were able to get off the field a big thing about the day is it's going to be you're going to take full advantage of every opportunity to the ranch give you\nSo getting off the field and third down they were able to do it in the last you know twenty minutes to the game that allowed the often to get back in and ultimately win the game but you can't wait till the fourth quarter the point that you have to play fast and you have to play well all four quarters today\nYeah exactly I Would humbly suggest that is one thing to rally against the bears or the forty niners right it's another to do that I have a little rams mark I wanted to ask you about the protection of Aaron Rodgers in that forty niners game San Francisco had three sex but also several her eastward ear and had to throw the ball away what did you see\nA you know I think part of it is Aaron obviously he likes to extend plate and hold the football but there were a couple that ... it just happened to quickly and\nGive San Francisco credit they adjusted to some of the play action stuff they kept their defensive ends or outside linebackers more vertical to force air and you know to get rid of the ball quicker or he took a couple of hits off of that\nI pass protection especially a tackle I feel pretty good watching David ... and ... playing a there's some things on the inside that there's some quick cats they're going to be tested today because when you have sue and\nYou have air and Donald this is as good at tests to these guys are going to have and I'm sure Mike mccarthy and his staff of looked at it and figure it out ways to try to help those guys as much as they can according\nTo Elias sports bureau is the first time the Packers ... three one hundred yard receivers in the same game since Nineteen eighty Jimmy Graham a democracy Adams and mark ...\nJeff what a night of redemption information ... you had that nightmare in Detroit well he bounce back for all four on field goals hit fifty one yard or in the game winner from twenty seven years and we\nWe all knew there wasn't going to be a a knee jerk reaction to the uh the decimated performance or in Detroit but it was going to be a matter of all I can can Mason get his groove back and I think part of it you know getting that field goal at the end of the Detroit game which seemed a little bit meaningless but I think just showing that looked a little bit of confidence\nGiving Crosby one chance to just kind of set his head a little bit\nUh it's good to know that again Cosby's at that place where you can really rely on him now again when you look at how today works out I don't know how much you want to see making Crosby unique touched down and not feel goals but um it it just goes back to\nThere's so much faith in Beijing Crosby they stuck with them through twenty twelve and there was no reason to not think that it was just a bad day maybe is worst day as a professional he would shake it off\nAnd

don't know how you do that there could be a couple of quote smaller trades if you will uh but I think that there's a good chance that I'm Ari Cooper and snacks Harris and are going to turn out to be

is one of the best pass Russia's in the NFL and he's an emotional leader of the defense and so you have to assume that this is a very good thing for the Minnesota Vikings that's sad this ... played pretty well and his absence got a couple of ... a Saxon [noise] we don't know yet\nAh may never know maybe it's none of our business exactly what's going on with Everson Griffin and we know that it had to deal with some emotional personal issues or they've had some time to get things calmed down and straight now he's an outstanding football player when he's right and he's on the field so\nI don't see how it can be a bad thing for the Vikings but I'm not sure that it makes a dramatic difference based on the way they played without um the defense has gotten better the last few weeks um this is a huge football game\n[noise] well I think it was a great fit because of all the health work but he did locally here at UCLA to get back into a position where he could compete again and it was a kind of a high reward low risk assigning by the rams this off season he has been really nicely I say some of his best work has come on special team taking care of the gunners\nUh I think he's essentially falling into a fourth cornerback role where to kill Robie Coleman will play in the slot and Troy hill I Believe we'll start again at the corner opposite markets Peters today or you write shields has been coming in and some\nA third downs situations but Troy ... played so well last week at San Francisco I wouldn't be surprised necessarily if he plays all three downs a but look there's

Packers dot com [noise] All right mark how would you assess injury and all\nThe play of Aaron Rodgers this season\nI think if you factor everything it I think he's played pretty well um you know little little more inconsistent we haven't seen the\nConsistency that we are accustomed to seeing from him and I think part of that is the first couple of weeks after that bears game he was incredibly limited with what he could do getting outside of the pocket but what he has done and what he has consistently doing\nIs closing up games and when he's been in position to win games whether it's a ... game or if you look at San Francisco\nHe continues to make plays but I'm sure if you asked him\nYou know he would say we have not been as consistent often he has missed some throws he has been a little bit with the lack of practice time he hasn't been asked sharp as I think we're accustomed to being but with your factor everything in I think you're still looking at you know a very good season up to this point from Eric\nNo question you have to factor in that knee injury but I think his play has not been up to the level that we're used to seeing I think he has been inconsistent and uh I don't think you need to look any further than to San Francisco game got off the fast start it's exactly what you're looking for the first quarter and then\nYou know kind of struggled to really get it together second and third quarter before\nAre really getting it together the fourth quarter and you know yeah we saw some some great the fourth quarter magic in Chicago a as well there have been times around Rogers\nLooks like that you don't unbeatable guy especially when when the game is on the line but there have been other times where he is missed open receivers and some of it's been dropped passes to 'em so it's not all on air Rogers but even with the knee injury which has been getting better and he does certainly have more mobility\nHe just simply hasn't played to that level that we're used to yeah I still\nThink Rogers has been pretty exceptional when you look at exactly what's been asked of him and what he's been playing through to get to this point as you guys said I'm sure there's throws out there who still wants back he wants more consistency in off and he said this week he doesn't want to be in third in long situations\nAs much as they've done but the fact remains the Packers are right now in this position that they're in with a winning record because of their and Rogers and what\nHe's put himself through to to get to this point\nI'm really interested to see what this look like today and what the leg looks like the brace having the extra week to come back from I just think with these conditions in having a history in this venue everything's sets up for him to be able to to get into a shootout if that was asked if um but\nThe fact the Packers are where they are and that that they often is right now for than the NFL or whatever it takes to get to that point late comebacks and all I'm Aaron Rodgers is is the guy that serves as drink for these guys and and once again you know they're they're in a chance here to potentially make another run at this thing because he's on the field\nI Would put it this way or has he been as good as he's been in some other years no understandably because of the injury but I'd also say he's the least of their problems and they have to use them in as west correctly points out where would they be\nWithout what writers has done All right mark should the Packers activate Jake ... or Trevor Davis off injured reserve\nA sure why not I think it eventually if you get to practice a couple of weeks if I think I understand the real correctly and then you can make a decision after that comes up but right now where is there a spot for him that's the question because you have\nAll these wide receivers you CJ mind more is not even active today\n... was somebody I think you heard all training camp you you love what he's doing he's brought to the table unfortunately for him some of these young guys have really stepped up and with the absence of Alice in in ... in the light of all of a sudden now there's a little bit more trust but from a kick return aspect of ... return\nI think Trevor Davis would be a great addition back on this roster if\nIt makes sense right now they're not getting a ton of out of it I think that's where if he's healthy and you you get these guys back and get him in a position where do you make that call whether or not they're going to help this roster\nBecause as we know everybody's healthy today that doesn't necessarily mean ... tomorrow or next week you have a little bit of time to kind of make that decision but I think you get them ready get a ... if the opportunities available both those guys to pounce on\nOf course ... it was fantastic in the pre season but you know limited snaps when it came to special teams and when you look at now you got the full complement of wide receivers on you know even when carbon Alison word how many targets that when I'm In St brown have less of a deal they have one and that was on the final drive of the game and\nA and B ... says you know made some nice catches and and I think he's taken advantage of its time but you just to stacked up but that wide receiver position so you need to do more than just the past catcher and this is where you've got value in Davis and we talked a lot about this\nAnd I was going to be some some some bumps on the road that you know we have to hash out first and establish and um you know sitting out in the running game is is the most important piece from the get go so um I think starting their um [noise] and letting things develop as we go and I think things will open up\nSo out of the Packers slow this off ants down Perry reveals one of the keys\nYou take away to run things they should slow down um pay their their great great Dane and one of the best running backs are over there and we just got to do a good job with but I didn't have a has a ball and a and making them you know I wanted to make sure\nThere's a lot of things they run in it and they keep it simple but [noise] um you know looks looks are the same uh you have to figure out the set this up ... and and all of those things\nThat running back very speaks Elvis Todd girlie was turned into one of the league's best off into threats Perry gives this scouting report\nHe can do it all I mean these these type of player to um you know you you gave him the ball and and he can make it happen um he makes everything go I'm so he he he he can do it all\nAnd we'll see we'll see what we get out there you'd he's grown he's matured um you know he has the right pieces in place um you know I think I think that the government or grow from and and the confidence and just being able to have a good team that could play behind I think all of those things come into play\nFor Perry this week takes on extra meaning as he returns to the LA Coliseum where he played college ball for us the from two thousand nine to twenty eleven now he's back but not so sure if he'll get a warm reception in sunny Southern California\nI don't know I don't know I don't know what to expect um you know [noise] you know ... it's\nIt's definitely exciting knowing you know it's kind of a homecoming for us because we haven't quite and you know we haven't been there um you know that's where our fans where you know I\nHad a good good a good period of time so I'm you know I'm hoping or it turns out good\nEthnic Perry the rams head coaches Sean McVeigh who's thirty to the NFL's youngest coach he was the NFL coach of the year last season\nWhen he orchestrated an incredible offensive Turner of the year before they were the league's worst scoring off ants and last year they were the best is the first time and league history a team had gone from last to first in that category\nA market we hear a lot about their eleven personnel on our fence one running back one tied in three wide receivers\nUh Mike petting the Packers defensive coordinator talked about how important it is for the actors defensive players to have I control in this game don't be sucked in by all the movement by the ramps a lot of play action pre stamped motion they try to create deception with looks\nAnd I'm Jared golf throws off play action more than any other quarterback in the NFL so the Packers defense has to stick with their assignments today right\nOh there's no doubt I think for all the people that you don't think that the running game helps the path of the game or that it's important I this is a great example because the Jared golf is a nice player but you get caught early out of that equation and all the wide open guys that you see in the big play\nPotential that you you know you when you end up seeing woods dirty she cooks down the field\nIt's because then I disciplined no defense according to come into every game saying\nWe're going to stop the run there is no doubt my patent has said we're going to look for a number thirty and we have to take we have to limit what he does because he makes the entire operation run not not only by running the football but by creating all the space sucking the line backers up putting pressure on that defense to slow that part of it down\nHe makes this thing go and that's a that's why this team has been ... I Hope that often just because he is not only great at running the football and and opening things up or is that again he's great catch in the ...\nThe great at running the football and and opening things up for his other guy he's great catch in the bottom ... he's a matchup nightmare and for this ... to really be productive today they have to be really dialed in to what they're trying what are the odds of St Louis what Los Angeles is\nA is try to get done limiting what they can do with pat girlie\nPackers de France comes in twenty seconds against the run the season Geoff what's going

and uh\nYou know mark you have a great way of sifting through what's real and what isn't so I'm going to ask you when you look at this ramp steam and all the seven to know hyper whatever what their what's their vulnerability what's their soft underbelly\n\nI to me it's there are secondary and I I Know when we had their play by play guy talk I think that's what he mentioned there's injuries obviously whenever you Lee lose a guy like I keep to lead in that back in their past\nRussia masks a lot of those issues but I think that's part of this team that because you you look at their special teams and it's been dynamite\nOffensively they have been really good ... you know putting up a bunch of points but they have been vulnerable and if you look at what Minnesota was able to do out at that stadium they were able to move the football and have big place so\nThe big play a problem that Green Bay has its ... it's not just that I think\nThe Los Angeles ramps have that as well and I think you can get after that secondary and some of those underneath routes you're playing with those linebackers I think that a week instead of steam and that's why I think you're going to see a lot of points put up this afternoon\nRams are trying to become the first California team to win the super bowl since the Nineteen Ninety four forty niners and speaking of the forty niners Jeff in that\nWind that the rams had last week in San Francisco there longest touchdown drive with sixty hours that's somewhat deceiving because the forty niners kept giving them turnovers and and good field position but the rams had a seasonal oh three hundred and thirty one yards of off ants in that game and Todd girlie was held\nI'm I'm using ... to sixty three hours but he did have three touchdown\nYeah and what's interesting you know the rams can do so many things and I often times you know they they started driving the twenty or the twenty five yard line into place later admitted field on the wind that they had against Minnesota earlier this year in the first half\nThey had three touchdown drives a seven yards are more and all those three drive they ran into place three place in fourth place so there was no question that the the explosive Mrs there without rams often that being said\nA and you're right it said it's I mean they're not infallible they will make mistakes Jared Gulf will throw interceptions\nAh ever since they lost to keep to leave that secondary has been vulnerable to giving up explosive places around they gave a thirty one points to Minnesota they get thirty one points to Seattle so could we see a shootout today I mean that is most certainly a possibility and also with Cooper come out and I know that went through this with San Francisco as well\nBut it does take away a little bit of what the rams want to do you mentioned that eleven personnel that they want they knew that almost exclusively I mean whether it's goal line or you know form at an officer short yard at situations they want to keep the same personnel out on the field but within that\nBetter option we continue our conversation with Tom silver started Milwaukee Journal
