I'm trying to write about how the brewers should use their pitching staff to attack the Dodgers lined up and it's just making me want to series this aren't right now so what are you seeing out of this mess up then I think all of us looking at it I don't or we're going to find those entertaining one way or the other is going to be entertaining\nYeah it's going to be fantastic and I can tell that because no matter what I say about the series I'll get replies from both fan base and saying\nI'm not respecting their team and on which\nTells you these are two really good team you know obviously are there different teams the Dodgers are now the sixth time defending division champion and the birds are just two years off of losing the you know Ninety plus games so they've gotten here in different ways and obviously the pictures that are very different\nFor all kinds of fantastic and the Dodgers rotation very good um but I'm I'm really just I'm interested in the chess game here the strategy this is going to be so cool I hardly need to tell you about the the depth numbers bullpen but if you look at the Dodgers their lineup is so deep and they've got so many options if you look at first base when you look at left field you look at right field\nThey've Roberts has different guy can use against ... and so it's really fascinating to me when Craig council is going to pick his pictures here or what sort of Dodger lineup he wants to face and it's going to be motivated to make a change quickly with additional help get her to try to force reference to his ... that's really what's going on was fascinating to me\nMy God was looking at this to try and figure out who was hot and who's not coming out of the LDS and I was surprised to find that ... was Oprah Lebanon the LDS Mardi Gras no one for Thirteen many McDonald's three for Seventeen max Muncie to for eleven met him once the war\nThere are more guys who aren't hot than are coming into this and so yes but then I lost a little further eat home runs against the Braves in twenty seven walks so it was kind of the ... the walk were boots and then blast and then they found themselves on the winning end of a ballgame\nYeah I'm Glad you you pointed that out because the Dodgers had only two times and now the U.S which is not an impressive number but as you mentioned blow out of power and a lot of skills and you know that's really the game they're\nIn especially in the postseason where the equality of pitching really goes up by so much it's really hard to string together three four five his or her out for a rally and I think that's part of why you see a you know home runs tend to increase a little bit in the postseason because teams are realizing that that's not the way they're going to score is a stain rally so they need to try and get the ball park\nSo if it's interesting we in that sense not as far as who's hot and now I don't tend to look at that too much based on just you know three games I mean you could look at it in the air to looking back they really do much and looking back I was going to be the envy pay\n'em and so I don't work at it too much just in the center or what happened over the last few days I still think the guys who are talented um are going to be able to show that talent and when I looked at both lined up\nI don't see like a massive edge for one side or over the other I mean obviously Christian ... which is probably the best player on both sides\nAre but then you've got the depth of the ... the voting having their infield and uh it's gonna be a lot of fun to have these tensions are just\nYou know both teams might go see a lot of strike out a lot of walks right I mean this baseball a lot of home runs emitted as short sequence scoring and get to see and really the beginning of the playoffs for both leagues it's it's kind of been there a microcosm of how baseball was printing these days\nYeah actually looked at this this morning kind of comparing what we saw in the regular season to what we've seen so far the post season\nAnd uh a couple of things that were in the regular season starting pitchers faced about sixty percent of batteries and so far in the post season it's been almost exactly fifty fifty split so we've already seen it dropped by ten points unsurprisingly that also means that fastball philosophy has really increased by about a mile and a half in the postseason\nMore fast ball I think it's more strike out and you know you're obviously not a thing that team number five or six starter you're only and the cream of the crop\nUh so it really is a different branch of baseball and that's almost by necessity with the extra up is the fact that you only have the best teams and it's sort of a you know takes everything that happens in baseball during the six months of the season that just turned it up to eleven it's like the most baseball you can get\nWe'd like honesty on this program I we also have a good Homer well what's your last year and how things are going to play out\nWhile I went I went to address and seven and a no disrespect intended to Milwaukee because obviously if I'm saying it's going to go seven games that I really do think either team could win and a part of the reason I went with the Dodgers is just because I Do really this is going to sound very traditional I write the rotation of law I really like not just ...\nBut I think ... the best picture people don't know yet and I'm sure you have an unbelievable and that sort of one thing I think might be a weakness for the first\nThree of the four doctors starters are left to you and if you look at the ... he'll\nTry to shy and only two of his thirty two home runs against like he's like the stock is his worst against ... and Jonathan scope who is supposed to be there to be the right hand to complement haven't hit at all this year so I Do wonder if that might be a bit of an edge but really I I think doctors and\nSeven because it had to pick somebody\nI think this is going to be incredibly even match up I can take on an IPO boy\nI Do too and you know the the Dodgers ability to take walks you asked me wondering how long a starter or news a lot of people can go for the brewers I Do look at the Dodgers and you mentioned\nA lot of people can go for the brewers I Do look at the Dodgers and you mentioned where you you mentioned ... no surprise a vigorous seven or eight years I think that is a surprise and the brewers world is just not how they played all season\nNo not really not and that's not even the plant um yeah I should mention in your shall we don't actually know what they're going to do with their pictures and I think we all have to\nUh that you wish you the will be the uh the opening of the soccer and came on and I think he's actually a little underrated I looked at a starter against right and the right handed batters and he's like Popeye this year and last name is like a like a grown man or a lender ensure that is actually pretty under it and\nUh it it would be a big deal we know they're going to be a ball game somewhere I don't know where it's going to be my guest it may be going to because you got to travel they afterwards and you can rest earlier um but there's really not a small part of me that would love to see the birds get the world series and ... and the first in the world there is just to

for the call that crap first grade I'll\nRead it gets pretty basic of her life guys are you are listening\nHere I mean here's here's us I mean here's Wisconsin Milwaukee brewer's we our family we address our our ... grade we we\nOver the house we don't care about what a rare for me on people's radar what grade and my my favorite time for brewers back at a December ... when they sat director for the last one vote or oh I was a one on a whim perhaps came on fire life\nBrewers and the rangers right that was a twelve ...\nTwelve Raleigh a sleigh rent the raw beer swam at home mom I was All right if you're on the runway and follow\nUs there you go to our stream college there are some place\nThat was a ... a very warm Easter Sunday in April if I remember right and uh yes Jim ... home run raw dear to run over by the time maybe as a free run shot that scored going brags and somebody else\nMy dating myself fashion but that was a magical time several was a ... year but it wasn't the play off year but really felt like it should be though it really felt like it should be it was a magical start to the year nothing like it really in brewers history\nUntil maybe now I I don't know I they've never one Thirteen number oh since the rental living right now and they're doing some of that work in the playoffs that's pretty special stuff maybe that's why it feels a little different they're rolling going into the playoffs and have continued their role in the playoffs\nEven in two thousand eleven they won the first two games against Arizona then they went to Phoenix and got crushed came back for an incredible game five and extended the season against the cardinals why is it different for you\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty we've got Jerry Springer joining us next to Jerry\nHey Hey Greg I'm for me twenty of loving uh the expectation was that was going to be awesome you know ran a key was brought in his manager at Braun and and we're always felt like field there was on last year kind of thing drank\nHe helped me out who was the other the trade acquisition Toronto\nTheir son Mark I'm ... and Jack like\nThere's a lot of gas\nYeah he did he did but at the beginning of the season there was an expectation that with all these people coming in and and that included grandkids manager there wasn't an expectation that rate things were going to happen\nAnd at the beginning of this year I admit I was one of the people I wasn't entirely sold on came and yellowish right away\nAnd how many of us it's taken a lot of cheese and to get used uh the the bullpen and strength of the vote and things and how that's carried a ... game winning streak uh that's that's just my observation\nJury so you you followed the brewers for a number of years it sounds like right sure sure so if it did it take you a while to adopt the style of baseball that you're seeing because it is so different than what we saw even six seven years ago\nA took yes it took awhile for me to\nNot quickly criticized council sure some of the city to make a you know the white what's happening to our starting pitching kind of thing a emails and stuff like that stuff like that I've had questions about the hitting\nA you know some of our our decisions about when to be aggressive showing at the first pitch versus you know don't showing at first to pitch is\nBut if I give him credit he's he's holed up together\nAnd all that stuff is part of an eleven game winning streak like you said and in part of that love and the whole sheet and Scott H\nI mean I'm I'm kind of like you or it it can't get any sweeter than\nClenching a playoff berth in St Louis or you know clenching the division in Chicago and a lynching the division the matter is the first round in Colorado I'm\nYou know so now now we got to get the team the no I don't think for from the Dodgers that means they're going to mention in LA I suppose\nWell that's fine they start to have to agree to write whatever it takes to get the victories in and move on this team is on a roll to write so I never really in the playoffs yeah just brewers team ban on an absolute role going into the playoffs it got a note from Chuck it attacks on say how many years at the brewery slumped after the all star break in really never recovered\nYou know that was part of the demise of Ron ... they just got to be slumps of boy just there was a mess\nGo back to Ned Yost he was fired was a you know less than a dozen games to go in the regular season\nThey they just couldn't get when they were tights there were uptight and then insert deal swaying before a playoff series to you two weeks out of it I mean that was a bizarre situation in two thousand and they are so very different times but you're right you know sometimes that post all star game slump just couldn't get out of it\nThe brewers absorb it this year they really did a couple more phone calls on the other side also I we had a tech come in last night and this might be the key reason why it feels different and twenty eleven in twenty overweight versus now for all the right reasons will go through it after this double duty I'm Jay\n\n\nHe lives [noise]\n[noise]

apprehension that's why you are their first concern during any dental procedure whether you're there\nFor a simple cleaning an exam or something as complex as a root canal or if you need implants you can rest easy knowing the doctor Michaels in his great staff will make you as comfortable as you can be\nAnd all kinds of Milwaukee dental care affordable quality dentistry is no longer a dream it's the reality\nDr Michael stand in healthy within no interesting plan ... dental care and Dr Michael ... is the dentist for anyone who's ever been afraid of dentistry you like me now it's time to go to the dentist so don't wait go to Mike guy Dr James Michaels at a carnival walked into camp\nCalled the friendly caring staff that kind of want dental care today and make an appointment before the snow lies\nWe were with another\n\nOne of our callers brought up about you know two thousand and eighty thousand eleven ...\nFriends some of these were big times does didn't kick in repeaters the playoff teams but in two thousand and eight I mean that was it for some after you knew he wasn't going to be back in shortly thereafter Prince Fielder or run and run who's going to be the brewers to run the made an offer to feel that for a hundred million or more\nYou knew he wasn't going to come back and he didn't they ended up ... son Mark I'm was just kind of done so there was a feeling of two thousand and eight and there was a feeling of two thousand eleven\nThat maybe you were at the end of something instead of at the beginning of something and I think that shapes your mind is a fan right now this is amazing this incredible stuff\nBut it also feels like you're at the beginning of something you would just brewers team and that's because Lorenzo pain is still under contract for several more years in sewers Christian yellow\n... there's no real fear of losing a core player you might lose my Christakis that's fine I think you can absorb that you're you could probably find another

Parker first was only on line and now has physical stores\nBut not a lot of those either but for people who want to go see frames and get a sense in person they can go do that and so this idea just like Harry's the the razors\nOriginally only on line now you'll see displays and I think target stores of Harry's\nAnd doesn't take a lot of market share to disrupt the way and industry works the Gillette has been absolutely beaten into a pope\nAnd the market place by the online sellers particularly dollar shave club\nWho has affected them so much even though the online sellers now account for only a little more than ten percent of the razor market the mattress market somewhere ten to Fifteen Percent and sector after sector\nPeople who come up with the simple fact way to sell\nAnd one that is ultra user friendly and convenient and makes it simple for you to returning item if you don't like it no games no gimmicks they're gonna take market share because they've made it easy\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show well Hello John how you doing\nGood Mr ... please call me Clark okay claw hell he used a wonderful thank you hope you are I'm doing wonderful thank you for taking my call sure\nSo I have a quick question probably not a simple answer the question still know that when you have a bank account you have FDIC insurance and credit unions have their own insurance\nBut in the low cost um investors terms I Everytime I call and ask I'd get the well we're not going to go bankrupt\n[laughter] that's no answer is it\nNo it's not so look at the Chechen Israel\nOkay so it depends on what you're actually doing like if you own of a series of funds bike you own mutual funds are index funds the value of what you have is controlled by the holdings inside that fine\nSo the value when you invest goes up and down the find itself is not at risk and less the investments in it [noise]\nGo to zero so let's say you buy 'em an index fund\nFrom one of the big discounters from vanguard fidelity Schwab someone like that who you know those three are taking so much market share or you end up owning a ATF from one of the you know one of the black rocky ts those are the the big discounters and the market\nThe money that is in a fund\nIs secure in that find there's never been a situation where a money has been stolen and it's just a well and the money's gone\nAnd money in a a brokerage does not have as you mentioned FDIC insurance or anything like that the holdings are protected by what's called S. I. P. C. did anybody mentioned s IPC to you\nA shame that at the bottom of the page when you're looking at the site\nAnd S. I. P. C. is a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have added a credit union through in the u._s._a. or at a bank through FDIC\nSo as a PC is a privatized version of protection and the most contentious cases of involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd s IPC has not been there to protect people in the event of a brokerage going\nOr to protect people in the event of a brokerage going insolvent CSI PC takes care of people but if it's involved fraud or something like that they don't put your money how is it held is it in mutual funds or a ...\n... mostly most of it as a mutual funds indexes in an IRA I'm a little bit of it is in money market now with money market be different than the ...\nYes so money market works a little differently and last decade during the ah banking scandals there were I think to money market funds they couldn't pay out\nPeople's accounts and they went at least temporarily insolvent and it was a terrible problem very upsetting to people and\nA money market situation but brokerage houses offered generally two options you can either have the money and uh pitiful you earning FDIC insured\nA account or you can have it in a money market account where the interest changes each day\nAnd I have my money\nAnd money market I'm not particularly worried because even last decade when we had this this series a banking scandals\nNo one of any and there was no significant or meaningful loss for anybody from any of the money market even the ones that temporarily went insolvent ultimately paid people the money they owed them almost a hundred percent\nWonderful thank you very much for answered the question\nThe big risk always is with a smaller brokerage that may be crooked and that's when your money is at greatest risk if that gives you any comfort\nBut does thank you very much right best to you ... thank you Bye bye\nRobert's with us on the Clark Howard show and Robert you're witnessing can did talk about your car via experience yet another disruptor I was talking just moments ago about the mattresses and razors and who knows how many other businesses are going to be disrupted carbonara\nYou buy a car sight unseen for you call me because you were trying to do what with ...

winter [noise]\nYeah that's pretty cruel and me in October to talk about winter but I got to 'cause I got to talk about your wallet\nThere's new data that shows that the amount of natural gas which were used for roughly sixty percent of our energy in the United states\nThat number may be off a little somewhere more or less sixty percent now\nNatural gas is in shorter supply than it's been in recent years as we head towards colder weather months and one of the ironies of natural gas is it's now used for things way beyond just providing heat\nBecause more and more power companies around the country use natural gas as their main source to produce electricity so natural gas has gone from being a smaller market\nServing heating needs for people and in certain households providing a natural gas cook tops there's a lot of people prefer cooking with gas rather than electricity\nAnd that we're to say but yes even though natural gas is used for boat that's the big change so the overall market demand for natural gas is much larger the current supply a little smaller\nAnd so what does that mean and the market it means that we have a decent chance see higher prices on natural gas\nAnd remember you've got hit on both sides of the equation even if you don't use natural gas at your home you're still affected almost certainly on the electricity side\nSo no one can know what's gonna happen with wintertime temperatures are we going to see a cold winter are not going to be another mild winter we don't know that\nOkay\nI'd start in there and if you find out you've already ceiling

Fifteen million\nActive credit card and debit card numbers even though the ring as a there's some members of the ring that have been arrested it doesn't mean that the numbers are safe\nAnd there are

your own bags are containers or whatever and you scoop up what you're buying\nAnd do your own items and and your own a packaging and you take those items home so it's for people that are very much into the simplicity movement the reduction of waste\nAnd the idea isn't buying things basically you're buying a boat products instead of individually package putting them in your own packaging\nThat

for taking my call\nCertainly Dave you've got a gripe about Amazon [noise]\nI certainly do [noise] I'm In a ... for a long time [noise] I'm always enjoyed the service however lately it seems like I'm not getting two days or a shipping\nA change like I'm getting four five six day shipping a I\nOrder some for my garage door my batteries went bad I ordered some replacement batteries a on a Wednesday morning at eight am [noise]\nThe uh noticed I got the shipping noticing it was saying today the following week\nAnd I called and said hey what's going on all will expedite it overnight for you\nKnow ... chart [laughter] and they came on Monday [laughter] well\nThey Amazon is training and they are doing every experiment they can come up with to try to get their deliveries back to being reliable\nBut there's a there's been a deterioration that any\nAmazon Prime loyalist would see exactly what you are saying and his experienced it themselves\nFit the delivery frames are not meeting the two day promise anymore in fact the Amazon now says the two days means from when they've actually fulfill the order is not two days when when you order now\nYes and I guess the worst one was on the black Monday I really wanted a fifty inch TV for the three hundred dollars\nFor it [noise] and unfortunately we were going on vacation on friday of that we [noise] we were leaving five AM in the morning [noise] border the TV on Monday and got the notice that it was shipping on what's going to live on friday\nAnd I called and I said this won't work [noise]\nAnd they said well ... and they gave you me exactly the shoes they gave me was\nThe TV had to be repackaged and pulled off the shelf in the warehouse and shipped [noise] and I said well that won't work there will not be anybody here on friday and they said well sorry there's nothing we can do you just have to cancel\nShow I did I immediately sent an email canceling the order and about two hours later I got an email saying we can't cancel your order\nThat okay let me explain that how that could happen so that's been a really confusing thing for people Amazon as I understand it from what I've read is doing a lot of what's known as direct ship\nFrom ah manufacturers are from wholesalers where it's never passing through an Amazon warehouse is shifting from a manufacturer or distributors warehouse and once they put in that order\nThat's how it's being routed to you with a third party delivery service so or Amazon Prime you remember [noise] cause it's like a victim of its own popularity and success is not the Amazon Prime of any more\nI understand but the problem was I didn't want to fifty inch TV sitting on my front I learned my pirate run off with it exactly\nRight so let me let me cut to the chase on this with Amazon\nTo day delivery no longer means two days takes up five whatever calendar Amazon uses however if you do get some of the incomes late and you call Amazon the most common thing they'll do for you is extend your prime an additional month for free [noise]\nSo\nYou get something for it but if you're hoping that Amazon in the near future is going to go back to being reliable worshipping forget it\n[noise] ah [laughter]\nI think about it they've got how many members they have now they keep raising the cost of prime and it doesn't seem to make any debt and the popularity of it and the number of people want to sign up [noise]\nI understand but it sure doesn't help me when I Need the items and quite frankly I convenient stores\nOkay so I Would suggest experimental it'll try ... dot com

boxed meal X E D dot com seems to be putting a smile on a lot of people's faces and there are there are alternatives even if you are not an area convenient stores\nThere are these smaller competitors

brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tank and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor time or comments made by the Taj a regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace of which they move\nWhile you can even think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and a stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a sudden it or not moving very quickly what like Florence and there were certain linger over the place and that given period of time whereas\nA leaf in the past who can stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a fast you're moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Florence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um\nA window over a a area for a longer period of time and that has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall um but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's a land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nNo no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants Sarah continue to move across the Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Brian ... tang of this\nDepartment and would you would teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people do they I think uh they live at all these terms like a old lace we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of us\nKnow what that is but it sounds like you folks were are totally on touch a with the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time I we used to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess it had no idea why today\nWe act like you guys do everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and did it strikes me that there's a happy ballads there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beast that weather prediction will always be uncertain too to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come a very very long way and ability to predict whether to predict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\nWhat is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nA while and and the Atlantic um we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form a in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction of them will form into tropical depression is usually in August September and October\nBy that time of year I Know there is a season but they're going to be a wide\n... that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that's also when the uh the atmosphere as as a a ... the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to for\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who worked with a while at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him and says there anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers at camp crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nIs that you you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago the ... it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nBy yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast them out on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get ... a a more powerful and um we we sort of learn about the Amish are more and more um we definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at ... at the tropical psych load formation of this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the uh but now the other part of your research intensification okay for the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical aside from prediction that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly song Michael we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nOr ... or a hurricane um so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feels tropical cycle is that at that as as you as you said before the warm ocean waters\nThat a light below the ... are both below the hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for the power to when is it a storm [noise]\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the the the climate system itself ... uh are there are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm due to hurricanes ah portions of the planet where a a all else being equal or it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nYes there the Lansing actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific\nI'm off the coast of China and Japan and the Philippines\nGet many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons but you know the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that is another thing that I think ... uses a lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons it'd be in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and in the western Pacific and fight phones yeah just sort of generic cycling as the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we're our centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes ... which is why I and the science community we just referred to everything out the tropical cycling instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nUp All right we'll continue our discussion tonight of your calls welcome of course uh either as a question for our guest a surgery but he talks about the weather uh and uh also any experiences you may have a particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well\nAt one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six our guest\nDr Bryan tang an assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\nYeah the satisfied I think it I think that these are things you just you know if you have one that's intense coming at you kind of just have to get out a way\nWe have a call from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama all the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening da da\nDi di ... and ... and I was like a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane knob and there's not much rhetoric that we're giving to hurricane Camille all having seen the nine right that was five and nothing\nHas ever been worse uh I think a lot of each other storm hit and getting a wrong in comparison to get Camille I mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf uh there were\nTankers ever African traders bar just on a highway Ninety and I think that in that area\nAnd they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know ... or ... or anything I just wondering if you could comment on the fact that um that's given no reference for the area of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nOr you're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot lot of people these days I don't remember a that's starting to get that did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right that the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast or or was absolutely tremendous um\n[noise] what's what's different today perhaps is that uh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because of the building on the coasts as a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's a choice to do that you know\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that ... I went through the entire bank uh-huh I went through all that so I mean I'm\nA ... got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that came with a little not too ... ...\nOr ... yeah you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tend to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you\nPrepare and emergency kit and and it's it's a ... like this where where um you know it comes to ...\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of ... and uh it almost eight my car or is it the war way at the side of the of the some land by a a a stream bed they became a raging torrent at a uh literally had I if I had not gone to the the lot where this car was\nAnd moved out of my car I could not get into the car the driver's side but I I moved to\nA away

ocean blew\nA uh it it did certainly put that the data in my head and if you couple that with a few other facts I guess it's an important thing to know but but you're right there was a lot of rote memorization yes\nThat's entirely true in the primary way in which we teach students here treat\nTheir true and most were text books are written in the way most estate exams are most state exams cared for and it's kind of knowledge students might have for the past\nBut it's real hard to think of it interesting duty for the industrial revolution matches and holding down in the ocean below show that um\nTo ... really the only game that kind of understanding and it's a real issue in February we're going to we being the foundation of going to recruit new way to teach American history based on providing\nStudents are more interact here are deeper problem days more understanding of the field more story California blessed ratification\nWell that was certainly seemed to be aboard that perhaps greater context I must admit that I've always been something of a history nerd and I find this sort of thing a compelling the the various issues interacted the personalities who ah who interacted\nAnd how has it would have changed by a difference in the identity of the certain key people at a certain time uh for example had the Abraham Lincoln not been elected president in Eighteen sixty or our history would have been dramatically changed in all likelihood so\nAre these are important things that it doesn't strike me that it's impossible to to teach this way is it\nIs and they're already programs around the country that are doing this a ... game for the last three years the foundation in teaching history teachers in schools\nHow to teach using game had only ... game but more importantly let's go back to your Lincoln example so Lincoln arrives in Washington\nHave had to sneak into Washington to avoid the assassination attempts he arrives at the White House\nAnd we tend to think of all of history as negative all\nWe can think of the people who had those jobs relaxing figures adult from prehistoric gun Lincoln arrives he's a flesh and blood man who comes from the mid

hour on a on that are now down to a tropical storm last\nUpdate was that one I Am a uh the uh sixty mile an hour consistent wind speed\nIs what we had at that particular a point but it's still a well defined tropical storm over Georgia entering the south Carolina will through the day go move up through North Carolina and parts of southeastern Virginia before it heads off\nA in the Atlantic but ah as a Tom and both the John ... told us a earlier a ... and and they predicted it this was a storm that was going to stay together wasn't going to disperse and it looks like as we talk to Tom last hour he said all the way to Ireland\nUh yeah it's going to it's going to remain a that there's enough heat even in\nThe uh uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic and there's still enough heat to keep that together all the way across\nThe big pond which by the way it'll it'll reach near Ireland and Great Britain Sunday yeah about that's a fast moving storm you know\nWe'll have the latest update coming up here in a little bit the other big story a stock market down eight hundred and almost eight hundred and thirty two points uh yesterday looking at ... uh the stocks are overnight everybody's getting taking a big hit\nA from a from Asia throughout Europe and also it looks like a that ah the opening\nLooking at the Dow futures right now will be down you know maybe a couple of hundred points to start to start the morning we'll start that will start down\nA variety of different things uh it was interesting because I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by its\nUs reading the wall Street Journal is said investors really weren't surprised by this done thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category but just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happen to be talking about that last night\n[noise] [noise] right and and we were looking at that\nLast night right and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year\nThen you you put those together with the housing sector at the at the toward the end of of or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates\nSo you had these these loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected\nWell when you have delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners\nIt was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than it than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim primary at CNBC industry dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because\nTo his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about a long term effect\nUh you know you have the gene saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and freight well or that\nBut that that's an intermission from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they are as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should\nRight because if you are saying that you're raising interest rates um\nAnd it is regimented and\nAnd really has a you know a ... ... if your point is a ... ... ... ... that they should wait you know Jim ... is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well you\nAre admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity\nIs is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be might ...\nRegulation and taxes because that's what a tariff it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if you're if you're raising the cost of doing business is always going to her well and\nAnd that will see the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this is long lived if they if they're going to be a long lived if\nIf they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorism and and the tears even in the situation with China because it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.S\nA than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh

I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and we're correcting generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about uh uh this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a thirty day run this thing travel nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nAffect the Hawaii but then kept going and but uh roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay I got an right\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regain power is considered extra tropical but it's ... you're right in in nailing it here\nThe it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making a good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWhile it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling for those professional drivers out there\nAnd the high profile trucks I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know what their season driver they know\nThat those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael ... the kind of ... I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that as a main quarter of course between of Florida and New York\nAnd then we'll go to some ... some degree they're going to have this stuff that they're back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five or twenty uh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham right Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ... I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington that that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all\nOf those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nAh it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states\nWhile a and it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Miller bars um just beyond that\nPosition number four in the record book\nHappens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five and the record book but what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday\nAbout continuing to grow as it moved its weight and sure mhm atmosphere was perfect not in the last hour it dropped from nine twenty two to\nNine Nineteen it was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that\nThat I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty and and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning show [laughter]\nSorry by her up [laughter]\nHundred and fifty yeah why\nAnd then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah now the ten I'm as central air force base frightened Kendall as a radar\nAnd that radar was quick read\nAs it was coming ashore at um I Believe it was clear he'd at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed wind speed there are a hundred and Seventy seven miles now now now that doesn't translate to the surface but it obviously um\nThere were probably that were easily go over a hundred and thirty miles an hour in this particular storm that made it down to the surface but that's just to give me an idea how powerful this thing is and again\nI have to thank all the people who were went out there and report it and covered this I'm\n... and and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time you know you may have noticed everybody in the weather channel there was out there had been had their hand held Anna monitors this time yesterday yeah right yeah they didn't want to have anybody walking behind them with a grocery cart\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah I could kind of ruined the drama if you will you know and and that's you know if you look\nYeah and and that's you know if you look at this ... a storm\nEight carried on it carried all of its drama Michael came with his own drama or it was there was plenty of it you didn't have to go [noise] make anything of it it was a storm that joke for itself and its intensity are coming up or we will ah ah the we will\nWhat will let you go back and get a nap after we talk to your bottom of the next hour Tom and and

I heard on the news this morning we're hearing WINZ loving miles of wall had been constructed and uh but that was part of a [noise]\nIn the making attempt to give I think give us border\nSecurity that we haven't had an a long time and and there's a lot of work to do and then that's just a very small part of it [noise] it involves not just the physical barrier but technology\nAre a number of people added to the mix of ah enforcement agents\nLawmakers who want to actually do something about the er the border security and immigration I thought it was interesting I'm Kevin McCarthy dinner interview

the wall in December and watching what they said it was able to do with Kavanaugh\nI Believe this gives them the opportunity and the time to get this done once and for all\nThat's congressman Kevin McCarthy he's the majority leader and actually as a or could be the next speaker of the house or after Paul Ryan departs in January so\nThat idea to introduce legislation\nAfter the election they'll discuss it no votes after the election I think it's smart give the voters in this country and that will play out in in congressional races all around the United states quoting here in Wisconsin\nA chance to decide how you want to go forward Democrats like to say it's all about the wall forgetting of course but it's about border security it's about human trafficking it's about drugs coming across that border it's it's a lot more than that\nDemocrats have won the day in the media was their argument that sanctuary cities and lax immigration policy somehow fair to people\nFor getting of course all the negatives that come with that so I teach laws so important and and and that's a piece of legislation because it talks about a woman killed in the act of being a tourist in San

are willing to have these tough conversations and and Kevin McCarthy congressmen McCarthy uses fight in the way that it should be used not a physical kick in the head\nManner than Eric Holder uses but in the policy\nDiscussion that say you know what we think it's important to have a border that matters we think it's important to not let Ninety percent of the drugs to come to Wisconsin cross the border illegally we don't take young girls and young boys should be trafficked across that border\nAnd last week we don't think that cities should harbor criminals\nSome of who do the things I just talked about\nVoters have another one of those clear choices you have another chance to weigh in on a national conversation and you can force elected officials through your votes to move the country in the right direction\nNot to say that we shouldn't do something for children of illegal emerge immigrants the president is already laid out a platform for that that's something we should do not to say we shouldn't spend money on all the other things\nThat citizens in this country expect from the federal government\nBut there has to be real life implications\nAnd when I say well it's it's much

having me on\nAbsolutely we've talked a number of times and I was asking the question what's on voters' minds but as we get closer to November\nWe see the uh the enthusiasm we see the right direction but that was captured in the new law school pull the most recent one released yesterday that the state's going the right direction how do we take that energy of Wisconsin and shift at the Washington DC\nYou know I constantly got to look at the policies that got it wherever you think back to ten years ago where we weren't what's confident with higher unemployment and own values quality and people struggling\nWe elected a you know we elected Walker was elected Republicans to the state level we also elected Republicans in the house of representatives and took the speakers gamble away from Nancy Pelosi and started to chip away at your bothered ministry overreach and I look at it and say\nWe gotta keep putting policies in place that grow the economy pushed wages higher I keep going\nBetter off we are to drive our country for works\nLet's talk about policy when it comes to economic developments or we've seen company's ad space in their facilities and see them at employees we've seen new industries come to Wisconsin wages are starting to make a tick up what else can we do in that area to make that a reality as well for the workers of of this country\nYou have the final piece of that puzzle is probably trying to close their skills gap and so I serve on the University of Wisconsin border region spend a lotta time on education policy\nHow do we get our education programs so that individuals have the skills that they need to be prepared for the jobs that future how do we get technical college level training into our high school so you can prepare people to become say welders how do you get individual is are going to for your schools\nTo come out and be prepared to work in so driving that skills gap is really that next piece of the puzzle to allow people to move up the uh the career ladder and into jobs that pay higher higher wages and better benefits\n... Senate and the first congressional district joining me your opponents advocates for things like free health care for all I'm going to spend some time in the show talking about how unrealistic that is but when you hear promises light that\nDoes it drive you nuts and somebody who's worked in the private sector had to deal with the ... the real life realities of budgets does it does it drive you nuts when you hear a elected officials\nAre elected official wannabes make those claims\nYou can you can tell us talking points and these aren't talking points that really work in the real world and that's what's so frustrating that my opponent advocates free tuition that's just passing the buck on the taxpayers he's offering free health care as you noted that just passing the buck on the taxpayers and when people sit down and they think about it a little bit\nIt becomes pretty clear somebody's got to pay for that if you look at the government takeover of health care that the thirty two trillion dollar program by by a lot of estimates\nTake to conceptualize that right is tough but taking steps like that just to pay for that one program you would need to double double all income and business taxes and you're shifting more power to the government\nAnd so the contrast becomes really clear should the power to be in Washington DC making decisions on your behalf including your all of your health care decisions or should the power remain locally here in Wisconsin a with individuals and doctors at the center\nAnd if people sit down and think about it and go level below or the talking points usually the night parties voters in southeast Wisconsin are really smart and once you get past the talking point people see right through um you know those false promises\nExpertise we're

in politics at least Wisconsin politics as the law school a poll came out I Want to play again and played early in the show or what Charles Franklin from the ambulance group all talking about the races to watch in Wisconsin\nHave shifted a bit and walkers direction he has forty seven percent a verse forty six percent that's obviously way inside the margin of error so it's a toss up even had led that by five in our September Paul and uh he slipped by three of 'em Dan Walker rose by three between\nThree weeks ago and today a but that race has looked tight other polling shows a little bit more of a neighbor's lead but we haven't seen outside polls in the state in about a month\nOf voices Charles Franklin who conducts the law school Paul so I said earlier on our feet if there's a couple of things that are encouraging for Republicans in the state of Wisconsin one that ah\nThe deficit that was a that Scott Walker was facing earlier is now a one point lead within the margin of error so keep that in mind [noise] ah and also\nAlthough it's it's not been affected by what happened on Monday at Monday's debate which I think was a a real house cleaning by we look nearer six hundred Tammy Baldwin at least at least on delivery messaging policy\nThat wasn't take into account in this poll and in the polling shows that are at least pre debates\nSenator Tammy Baldwin had attempt point lead fifty three to forty two percent but the encouraging number which I think is is kind of people some people have lost\nTrack of is the fact that the right way wrong ways for right track wrong track numbers suggest that Wisconsin thinks Wisconsin voters think that the state is moving in the right direction pretty significantly the numbers fifty four percent\nSo the states have the right direction forty percent said it's on the wrong track to look at that number fifty four forty that's an improvement from September one fifty percent of the state's going the right direction that suggests to me there is a rising tide for Republicans\nNo none of these races are easy and I'm looking at 'em they could all go either way lots of time between now and November six\nBut the encouraging thing is the trending heading in the right direction for Republicans whether it's Scott Walker or leave ... has much more heavy lifting to do then governor does making up at ten point deficit is never easy but that's just polling and if you factor in the margin of error that could be as as little as six\nThat is attainable that is doable for state certainly would burn\nAs I said this is pre debates that debate was pretty clearly won by ... here and I've asked my listeners when I put it out on social media as well watched the debate I've watched it almost three times now\nLook at the inability of

Canada is about to be the second nation you're ... the other one to legalize recreational marijuana so my country not putting it in the states we have a few states Colorado\nOregon and a few others will have legalized marijuana Canada is a country that's going to do and that's going to kick off fairly soon here so the chief of the world Health Organization I I I Would say his name but it's it's

says of course we believe that people were needed especially for pain management should have it there should be access\nThat access should be clear the regulated and throwing open the doors to full

Institute I wanted to get to the specifics I got a bunch of taxing emails yesterday\nAbout single payer health care and we've heard Tammy Baldwin and others Randy\nBryce talk about why we all need that\nTo be a healthier in this country and those of us on the other side of the aisle say pump the brakes got to understand what is going to cost how it would damage the current health care system in in our country which is one of the best on the planet let's be honest\nSomeone have Chris Rochester come on you're talking about the specific the dollars associated with something as uh\nDollars associated with something as a radical because the idea of a single payer system for health care in this country that's coming about eleven thirty five but I started with this one since its base law weekend Milwaukee and for those of you who don't know and you're too young to remember\nFundamental difference between the two people running for that seat to replace Paul Ryan one individual\nHas the the smarts\nAnd the intelligence and really the life history that suggests he understands what what the weather can be in Congress person is all about the other is a vigil has been arrested nine times

Congress in my district which is the first congressional district\nRight now we're talking about the Tomahawk shop and what it means\nFor race relations in this country are the differences between people and should still be used at sporting events the Atlanta Braves still embrace it they make it part of their fan experience I highlighted some of the things that are doing is it appropriate let's go to Bonnie in short when you're on WGM say good morning Bonnie\nHi no I think that how about hockey is a bad idea I grew up in Minnesota on the engines and give lane reservation or the kids in my class for about twenty five percent of Americans and the only term that they can derogatory\nRedskins mhm I had had\nIndian boyfriend and I called them to your on him and he loved it [laughter] my red skins was that give rise to return em Tomahawk um you know when you call it representation by your bad thing and then it meant the Indians are killing\nPeople do you think you are you surprised that it's still going on in a in a major league ballpark\nGroup makes\nIt makes money ... ... pounds\nRight oh sorry I didn't mean to cut you off Bonnie I hit the button too early but thanks for the call appreciate the call from Charlotte [noise]\nI got some textures weighing as well I can a mortgage talking types line and we're also on Facebook a dot com as well I'm\nFrom the nine zero six only fuss racist to be pirates raiders buccaneers cowboys giants forty niners Vikings I've heard that argument before that there's other terms that the kind of\nYou know told that line when it comes to inappropriate necessarily you know the Vikings are the Vikings and I'm frankly she looked at their history most of us be horrified and in modern terms but um\nTo lots of the folks in Minnesota from the nine to oh I have no problem with the teenagers but the stereotypical mocking champs de to go I actually can't believe that the NC double a still a lousy you need to be to plant the spirit midfield at Florida State games and I also mentioned the Atlanta Braves here's my take\nYou're not going to\nSeparate deal of the Atlanta franchise with the name brands that's not going to happen and frankly the use of the term brave or Braves\nDoesn't have to be offensive but I think when you go to the level of encouraging fans at a sporting events in major league baseball to do the Tomahawk shop I think that rises to another level and I think there is a level of uncomfortable when it comes to the state of affairs amongst all of us in this country now\nA Florida State does it as well the Seminoles as the texture mentioned\nI think there's a place\nTo kind of say at some point maybe it's not now maybe it's a year from now five years from now sometimes these legacy fan celebrations or performances need to kind of just generally go away doesn't mean you have to make it\nA a magnet ... and say boom this is gonna forever change sometimes transitions can be easier uh you don't want to Ralph your fan base certainly that's probably one of the reasons is still exists but there's a time in a place for things\nAnd I don't expect I as I said of the Atlanta Braves have changed their name I didn't even expect to Washington Redskins to change your name and as we heard from a caller that's clearly offend some people\nBut maybe a Tomahawk chop chop shouldn't be part of an official teams sanctions sand promotion\nMaybe I should be a line that are frankly should be moved back a bit it does seem offensive to me and I you know I don't know the guy that offended by a lot but I think that that's one of those things that crosses the line let's go to Jeff in a while I was hosting a debate teams in the morning Geoff\nI'm On a great go uh it's very good topic you know we got it from your people um you know that we're working out of control\nOr that you know um they should be you know it's not really the heart of it you know don't let them work ... ... yeah mogul but\nYou know like on the market and our values and very into dollars we wait for my money on ...\n... there's there's a frustration I think by fans when when the team's overreact to this stuff and I I'm not advocating for that I just think it's nice to have your sensitivity at least a number of the name but just on the action\nWhat about a vote I mean you know have their own or wherever they are like a pirate very you know the right thing and I mean how far can we take it you know yeah um that's my point no and little\nYeah thanks for the call Jeff I mean Jeff feels like a lot of people do that some of these things are just the way that they've been and then we we as fans we get comfortable with that some one that's actual says Florida State pays the seminal nation they use that name\nThat does that wouldn't surprise me up from the nine to all the time I talk to me represents violent some deaf how would teams like opposing fans waiting finger guns and chanting bang bang think about it that's a from Belgium, Wisconsin\nThese aren't easy issues fans are rabbit they support their teams they have traditions probably like and and habits and customs probably like no other group in our country\nAnd as I said it's it's less about the names to me it's more about the actions and and that's one at least in the in the area\nCertainly Florida state's in Atlanta that I I wouldn't be surprised to see that go way I'll take more of your calls in tax for one for seven nine nine one six twenty is the Tomahawk chop racist or is it not more than X rated teams you\nAre and our insurance provide the knowledge

L. C. S. between the brewers and the Dodgers this was an exciting time in Milwaukee\nAre now we're talking about a tradition of specifically the Atlanta Braves they're chopping and chanting the Tomahawk chop ... weighing in\nOne of the Texas challenges me so I think it said it best earlier today lighten up Francis David ... Tomahawk shop is okay but it's very annoying run from the two six two didn't passive is Jane Fonda do the job when she did it Ted Turner I Believe that's correct\nIt's an interesting look at sports right we have these traditions these customs these habits of fans and in the case is Lana Braves they encourage their fans to participate they dim the lights\nEncourage him to hold up their phones and to chance and to do the ... job so that's it's a different environment in Atlanta and\nIt's a different environment in Atlanta and if you don't know Atlanta\nIt's I'm a minority majority community at least I think that's the most recent census information I've seen so it's not like they're not attuned to how people feel about these issues and not Atlanta that does this and we mentioned Florida State Seminoles not easy conversations to have\nFrom the for one for I Am sick and tired of all this who cares if it's not they don't like it I really want to chop these people just the thing they do get over it\nThat's a common feeling as well as I said I'm not going to stop them from doing it I think\nFor ten years and an important note the entire state budget projected for the er twenty Nineteen the entire state budget state and federal spending here in Wisconsin is always thirty eight billion dollars\nI was just going to bring it out 'cause I was looking at those numbers so what do you say to somebody like Tammy Baldwin US Senator junior senator from Wisconsin who says it costs more to do nothing\nWell I think that a completely untrue I'm doing nothing would be exactly the opposite of what a what the\nObamacare and all these government involvement schemes and healthcare of done\nWhich is drive up the cost of health care or the you know a study by the Mercator center which took a look at the Bernie Sanders fill a packed the national cost at thirty two trillion dollars and even that was a conservative estimate\nAnd they they noted in that study what Obamacare critics have noted is that when you\nDecrease the ah when you're decrease of supply which is what you do under the single payer health care system by reducing reimbursement rates and effectively running providers out of business out of the out of the market\nOr you and you also increase the demand that it that causes a just a downward spiral in terms of both praise and the availability of the access to healthcare so\nThe ... of people like Senator bald winter or simply wrong\nThat the government should do much less and in terms of the health care sector and we found that out from Obamacare\nWe're talking to Chris Rock is or communications director for the my confidence is one of the other things is not talked about as the chaos that would result in blowing up\nThe medical medical fields the the the uh hospital systems the employer provided health care system long down all up the chaos and Rick cause for the individual employees and consumers of healthcare that's an whole additional part of this story that doesn't get talked about it enough\nTo have the right I kind of touched on that they are but one thing that I did not do in the report which actually or what should we weigh out all our work on our website MacGyver with dot com you can take a look but one thing I did not do\nHis ... as I did not do the impossible which is to figure out what exactly would be the fallout\nOn the health care sector I didn't add costs and for him to the man as it's called when the theory that if the government picking up the tab for all health care or in other words the taxpayer picking up the tab for all that they have all health care\nOr people are going to use their her more are going to go to the hospital more you know for minor thing\nA and that can result in any way of life and on top of that anybody even knows a few things about Medicare and Medicaid and all of that the government reimburse of a providers doctors hospitals at a lower rate than the private insurance stuff so\nUnder a single payer system or you can expect that to be the case which mean doctors and hospitals get short chain\nAnd there's no way of knowing that it's almost certain that a fairly good percentage\nOf Dr as well just quit for business especially ones that are close to retirement as it is and hospital will be either forced to go out of business dramatically changed their business model or continue the map trend towards math consolidation\nOr that they actually done at the own share of harm other Obamacare a and so you're right that would be a a hand grenade into the healthcare industry\nThat would result in the kind of weight lines we see in places like Canada and the u._k. a traumatic rationing of hair a and spiraling taught which is another reason for three three the estimate of thirty billion dollars and four hundred billion over ten years is a very very conservative\nAnd got a couple of minutes left with Chris Rochester communications director for the macabre Institute for those of us who believe in a free market and competition this was the opposite of that this is this is a controlling government than frankly doesn't do a good job in many other systems in programs they have to administer why would any of us\nDemocrats or Republicans think the government would do a good job with health care when they they miss the ban on so many other principal elements of what the government does for us\nWrite the government doesn't do much of anything efficiently and if you look at the VA system which is a flag that a little with inefficiencies weight lying and then\nIn some cases tragic mistakes or you look at that you look at the DMV and just about any government program or you see all the reasons you need why it would be terrible disaster to completely eliminate competition and replace it with\nGovernment as it would be a terrible disaster and I think the left as learning exactly the wrong lesson from Obamacare the reasons why Obamacare is a disastrous failure is because of government and ball is because of top down one size fits\nAll mandates out of Washington DC and the exact wrong lesson to learn that we need to double and triple down on government involvement healthcare which is what the single payer scheme as a vote of the state level and the one proposed by Sanders at the national level\nSome great research some wisdom and some reality injected into conversations from Chris Rochester communications director of the macabre Institute good stuff as always Chris thought that they have the\nYou know it's it's

I Would I don't know now I don't know who she looked like I don't know their status but ah she stressed that opinion that go to the ... opinion and now she's being crucified by a while\nBut you get CNN you get ... you get older that are actually the ... the legitimate news sources\nThat we count roughly find all news show these people are never built by\nThese people and they and they'll come out after that it'll and and then every of fire\nSo I don't understand why the Republican went though\nYou know this this has got to stop\nHere and I'll see them a couple of points on that I don't know what happened here and I and that's that is what is frustrating bill is because the Wisconsin broadcasters association their initial reaction was hey Nancy can go on television and say whatever she wants then by yesterday afternoon she resigned and I'm not sure what happened\nBut to your first point and I think it's really important\nThey'll you know what I've been in radio for thirty some years I wouldn't have known that she was the chair elect\nOf the Wisconsin broadcasters association have I seen that ad there was no connection you know if she does on TV and says this is Nancy Douglas chair of the Wisconsin broke out okay I get it but she didn't do that and I think your point is exactly right and\nHere's the other thing bill ... you know this this is chilling because as long as she doesn't identify with the trade association I think she's got the right to say these things and yes and I know that people don't believe that if she had gone on for Randy Bryce\nFeel the same way it's not related to her job\nAm I wouldn't know who she is and it wouldn't make any difference\nYou know and everyone has their own opinion either way but it's it's a charity is really what it is that it\nWent on whenever so everybody goes down and somebody gets fired or somebody with or you know why is that\nThe Republicans have stepped on a fire quit but he never CNN on never MSNBC and you're talking about people they are well known\nAnd then ... and ... and they knowingly also that they put out a story and that story all\nYou never hear in other words you know now he's here is I Know why or why are the Republicans just the one to get\nA pack the names of backing off as I say I hate that when that\nIt just seems so we always back all\nBill thanks a lot for the call appreciate it and that's and here's why I think I mean he made a ton of good points but here's what I think is his most important point nobody would have known\nCouple of tax to wrap this up\nBecause you can be there should be there okay a couple of sex to wrap this up so sad that the Republicans can only attack Randy Bryce on his mistakes rather than debate on policy because they know they will lose that one while using character I look I think character matters\nPresident Trump I'm highly critical of him on his character\nThe left is very critical\nSo character does that count or not\nIs it only got

talking tech wind\nAnd there's a phrase murdered among ZZ Packer fans in circles around the United states that would indicate Mike mccarthy is wasting Aaron Rodgers career that Aaron Rodgers has is unbelievable town which he is and a boy only one Super Bowl that tends to be a phrase you hear a can't seem to get to where they need to get to board defenses really left his team down\nA dollar you viewing this whole situation because\nYou've missed assignments two receivers in the same spot I look at the all twenty two on occasion and I think to myself okay this is Mike mccarthy scheming to get guys open I've actually seen more of that than I thought the last couple of weeks and I've also seen Aaron Rodgers does not throw it to the open guy\nIf he sees a guy like device on the Adams even if he's got tight coverage now I'm In a one on one situation he's going there I forget about mark his Valdez gambling Fifteen yards open the over the middle standing by himself\nHere it is not always going to the open guy now this this year they this is what I'm noticing this you're looking at the at the film the all twenty to where you see where every player on the field is at a given time and then he also said that the decision made by the quarterback but here it is missing some guys and he's not throwing it to the open guy that I mean that's just to get back to what I was saying\nIs not one thing and I know it's easy to say that you know it's the play calling it's the ... the ski Maddox it's it's the concepts but the fact of the matter is the execution I I Would start there the execution has not been there and again you look at drops you look at penalties it's it's in the late ... throughout the entire off and it's not one guy injuries\nI don't want to gloss over it I don't want to make an excuse of it but I mean you you again you got three rookies out there and there's clearly a trust\nOr a lack of trust 'em or trust that hasn't yet been established between Rogers and St brown and and more um so you know you've you've factor all these things together and what you have is that often that has looked stagnant that is looked stale\nBut I went back and and you know every week I I like to go through a every snap and look at the personnel group that the Packers put out there and there were some wrinkles that ended a truck into we hadn't seen all year ah we saw Montgomery and judge on the field a couple of times where they had two running backs said the first time you've done that I think they did it two or three times and the first half\nAnd I think they did it two or three times and the first half\nA doesn't sound like much but it's an unskilled and look you know it's something different so Robert Tanya getting some snaps offensively in the first half we saw for tied ends on the field I'll be the goal line situation for I Believe the first time of year they did that in the second half as well so there are a few things that Mike mccarthy showing that that's different that we haven't seen in the first four weeks of the season\nThey just haven't been executing a and I'm\nAside so that's why I say I I start there and that I that I really truly believe in it it's execution yes you want to get our Jones involved but yet you wanna get Jimmy Graham ah involved while you're going to let the targets um you know against the lions and that kind of more when I'm expecting one a week by week basis it just simply hasn't happened up to this point but it's a team that\nWhite now offensively cannot get out of its own way\nLet's go to Alan Chicago on WGM Jay Hi you\nGuys are I'm not going to put this on anybody except\nFor I'm I'm a little bit on Aaron Rodgers I mean I I'm I'm a uh the get how many passes and then if you put one or two of those together you know get all go on there and you got something a whole different ball game I'm not one McCarthy at all I think uh\nI enter a turtle that I got one here\nIn a month because he was talking about earlier today Jeff I Will get his comments coming up in a moment in the I think you will find out at the end of the season Aaron Rodgers is playing with something more significant than we're led to believe for us I think you'll find out what exactly is towards the end of the season\nBut it the way I see these on the field is playing the results have to be better they really do I go in and there are so many facets students was it the previous GMO didn't you know start piling up proven talent on this roster is it the scheme is it a ... in all the voice head coach that\nHas done some week into the office of system but never really overhauled it and it at times can view predictable or is it a injured quarterback who I I don't believe in skills are eroding\nBut there's also a a maybe a lack of trust you and you're just not only the guys who are standing by themselves in the middle of the field I did one of a number of things but at the office can't carry this team and prop up the defense but they're not going to win six games it's all of the above\nAnd and to ... point when I Would say is I think what we know about this team and it's unfortunate that they're not good enough to overcome those mistakes and you see what you just missed it open wide receiver or even a basic Crosby makes two of those field goals in the first half who knows how differently the second half plays out\nOr in the past they were able to overcome a lot of those mistakes again some of it is it's a different Aaron Rodgers it's just not the same guy that were used to seeing a but we're at a point where those little mistakes those little things just one penalty I'm One of the Dr ... believes in the first half the back of a certain goal\nRogers under pressure a message of getting flack for intentional grounding and I think it was like a forty two you're forty four yard it across the ... and you have to think if you just throw the ball away okay and or whatever you just throw it out of the end zone\nOkay it's a ... there's three points and who knows how differently to second athletes who knows you know how how the game plays out differently for Crosby you know if he just gets one of those first half kicks through the upright they can't overcome those little things and that's a big problem\nFor one for seven nine nine at one six twenty if you'd like to join us here on the program this is ... Packers play book coming up at six forty three will hear from Aaron Rodgers has more to the media a little bit earlier today are back after this and WGM Jay\n... gene thirty three areas it's been voting snow in its place to get ready for winter today is the king themselves\nSo they would build power center capital driving Brookfield you're authorized Aaron dealer bill powers dot com boom line of Aaron ...\nAnd making it in a briefing community Patrick ... caliber senior and that's handling with the planting needed to make the right move interesting everything community the previous devoted to providing for an supporting the independent lifetime of older I\nProbably have concerns throughout south eastern ... every campaign designed to natural comedy seniors that could provide for all they need so they can drive and enjoying this incredible ... wellness program say they are care restaurants have tiny recreation community\nSigns of activities all at the heart of everything we do to learn more about our service hands or to explore different communities and find them that's home for you or you're not doing that ... community that ... that's ... communities dot com\nOr college apt to to maintain a twelve twenty four when we come join the conversation\nTo six to seven nine and twelve twenty four countries in your community\nNot just my mind\n\n\n... fell tonia with me and that probably will be in with rivers weekly coming up at eight oh seven tonight at this time\nTomorrow will be entering pregame coverage showed the brewers in ... CEOs game number one remember on the weekend or I should say on Monday or the Packers game can be found on her sister station Ninety four or five Katie our country\nYou know the brewers and Dodgers will be in game three of this and they'll see a series for one for seven nine nine ... six twenty the mortgage talk in sex wind trying to get to the bottom of the Packers issues on our fence it defensively we knew it was going to be a bit of a work in progress this year young guys injuries new system\nThe defense has never been the calling card I knew it was recently for the Packers but often simply not holding up their end of the bargain either right now why is that\nJohn has an elk horns during that goes to double duty I'm Jay or John\nHi how're you doing thanks good well good\nWell you know I I Can't say that if you like to hang onto the ball and not go and and then you can't blame him for that\nHe's not getting that protection you need and what is an mobility right now it even harder for him to get out of pocket ... ... I Believe they should go to more run\nOr ... exactly I mean and that was the point that I was trying to make 'em before he went to a break is that this is a team that just the little mistakes that maybe didn't cost him in the past is hurting them now and unfortunately that's the sign of a team that is average that the sign of a team that's not going to go to the post season and where you stand now and I mean if you think in any given year ten wins gets you to the post season\nWell and they see NASA when eight games between now and the end of the season at the rams at the patriots at the Vikings at the bears at the sea hawks short week there's going to win like three out of those five games\nAlong with all of the other uh home games to get to that ten when mark that's a lot of work to do and I only got ... a long way to go but that just shows you how much different and how much more\nDifficult disease and have that vote one for seven and nine one six twenty Jonathan in Chicago joining us Jonathan how are you\nWow and yourself thanks for taking my call but I Would agree with everyone that um you know it's a bunch of factors and a few minutes at best mediocre um when I compared the receiving corps regardless if they're hurt or not\nTo look at the super bowl group when Shorty was a fourth receiver he was ... when\nI'm you know you see I mean you have your ... your driver I don't think it'd be you know these guys are just dropping passes and I think there's a component of Ronald game I think you often said why they just don't have I you know really what it boils down to it maybe coaching\nAnd maybe there should be a change but I mean that's a bunch of different issues that either but I'm just trying to I focused or identify won them it gets caught\nIf you're in Rogers plays the rest of the season and the Packers finished under five hundred and don't make the playoffs this will be the last year for Mike mccarthy is a coach I Can't see them coming back even kind of a transition year\nThe coordinators the position coaches I mean you you've already done that you know what I mean it in ... not that it all falls on coaching but\nYou wonder if you just you got to start over in that position well and I think Michael 'cause he's been in if prime coach for the Packers for a long time and look around the league how many coaches are blasted beyond a decade of the same spot marvel Lewis somehow somebody and Bill Belichick and I'm Mike Tomlin ...\nAbout it yeah I'm of course ... you know uh and so I thought it was Super Bowl ... as one that nevertheless um you know two things I I think number one it's going to take a non playoff non winning season\nFor Mike mccarthy to lose his job and a lot of people you know as you would expect that after the loss\nOn Sunday on Packers okay we're going to make a change in all of the ... the reality is no change is going to take place until the end of the season but I think if you are looking for change in this upcoming season again I mean look it's October so who knows what's going to happen over the next couple of months\nTo me it seemed like after last year they started to be a real sense of urgency that Aaron Rodgers while the window is still open\nYou know the end of the career is it out there you know and it's a lot closer than it used to be and you get the sense that this team could still won the Superbowl but it's going to have to take more than just getting by which I think there's definitely did twenty Fifteen threw up to the point the Rogers got hurt and and twenty Seventy so um I Would agree I think this is ...\nTwenty Seventy so um I Would agree I think this is again that's why it's a big church is a big game against San Francisco and then you hope that you're pretty healthy after the by you're going to need it because your it's one big time game after\nAnother after the boss got a couple of lines for you to join us for one for seven nine nine to one in six twenty leading

expect\nTo kind of issues that I'm seeing an office definitely and when he talked about those Fifteen scripted planes that ... the reps their study that this is how we're going to start the game this is how we start ... this is how we take control there are a lot of that before they get halfway through\nBecause of down two touchdowns in the first quarter in some of these games so those scripted

even if it's fourteen to nothing but again it's\n... and uh just to be clear I I I Do think Mike mccarthy you know get some of the blame for this but I I'm going to go back to just the sheer execution and and just the the the number the laundry list of problems that we've gone through here with this all sense\nA and it you know at times more often than not in fact it hasn't been good but even when
