[noise]\nGeorge webs only a few hours away from handing out those free burgers or those vouchers which is a good idea all those folks who\nCan't get there two to six can still get their chance at a at a at that opportunity was just just a fun way to celebrate them and everything right winning streak\n'cause I tell you my mother in law saved her burger rappers from the last time I was thinking about that I told the story I don't know if you were in student wants to when I was sure that the guy had a bronze the burgers last time the cost of a hundred and fifty bucks why why do you do\nYou get to his dad who lived in Iowa as a as a Father's Day president that's excellent 'cause his dad and him had gone to the games ten eleven twelve of that streak and eight of\nThem that call someone who is going to get their burger bronze this time around\nI don't know but one of the ... that's fantastic idea so I don't know who's doing wrong thing anymore but that was in that case it was JC penny I'm guessing probably not any more because you all don't you remember browsing ... baby shoes oh yeah yeah\nThe more we now in the United states was JC penny I'm guessing probably not any more because you all don't you remember ... baby shoes oh yeah yeah that was his name right I mean what are you going to house everybody had him that's not a thing anymore but\nIt kind of shows you the difference in generations but that was this thing for brewers fan some of those folks bronze their burgers\nNow take pictures of ourselves eating burgers and then we posted\nVery ruined down we take a selfie with our burger solve all the folks are of course ten o'clock I was you for that time the biggest stories as we see it across wanting to stay in the world joining us for number two is Governor Scott Walker that's coming up attempts at the number one of course is the brewers\nAre a couple of games at Dodger Stadium at Chavez Ravine but uh you know what this team of surprise us all year long they're ready for the challenge to games at Miller Park\nHopefully starting tomorrow Ryan Braun is confident\nEvery single person in this organization would be thrilled at the beginning of the year you said you're going to have to win two games at home\nDuring the world series or what have you know the guys that are going to best starting pitchers all year I'm ready to go for us to fully rested bullpen\nAll right you got to win both\nYou know Ryan Braun you obviously have the controversy with all the things with the with the er the steroids and all that stuff but he's a guy that gets\nI think you get the experience he's a player who knows what it takes and frankly look his performance in the end all cs actually hit pretty well so he's a guy that delivering it at that moment when stars should shy I Hope the rest of the team gets that message and I\nAnd I agree with them you know what you have to do it right there at home you're home ballpark you played well they win almost two to one and home used to have during the season when they play a Miller Park\nJust focus on tomorrow night when tomorrow night and then all bets are off and you're thinking I've been in the game so\nYou think wait a minute he's tired from his appearance [laughter] isn't that crazy wondering how people\nWould react to that if baseball purists we'd be bothered\nBy apparently some are I could care less because what seems to make\nYou know what why do you care why do people care about most of the brilliant maneuver I'm actually surprised it's never been done before has it I mean that's been done before yet\nBut here's the thing I think all of us even though we're biased and brewers fan credit counseling done it a masterful job with his pitching staff in the series and in season right it didn't work out for him so well yesterday I mean what else was outstanding but after that not so much you know what\nYou gotta blame the hitters it's you've got a score run into ... ... you can only be killed simply shut the whole time you have to be able to hit the ball\nWhat about my premise of the two three to set up a bit of this and I'll see you have to actually hurt the brewers they're going three games in in LA you know\nWhat I hear that all the time every year I hear that our our two three do not fair I don't know I think I mean you have two games in home now you you finished the series at home or else would you want to be\nYou know bottom line you're supposed to wait in your home playoff games this is these are two home playoff games hopefully starting tomorrow Miller Park you could do I think in hockey they do to to one one one yeah\nA lot of travel though yeah unless you're talking about mid west west coast but do they do it yeah I I suppose it is rough especially the worst part was Thirteen any game\nEarly afternoon game the next day right now is a killer for the doors and boy there seem like they retired and whether or not the players retired so give me started on some times ago [laughter]\nAll right that was every one of our for I'd send the four biggest stories as we see the cross in Washington state in the world coming up next Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker joins us live right here in ...\nTennessee with you on this Thursday we're now joined by Wisconsin's outstanding Governor Scott Walker in the morning\nHey good morning great to be with you thanks for him out\nSo I got to ask you before it gets in the politics this brewers thing isn't as somebody who's running for office running for reelection does that get in the way or do you just to kind of adds to the experience when you talk to all the focus on what's going on it's hard\nTo make that fine makes it enjoyable you know and I travel or even if it's during a time we got it on the radio we we're yesterday I was in the event that had ended up\nOn my phone checking the score give people a day because I was talking 'cause it was obviously an earlier ... now that's a lot of fun and it gives me an excuse to dress down and whenever you're all the time so I'm looking back\nAlthough I don't know that can get away with it tomorrow that they made the debate thrown at at eight I may have half the moderator to give us an occasional update\nWent out of the ...\nYeah most people will be watching the game and probably if if anything taping or so or saying I'd say about the birds were probably already know by the time that watches\nHow's this uh this reelection bid different than last time\nWell just adapt to climate so much difference so you know in two thousand fourteen as we did it to the camera can have the winter or back and and that's not you know a lot of people tied into the current president it's really more just historical I mean when Obama was the president Republicans did well in the off years\nAnd all this talk about the the uh\nThe feelings of your students yeah that's part of your job description but you're part of your job description of it is also make smart decisions\nAnd whether it was you whether it was your principal whether it was your drama director you all screw this up you could have had these meetings you got these meanings outside of the of the production of this play to kill a mocking bird and the and I'm going to go back to this before I ended up to Eric\nYou missed a teaching opportunity but it's just that some of you maybe all of you have never read the book that the plays based on\nIt talks about racism and segregation exposes it\nTells you why those things were wrong then as they are now you missed an opportunity here you embarrass yourself what's your back and forth decision making foolishness I don't know how you\nCome back from something like that and all these other things you talked about your press conference yesterday none of that has\nAnything to do it to kill a mocking bird is things if you wanted to do you could have done years ago\nThat's number three of our Fort Sam the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee to stay in the world coming up next the latest on the show your parents to the reporter for the Washington Post who uh is presumed dead we the latest on that\nStory five years ago the north of trials abortion doctor ... one of the authors of the book which by a draft of this story today has twelve thirty five jury filling in for Jeff Wagner today noon the three tomorrow\nJerry will be in my shift eight thirty five to noon as I broadcast live from Miller Park new industries looking forward to them we talking a lot of brewer ... interviews like we did last week as the brewers get set for game six brewers Dodgers live from Miller\nPark and you can hear all of that right here on WGM program note if you missed our W\nTMZ cares piece this morning it's\nKnown as high test page a great story that air did with survivors of nine eleven fantastic piece by or does that and a part of our WGM daycares raise the beam project\nIf you can help us out please do so it's a great project can you ask them but it's really an area wide project a kind of connecting our past\nHistory with those of us who are younger and ... and those of us who have maybe don't even remember much about nine eleven anymore so great project in our community so you can check it out on our podcast page will have the Governor Walker interview as well up on the package as a page this afternoon so I think that Governor Walker for joining us today live\nWill wrap up to four I attended with this one Eric\nIt's it's the strange case of Saudi journalist ... his Yogi disappeared supposedly\nPunt potentially murder now seem more likely you stand bolt a office\nInvestigation is taking place in Turkey I ruined his now awaiting secretary of state Mike Pompeo made a trip to the middle east this week he met with the president this morning to discuss his visit\nIn his meetings with Saudi and Turkish officials concerning the disappearance of milk and she'll be of course with the Washington Post columnist there he says he wants to get the Saudis a few more days to look into this investigation by\nWe made clear to them\nSo we take this matter with respect to Mr Chevy very seriously\nSo for now Pompeo suggested let's take a few more\nDays old President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have a complete understanding of the facts surrounding that point we can make decisions about how the United states should respond so\nHere's the thing how do you respond because they are an ally and important\nWhen they're an important strategic\nAlliance of the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nAnd some would say that Saudi Arabia is now moving toward a little bit more of a westernized feel to it so you don't want to disrupt what has become a growing relationship in some aspects with the U.S and I mean they've even reached out to Israel in ...\nWhat has become a growing relationship in some aspects with the U.S and I mean they've even reached out to Israel in some aspects of peace and all that so you you don't necessarily want to disrupt all that so what do you do when it really it looks like Saudi wasn't\nGoing on at such a nightmare scenario for President Trump's assistant as Middle East policy on closer relations with Saudi Arabia and that young crown prince and so now he's tried to walk a fine line between preserving that relationship and standing up with American leadership against in a parrot act of Savage murder\nI mean as the international relations go this is probably as complex as a gas you know we don't know exactly the details yet uh Mike Pompeo was on the ground in several countries trying to assess what happened for the president's\nIt's it has to be a wait and see a you mentioned the fact that Saudi Arabia has seemed to suggest that there are more open to a westernized sort of a sudden a government that's not the case with the crown prince\nHe's a dictator and he acts like a dictator he doesn't put up with any nonsense and there's a lot of folks in the intelligence community who think he's the guy that directive is now he'll never admit to that of course like a lot of dictators they do things that never get the light of they signed on them the president is faced with a challenge here\nYou have a great relationship with a country we need that ally in the middle east\nYou can't blow it up it's going to it's going to\nRequire great sophistication\nOr some some gentle a nudging of an ally but at the same time holding people responsible for the president to this point two years almost two years into his presidency has not been a president that suggests that would play give it a strength and I'm being nice about them\nThis is going to be a tough one now we still have to wait and see what the actual details are but all signs point to murder of the Saudi journalist ... and for the president this might be the toughest\nCase he's had to solve in international relations since he took office so that's number for about four at San after the break\nAnybody trust Facebook anymore well they're they're getting ready\nTo deal with the next election next big election mid term\nElections in the United states anybody trust these guys to kind of figure that out of bringing a story next right here on WGM Jay holidays\nCorner W seems backwards annual holiday radio shows ... percent of the night before Christmas signed Jean mailer shame matinee or Jeff Wagner\nIn a sleigh full of Wisconsin celebrities from Turner hall in downtown Milwaukee and Monday November twenty six at six thirty the live radio play ... will be recorded in front of a studio audience and you can be a part of it by tickets now go to W. TMZ dot com or text the word Christmas to Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty\nYou want to be there it is a blast as there are a lot of surprise guess I was in ... I was part of it last year as a newbie here it's every team Jay ... is a lot of fun so join us have Turner hall\nOr to the folks who can't make it also be rebroadcast right here in the DMZ throughout the holidays so kind of a fun way to listen to our annual tribute to Christmas and the holidays\nAlright Facebook I've talked about this subject before but um as as the mid term elections get closer\nAnd what are we remember about twenty sixteen Facebook was accused of participating in a scheme by people that weren't in the United states of a priority as opposed to try to influence our election and twenty sixteen our presidential election\nNow\nCEO of Facebook the creator of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg at the times and it was crazy\nBut as we know that story developed to the point where they now know we now know that thousands of ads\nPromoting false storylines force false information replaced by Russian agents ... eventually said that he would make it as personal challenge to fix them\nWell one of the ways they've approached that is with something called their war room it's been one piece of this big ongoing project to kind of fix this issue\nAnd it uses a lot of the artificial intelligence systems are facing Facebook has been using to help identify what's authentic and with actual user behavior\nAnd then they they use this war room and they give other people look at this thing as we approach November six\nTheir director elections and civic engagement and I said there is no substitute for physical real world interaction the primary thing that I've learned is just how effective it is that people in the same room altogether so they're going to look at the activity on their platform as it leads up to November six\nNow twenty different teams of employees and twenty thousand people mostly independent contractors they've hired\nWhose sole purpose is to black fake accounts fictional news\nCurtailing other efforts on Facebook related to the election\nNot\nFacebook to me is always seemed like one of those incredible stories of incredible success and incredible wealth that seems like it's run out of her garage somewhere in\nCalifornia with hardly any oversight all they have thousands of employees because I I see states will see it every day and I see how people interact with it I see some of nonsense that's on there and it does give you pause to think\nObstructed any effort to look at those um intrusions\nRobert Mueller from all accounts is looking to wrap this up by the end of the year nothing before the election and that's not uncommon typically are agencies like the FBI and special counsel don't do anything to impact national elections and I think that's going to be the case here\nBut my question for you is really a simple one\nWhat do you think mother's gonna find so far we've had in ... minutes on a number of individuals Russian agents who are frankly never going to see a prison cell one you're not going to get him back to the United states for trial too\nThey may now be used have users they're correct identities but for the Michael Flynn's that George Papadopoulos is that Paul Manafort others it's really been about financial misdeeds\nThe fact that they were doing things off of the well before the Trump campaign even got underway that have now gotten him into serious trouble in the case of Paul Manafort potentially serving many many years in prison\nBut rarely when you look at them all the rest of the nation that's not what he was brought in for it was about collusion and whether or not there was an attempt by foreign agents interfere in our elections and so far that hasn't been the case at least as far as the findings and the information has come out so far\n\nFrom the forum on for one of the times there's ways that only one is for the investigation country fair and fact based conclusion and for all Americans to respect the process and the findings obviously we should hope there was no collusion but it's hard to speculate and you know there's been indictments and some of those include the administration and Russians we need to know the truth\nThat's probably one of the most level headed common sense approaches to this thing that I could read or hear\nI don't care what party\nOr who you ally yourself with if you really care about the future of the country you want to make sure that they are process is our elections are protected\nNow sitting here today there's been nothing publicly release that indicates to me that the president has anything to worry about that doesn't mean that Robert Mueller won't find something\n\nAs these indictments have come forward and these guilty pleas there are many figures tied directly to the Trump campaign including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort\nBut doesn't go to the desk of the president does it do that how does it reached down\nSo far it doesn't seem like for one for seven nine nine one six point of the accident mortgage talking ... as we head toward the end of twenty eight seen what do you think Mahler is going to come up with and do you think any of this\nTouches the presidents as I said so far it doesn't seem like it and the president has Saturn and many times called it a witch hunt or worse\nBut to this point at least the public information as release does not point to obstruction of justice justice or collusion by the president's for\nOne for seven nine nine when six twenty I can at markets talking tech science where do you think mother goes if he wraps it up by December does he connect the dots of the president or doesn't he that's the question right here on WGM June\nIt's a mother goes if he wraps it up by December does he connect the dots of the president or doesn't he that's the question right here on WGM June seventh\nThis is sort of is not a bad day in a in Wisconsin for October [noise]\nJordan was telling me Bruce Jordan was telling me how quickly this month is going by were already halfway more than halfway home don't forget like Seventy days the Christmas is that we're we're we're coming up\n[laughter] we're coming up fast and furious on a holiday so uh I'm actually at the time that what I'm Talking about because there's been a lot of indications\nThat the Robert Mueller will wrap up his investigation into collusion a fraction of justice before the holidays one of the factors asked me about why I said that um he wouldn't do anything before the elections\nI'm the one of the reasons that's the case is the Justice Department their guidelines said prosecutors should avoid any\nUh disclosures any major um announcements closer to election because they don't want to be seen as influencing the election so that's why I said that and and that has been the case I was like comedies decision to release information about the Hillary Clinton's email server investigation was so controversial some people not me they could cost of the election\nSo with roughly\nThree plus weeks to the election the term elections and you know as I said two and a half less than two months of the end of the year\nRobert Mueller is going to either\nPublic he released his findings less likely or release them two deputy AG Rod Rosenstein because of course attorney general Jeff Sessions excused himself a recused himself rather from this investigation\n\nThat's the two choices now what happens to the information of course depends on what's in that finding\nGiven the gravity of what we're talking about collusion obstruction I wouldn't be surprised if there's not some sort of a public pronouncements and that could go a couple of different ways as well\nNo this president did not colluded with Russia you know this president's didn't obstruct justice in the investigation into the into that collusion\n\nOr yes to both of those questions and then we have a much bigger story of course and then the ... the year and a half of investigation leads to\nAt least a year and a half of the fallout from those findings if there are yes\nIndications are yes a decoration in the in the investigation from the two six to I Believe what they will find as the Clintons were the people who have the main dealings with Russia I'm not confident you hear this through the media but in this case it was Hillary was doing everything she could win her people were not able to get it done\nDo I believe Trump communicated somewhat with Russian counterparts yes but nothing criminal like they're suggesting\nImagine what the tab will be for this investigation what a waste of money that's from Chris from the two six to\nIt's not an insignificant amount of money we're talking about I think at least twenty million dollars at\nThe last economy lots of money invested in this investigation now for the government they got indictments for a lot of different things wire fraud money laundering lying to the FBI they seize assets I think just from Paul Manafort those assets probably cover half the town\nWas that fruitful I guess but that's not what Robert mother was tested investigate\nAnd in fact the end of this which I think it's a it's a pretty likely ... has a pretty high probability of of being the case he doesn't find collusion or a structure of justice a lot of Americans are going to go and say to themselves or others what was the point of is\nThe Manafort's the Flanders Papadopoulos is\nThat information could have been green outside of a an investigation and the president and his conduct and his campaign's conduct\nAnd today the search the character of this president with an investigation that found nothing and this is almost a cliche because I'm sort of so many times but the only person that really knows this is Robert Mueller\n\nAll accounts wrapping this investigation up as we head to the new year frankly that's a good thing because if it finds as I think it will but there was no collusion we need to move on business frankly taken up too much airtime\nToo much of the oxygen in the room based on really\nI think in most cases Democrats wanting something to be their their inability to get over the twenty sixteen presidential election\n\nWhat does our occasional guest on the program Dennis Miller comedian say those are the Democrats have really gotten over that twenty six election not handling it very well well they're not look to California for example of that\nOut of their mind about this president out of their mind in what they're doing to try to bring this president down including their latest fiasco the cabinet nomination\nWherever won states\nMerely acting exclusively to try to take down a president based on what they saw happening twenty sixteen is that the illusion I Know you can call it that is it the arrangement trucked arrangement syndrome I guess but what it really is\nIs folks wanting something to be the case\nWith all the evidence suggesting that would actually happen we'll find out Robert Mueller will tell us at some point or Rod Rosenstein will tell us at some point what we're looking at here\nBut for all of us I think it's good news if those things can be wrapped up by December at least that's all signs point in that direction that is good news for the state more than ... seats pretty with you on WTO ...\nHoliday radio shows WPN papers on the night before Christmas sarin\nGina Miller shame Matt in there and Jeff Wagner and a sleigh full of Wisconsin celebrities from Turner hall in downtown Milwaukee and money November twenty six at six thirty the live radio play ... will be record in front of a studio audience and you can be a part of it by tickets now go to W.\nThink he's old fashioned to use out of touch and as as the voting population we said what they tell us is getting younger and that still yet to be proven and we'll see I guess to some extent in the mid term elections if that's true or not\nWe told that we're told that they're energized ramped up enthusiastic about voting for new styles of candidates is Joe Biden a relic of the past not met job I\nHad a one on one conversation with him smart guy experienced guy we disagree on most things he let me participate once in a ah a forum with him and that was the only Republican on the panel he he he he he made a lot of fun about that\nI had a lot of fun about that are interested in is the only Republican in the pound but he was a guy that he is very uh what's the word congenial\nVery down to earth but does he too old to be president for one for seven nine nine wants to one of the eye can emerge talking text line what do you say too old and we get into a situation now where\nIt's too many old people not enough young people running for office or is that experience\nThe wisdom that comes with age is that why we're seeing this trend seem to be wrapping up in the other direction more on that next right here let me see I'm sure\nA deal to fight for the state of suddenly well Dr Jerry ... project right here in the has new information on that story today as well\nTam a program note tomorrow Jerry and I will slip spots will Jerry we'll be doing my show in the morning\nI'll be out at Miller Park for that lead up to game six of the ... else yes\nI cannot wait Santa blasts out there last friday will do it again and got some great interviews lined up talking brewers are just some of that early on the show today or as we get ready for game six birds they know what they have to do it on to win two games and Miller Park to go to the world series to rewrite\nThe story of Nineteen eighty two in a different direction all these years later shut out to those folks a judge whether they're going to be are lining up actually don't have to wind up now because you can just get their hamburgers you can get vouchers and they have to wait in line anymore but uh and let's let's give George Web credit for that\nThat's a cool thing I notice a lot of free marketing and nobody does anything for free anymore but the fact that they on or something they're going to say that they did promise is a is a good thing\nSo credit supposed to George wherever there's thirty locations now in the state of Wisconsin I'm guessing they're going to be pretty busy today I'm actually go to George ... not for the voucher not for the\nI'm going to get some chicken soup\nThey're going to be pretty busy today I'm gonna actually go to George Web not for the voucher not for the hamburger\nI'm going to get some chicken soup I Hope to have chicken soup something by the airport has chicken soup I'll be on my way shortly All right before the break we're talking about how old is too old to be president let's go to Dan in ... you're on WGM say good morning Dan\nAnd their extra take my call to\nSay I'm what I Wanna that Saturday or listen I'm fifty years old and after I get done doing a bunch of things throughout the day or the week I get pretty get after I'm tired mhm I can imagine being Seventy five years old and plus and trying to stay in running the whole show that the country\n[laughter] it does seem like it'd be a daunting task\nOf course and uh you know I ... you know I Can't understand why you would want to\nThrow that at yourself the early day in and bail\nWell political ambition is is a is a pretty strong saying well let me let me approaches what's you this way so should there be an age cut off which and how would you enforce that\nOh I Can't really do that right now I mean there is no time or a age praying that you should dictate to it's whoever wanted the month but I Believe that these people just don't have the ability to hold that sustain themselves at that age\nYou're still young guys fifty I'm sixty and I and I I I I'm more on the line of I feel everything that I Do like a day or two later but I Can't even imagine the mental acuity you have to have her position like that I think for the call or let's go to Tony in Walker ... good morning Tony\nThank you\nI think that's totally martyrs because ... ... fine\nWho are now with the ... of the mountain well they have the lack of strain I just don't think there's any way I'm an owner can take that confidence how you\nLook at how they react on the campaign trail or look at the picture presidents when they\nWhen they see the way the overall ... how are\nYou are to light a negative for the term\nFamily not absurd\nTo as a surprise you that when we hear about all this enthusiasm of the young and the fact of the population is is has a a a lot more energy on the on the low end of the age spectrum for voting then we'll continue to see\nCandidates at this age sixty eight Seventy two Seventy five does that surprise you\nGet that for young people still want to know their parents from up their coworkers learned a lot of life in a life around to help her perspective on things\nWell thanks for the call Tony calling from Walker Charlotte squeeze in one more here Pam from Hartford you're on WGM Jay Carney Pam\nHi um I'm not eight year old who lives in Hartford and I'm already on experience or get hung up on our guy or woman should run for president after the age of sixty\nWow you as you said that that low on\nWhat so I Can't be president he was your rules I can be president [laughter] well\nThat's that's my comment\nAll right well thanks for listening Pam thanks for the comments on the age of the president's ... why why I think this is relevant Joe Biden right now is the leading candidate in the Democratic side for the nomination twenty twenty\nHe's Seventy five today he'll be Seventy seven when he starts running if he does run and that's not Fishell yet and to be Seventy eight when he took office he's the oldest person ever to take office as president\nSick about that for years later it'd be eighty two\nAre we really getting the best that we need in the most powerful position on the planet and I ... I think a better job still has that distinction\n\nThe thing is there's no way to force any of us are not going to say to somebody you're Seventy ... you can't run for president\nVoters decide these things they make the determination based on debate performance based on their primary performance getting the the most necessary to get the nomination\nAnd always needs to be about the voters this is one of those things it's surprising to me that as we here so much about the young people in this country other energized how they want to do things differently\nFirst look it's a democratic list of candidates for twenty twenty\nHas the oldest person has to clear leader in both getting let's go quickly to caffeine mosquito you're on WGM morning Cathy\nHi I'm just wanted to say that the pope and the queen I'm Better be worried about their jobs if five there is an age limit on how old it is that you are capable of I'm\nRunning a a group of people [noise] that's a great point I'll give you a ...

Kamala Harris Cory Booker they're grandstanding there's\n\nOnto the Daniel rolled around long enough on\n\n\nThere are\nMan of\nGreat work by one of our producers Ashton rotten and the game didn't work out the way we wanted\nAs I said I watch every bit of that game and uh so here we are with you know what the results last night a means we've got to win two games at Miller Park this team is shown all all season long they can get that done or are they still be crowds going to be electric\nA big high drama games who doesn't want that when you're talking about the Milwaukee Brewers right to its let's or in that trip to the world series\nWith two straight wins at Miller Park this weekend friday and Saturday I Will be at Miller Park tomorrow looking forward to that so my um my typical morning shift will be replaced by an afternoon\nNewness three shows at Miller Park after the break I Want to talk about our annual WGN jihadi radio show the night before Christmas\nI got to be part of this last year and and if you didn't see eventually just knocked me for being a former mayor but I'm going to be there this year\nNight before Christmas I got to be part of this last year and and if you didn't see it last year they just mocked me for being a former mayor but I'm going to be there this year\nWe'll see what happens of course they don't they don't clue me in on the writing but I'm I tell you about where you can go for tickets all the fun related to the story a it's a long long held tradition here at W. teams they are holiday radio show twenty Eighteen the night before Christmas so you do those details next we're hearing WGM Jay\nThe holiday season [noise]\nAm a scientist and having some fun with our ah those are and say holiday a radio show announced the night before Christmas I got to be a part of the same last year was funded although they did just mocked me mocked me incessantly about\nBeing a a former mayor of course it would be great city will create so this year's version called the night before Christmas it's going to have all the great people you've you've come to know and love at W.

always cells out\nAnd it's one of those great holiday to the ... of traditions right here from WGM Jay All right we're going to stay on our brewers theme after the news\nSo a couple of topics I Want to go into one\nMan even try to find yesterday by MLD they they're saying it's about a ten thousand dollar fine is that enough I heard some great commentary from some of the ... will be folks that said the other commentators on the ... will be that said uh some of his conduct his actions\nHis words may cost him some free agent dollars we'll see if that's the case because it's still going to sign a big a big contract\nAnd I'm also going to ask you the question what do you think the brewers when two at Miller Park and go to the world series here we are two games to in for a chance to go to the world series can they do it I Know the fans are going to show up\nIt's been an interesting series so far some of the stars from the regular season haven't had the best and else yes Christian yellowish very disappointing at the place will he wake up at Miller Park\nThe law of averages would say yes means a great hitter\nHad a great season MVPs season I think he's the guy that uh I expect big things from\nAt Miller Park this weekend he says hey you are hasn't had a great series as as well Lorenzo can hit or miss but there's a lot of upside potential for this this home series and it's it's a do or die when two games\nOr go home and spend the rest of the time thinking about what might have been so it's just been an interesting series throughout\nJust worried about friday just waiting friday then all bets are off yeah 'cause there's no Saturday if you don't win friday right mhm yeah just when friday or don't worry about Saturday at just get the games I don't\nKnow the good news is they have Miley and you asked us just seem\nSo they have their best to picture starting pitchers well rested they're both times restaurant haters ready to go if they gonna hit the ball and Miller Park has been a friendly environment for that a scenario that can get it done but uh there's a lot at stake of course two games to get to the world series I liked the fact that it's that clear cut\nThere's no a\nSecond chance as you got one or two games then you go to the world series and how how cool would that be so we spent some time and all that brewer stuff in the next hour just kinda dissecting all these different angles on the beach series the season\nAnd our quest to revisit the world series\nFor the first time since Nineteen eighty two that's all coming up after the news right here on WGM Jay\nGood morning was not in a way to be with you on this Thursday [noise] so here we are [noise] ... see I have to win two games\nSo less our and spent some time and a lot of different aspects of this uh the series some some things that just bother me about the baseball I'm\nFor going to start though and and challenge to the folks on Facebook dot com you can you can you can find us basically dot com slash six twenty WGM Jay can questions comments or going to have those there I'll Try to get to those as I can also text us our caller for one for seven nine nine one sixth one of the academic work it's talking text line\nSo a couple of things many Machado find ten thousand dollars for running in the first baseman have Susan how you are game for the CS it seems like hey Seuss amendment chowder of gotten over it because you always have some really strong pointed comments I guess I asked the question\nIs that enough\nIt's not really a fine for a guy like that it's gonna make probably what two hundred and fifty million dollars in his next contract that's like me paying fifty cents to somebody\n[laughter] but they did find him and rather quickly so clearly there is something that uh they didn't like about what happened on the field at Dodger Stadium\nBruce Springsteen didn't like it retired MLD umpire he doesn't like right now he was on channel four\nTry and hurt another individual you consider your ... it was flagrant and as an official it's your job to protect the other player\n... says he should've been thrown out here's the thing and and they're coming back to the park for hopefully a game is six and seven if he does something like that I Would not be shocked if you've got thrown out of the game\nNow he's done several things during the series he seems as Christian Yellen said to be a dirty player\nOr in fitness as we're walking brewers players that theory that uh the official or a the head of a major league baseball they should have noticed all this and said hey you're out you're out you're suspended for the rest of the the that or something like that I\nI I don't think they would do that given the gravity of the series the weight of this the fact that the Dodgers are trying to go back to the world series and thanks for the call rich but what I Do think it's going to happen if he does anything else in the six or hopefully game seven he's going to get tossed out I Would be shocked if that didn't happen because you cannot try to injure your opponents\nWhether it's sliding into second base whether it's ... you're trying to take the legs out from under fishes and you are at first base that can't happen All right we'll take more calls and tax next manual channel what should happen to this guy is he a dirty player\nMore on that story right here on WGM during the Democratic leaders if we can to state representative veil quaint got other addressing the state assembly while drunk Jerry ... Wagner any has new information on that story today at twelve ten ...\nWe're talking many Machado I have a little bit of a quotes I was reading the story about it's\nA um one of the reporters yesterday I asked him about this a discipline from the major league baseball's the ten thousand dollar sign this is what he said I'm not talking about that I'm trying to play baseball when asked me a baseball question we'll talk about interesting he doesn't want to talk about it it's it's your actions\nI'm not talking about that I'm trying to play baseball when asked me a baseball question we'll talk about it and she doesn't want to talk about it it's it's your actions\nYour conduct on the field if you're going to do it all at once you what you should have said if you believe it was there was nothing wrong there there was a baseball player I did I did when I was supposed to do he couldn't even own his own actions that's ... what kind of a person making the charter was let's go to Mike calling from Westchester, Illinois good morning Mike\nYeah I'd say my God I think we're just way too much\nAll right do you think he's a dirty player how do we lose we lose Mike\nAren't we lost Mike what am I supposed to be talking about it too much you know what I disagree with the reason I wanted to talk about it is because I think\nWe're getting to a point in this country where people including athletes don't know how to conduct themselves anymore sportsmanship out the window conduct on the field out the window\nEntitlements\nYeah he's a great baseball player one of the best in the major league baseball does that mean he doesn't have to follow the rules that that means you can try to injure other players as part of the game I don't think so let's go to David in Dallas he'll drink WGM Jay morning David\nGood morning said thanks for taking my call what do you think they are weighing in on me and my God oh you're very poor behavior I guess my I think it goes a little bit beyond I've been watching the game and the Dodgers\nAre as a whole have been very poor in terms of their conduct after striking out or after a thinking oh you know flooding around get fined we've seen a picture for all the candy and drop that I'm Lauren Frayer being\nBroken back on their way back to the dugout and quite honestly it's not a very ... like even apart aren't concerned I'm very proud of the ... the\nWay that we could talk themselves they struck out when the bases loaded they walked back to the dog out and and they conduct themselves you know and the way that we can take care of many Machado and I'm a St Louis I mean I yeah ah well while fans of Dodgers if\nThis afternoon on an online game let's wrap this thing up and let them take care of those guys it's unfortunate when you've got young children that are watching this I'm all excited about it and then you see that type of behavior going on a on national TV it's a disgrace to the doctors\nAll right thanks for the call David ... I I Will agree with you on one thing I don't I don't I'm not going to call it the other players and the Dodgers there comes a highly competitive I think that's just the way that are most athletes deal with that stuff but there's a distinct difference between vats and what many Machado is doing he's trying to injure other players through his conduct on the field and\nIf you don't think that's the case look at the plays again one of the ... uh challenges me trying to interrupt play or are you serious like every time I picture brushes are better back\nIt's not the same thing as part of baseball and things that made him a ... was doing I don't think a part of baseball let's give a joy from Milwaukee we've got about thirty seconds joy what do you think\nJoy from Milwaukee going once\nAlready know call from joy so let's just concluded with is the brewers can do it on the field Saturday hopefully a Friday Saturday as well that'll shut up many Machado\nMaybe the fans would give him a the the kind of cheers I'd say that facetiously that he observes for his conduct that'll be part of the great atmosphere that is Miller Park if you don't think this was is this was a combination of the season at least as far as trying to get to the world series this weekend is zips\nSo much at stake do or die games with a great Markey as the caller said a classy Milwaukee team but does it the right way fun stuff we aren't the cubs we aren't the\nDodgers were the Milwaukee Brewers so let's let's get a couple of weeks\nAfter the break after the news we're gonna go to ... bill steps WGM daycares initiatives raise the beam\n\nNice size I really wish you on this Thursday to for the last a couple of weeks we've been\nHighlighting ... says WGM secures initiative raised the beam and today is no different I'm Eric this was a great project ... ... are trying to build that memorial\nRight now a steel beam from the north tower of the world Trade Center rush\nOn stone on the ground in the center

their memorial\nAnd like we talked about the this memorial is more than just honoring the victims there's so much more in one of the aspects is Henri first responders the firemen and police officers the others that were involved with this in today's installment of our WGM daycares initiative presented by first big financial center\nUser looked at two survivors from our area one of them is Jessica Olson burger\nShe was from west bend actually she's very similar to the age of ... and she actually looked for ... after the attacks so we hear from Jessica\nAs this took place and we hear from Mike freak some ... who also was in the Trade Center when the attacks occurred\n\nWhen I think back on it I'm struck by what a beautiful morning it was\nAlways going to work I took the train from Brooklyn to Manhattan had my\nStarbucks in hand pop out of the subway and walk across the courtyard between the two towers\nI actually had second train very close to the world Trade Center\nShook tremendously I was not too far from the windows pretty quickly this guy was littered with the green [noise]\nIt wasn't until I got out on the street that I realized there was something really\nWrong with the lights were out there already see smoke or as people everywhere firemen already you know I'm I'm seeing him\nAlive screaming and panic\nFrom shrinking going on [noise] you had heard a plane is

panic actually in class midtown area\nTo get away from all\nTall buildings when we did finally get out there was stuck in the street on fire [noise]\nAnd um you know the police were there you know

Y. on air and we're here for you well we'll talk things through the ... when things started going wrong today was when you least shot seen\nJust didn't have it and he he he went out there and gave up a couple of runs that he he just was not sharp\nTo throw strikes in the pound is zone and do what they do that and I thought we saw that from Walker bealer\nOh yeah I mean there's no doubt about it he he worked in is breaking ball you know really well after that it it of course she gives\nYou a a a lot of confidence I mean yeah you have a cushion to work with and you know and if and if you pitch you know in a careful manner I mean the earth at some base runners they didn't have a ton but they had some base runners to work with um yeah I Believe they stranded a runner outage jacket or at least in scoring position\nOr at least five maybe six times and the game\nYou know with two outs and and um you know that's that's a credit for what he was able to do is they they didn't do much\nOnce he left the game either against that bullpen and ... a lot of stuff working early and we had earlier they only got one confident you can sense it he's going to be somebody to deal with for everybody going up against to me it's only twenty three years old\nI I look back at this last month\nAnd maybe even three weeks and you look at this team I I just I've I've said this before but I'll say it again I Love when you look at what they've accomplished\nWhere they went from being a team that was on at one point maybe the playoffs bubble and then they were able to clinch a playoff spot and then they were able to make sure that they would have been the top wild card and then they\nWere able to win the division and also come up with the best record in all the national league and then they sweep through the division series and then they get all the way to game seven of the national league championship series that's\nCorrect that's a lot to accomplish should have been less than a month\nWell yeah I mean they they basically ... you know an entire season and put themselves in a position to do a lot of great things in a really short window of time\nBut it's that window of time of the season that every player dreams about adding and dance so many contributors to filling dreams and and they really did I mean every single scene\nTending you can't help but think about September or you can't help but think about the finish and they had a heck of a finished I mean it daddy finish like we haven't seen before a even going back to eighty to\n... they were in a position to finish really strong in the final week at the regular season and uh they data three game later four games to go they lost three straight games to force or what turned out to be a tie breaker in Baltimore in the final day of the year to to advance the playoffs and\nYou know they haven't had a whole other opportunities you know in in franchise history to do those things but\nThe wrong name one on is a script that you can write but a lot of times changed cancer cell and really\nA gamble to do what they did it was unbelievable I mean last year a game away from going to the playoffs this year or a when a way to go into the world series so that's that's saying a lot one year\nI credit goes to the warm and fuzzy stuff before uh before we call tonight and\nI I just we buy and that you on all year long most of the season you were up you're doing the show with me a live and I'll tell you what there's there's there's very little things in life that I enjoy more than being able to stand alongside you and\nAnd a host shows and uh you're you're a great teammate in this in a great friend and I'm I'm Glad we've been doing this now for three years the three years of rule by pretty fast it's\nGreat I Can't wait to or the start of next season so we can be doing it once again\nWell thanks checked in the mail Matty stress in the mail my friends [laughter] you know what your your your pleasure to work with and I will say this is a new really establish herself in this market and people love you people of\nColor in the show of people appreciate your your baseball intelligence in your passion and uh that that said a lot or for who we are your your beyond a pleasure to work with in a dream to work with\nIts its top stick around the ballpark some nights when it's white but uh you and I stick it out and you especially do each night to the very end in sight off time and that's really a credit to the person you are and I can't wait to get going again at twenty and I said what the hell\nI ...

want to join us for one for seven nine nine months six twenty four ... four seven nine nine one six twenty that is the ac unit mortgage talking tax line\nWill steal here from ah Jerry August seems box sports Wisconsin and we'll also hear the posting comments a manager Craig council we'll hear from current counseled about twelve thirty right now back to the phones will go to Dave in graft in heyday gr on WGM Jay\nI'm at a uh I enjoy your show I think you and your producer along the Craig do a great job and uh so cool just you and good she's in as well um what I what I talk about your producer is I'm a I think the brewers can keep their heads up very high they didn't show\nAnd a rental kind of took some of my comments um they are playing the best of the ... that's why these are a seven game series and it could have easily win\nEither way so it's tough here a like a naval I can hear his voice um but I I don't think they um have anything to be ashamed about like like a I told your producer\nI went to more games this season than I ever have I uh bought more merchandise um they really are an exciting to watch and and I agree with the caller about Jonathan scope I don't know what happened to him but also balancing out was ...\nFor an exciting thing to watch and and I agree with the caller about Jonathan scope I don't know what happened to him but\nAlso balancing out was the post season play by our CEO and bite crash and these guys are what ... is a king mentioned they were getting better and better as the postseason went on so um it\nIt's tough not to be in the world series but I don't think they have anything to be ashamed about no real\nTechnical insight or just some comments from I\nHave I I appreciate it you know something that you said that this kind of one of the first time I've thought about just because ... Johnson skill did not have a good run with the brewers she had a couple of big hits the ... the home run against San Francisco most notably um there was another hit here another there that were\nThat were big and I think when you evaluate Johnston scope you don't evaluate him from a sense of what he did in the big picture because he did not play well the numbers were not there there's no way to sugarcoat that but you do look at the moment he had\nThat impacted this team he really helped the team win a game or two\nAnd this team needed every single when they got to get to a position where they had the best record in the national league for the game one sixty three so it's not like he made zero impact you didn't make much of an impact\nAnd it for my financial situation they have club control on scope for next year but when you look at the arbitration projections\nHe's probably in line to make better than ten million dollars next year and I'm not convinced\nThe brewers want to spend ten million dollars on them so that something may happen there especially if they can work out a deal with the stock is yeah he's got that mutual option for Fifteen\nOr what what what do you get more value out of Johnson scope Tanner my stock is Fifteen if that's an option\nI think that saying that they'll be they'll be sort of looking at but another part of the Johnson scope impact maybe not motivated Orlando Garcia I don't know but it's the trade deadline you're supposed to be the starting shortstop for the brewers when you're a land or sea you've already been sit down to triple a couple of times\nI said you've got a magnet yeah\nWell the ... well if if there's a reason that he made us depending on the amount of dirt the mall or polls up\nThere's a whole bunch of people in the never Trump category in the Republican Party are going to jump ship and if that's the case Mr Trump has gone for Democrats\nI put up a good dog and I might work so\nNot I think it's very small the never Trump present and the diminishing I\nJust don't see the ... their bones intestinal\nThat could be true but if it's not he's gone so we'll see what happened\nThat yeah what would you like it was really always those who who would you like to see the Democratic candidate\n[laughter]\nThe only one that makes any sense as Joe Biden\nMhm you know and when ... I'm In a in terms of\nAll the people who didn't vote for Hillary the last time around that voted for Trump\nMy vote for him no that's I think you're right ...\nThanks thanks for it yeah no no he was saying just as opinion I think he's right I think if in fact I think if Joe Biden or run it would have been much tighter was Titus was in terms of popular vote Hillary one although that was mostly California much they what\nDid he do he was like a she beat him by four million votes here or did it alone here you know people don't want to pick up people live in California but you know it's always been the land of fruits nuts on hunting what is that I Can't think of the expression but I'm Joe Biden would have put up a much better right so I mean you really had to go far\nHe ... he goes he yeah he goes in there\nAnd it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know his what'd you do and and you just disappear and they made it worse do we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that it was\nA wad of interrogation that a guy got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah sure they're pretty\nSure the pretty ... [laughter]\nYeah you bet yeah this wasn't a by the way I was mentioning my producer last night this wasn't a job interview thinks is going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the incredible hulk I think people even on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way he chopped them up and when they brought didn't they bring suitcases\nIt's reported it and you know how to do things body on me so I don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on\nBut this one way of played out was not good yeah thank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way how old are you I'm a twenty two I thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who would you like to see run against president I'm\nAbout to say what for the fun of it I Would love for Pocahontas throwing I think I think that was just the you know those are just be a lot of fun to watch [noise]\nYeah well I think she shot herself on the phone right now that was that when they do it then John related\nI bet you aren't related to George Washington some are what are you saying rations we're all we're all related to everybody if you go all the way back right now she's got the Indian heritage I I think she can get I think she's done you're not going to get your wish recall anything so much yeah\nThank you and I and I ... and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eyes which is eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine mark Irish filling in on red Iranian\nLooking to purchase your own trucker trailer ... financial company may be able to help with financing Eric Gifford without trial tells us about the company and the process of getting approved\nWe started back in two thousand for two thousand eight we opened our first brick and mortar office and we've been serving truckers through today with an eight plus business\nWriting a baby and we don't go by credit score we actually look at their credit profile experience in the industry stability factors so we treat them as a person not a score will look for the way to get them approved an end of their own truck especially\nBecause just starting out and getting into ... truck commercial trucks the medium duty to the class eight truck all type trailers so all types as well just not brand new equipment we specialize in just the used equipment\nGenerally an approval within twenty four forty eight hours after that depending on how fast the customer wants to move they can be in the new truck\nThan three to seven days total go to ... a G.

mean the oval office without his jacket and tie on so you and I are are in sync who's your choice did you say ready who your choice was for Democrats you don't see how long did you\nGive me that won't Joe fighting but\nWhat about that Kennedy boy that little Kennedy boy oh boy well um I don't know what he's\nSaying wait wait sounds so nice I I got a challenge you argued I you don't know this but a few years ago on national radio I said let's make a deal no more Kennedy's no more bushes and then we have over three hundred thirty million people can't we find someone whose name is not Bush or Kennedy so would you give me that the Kennedys were done [laughter]\nYou mean by it I didn't mean to you when you said you got your hobby hey watch\nYeah yeah you know a A R pay cut and why should

for ten minutes this guy's got values more values and kind of a kind of us did obviously yeah I agree\nWith that and of course we know some of the stuff that's gone on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie and I've learned on not always agree on this that if I as much as you guys who were Democrats can't stand a Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter I felt the same way about a mile but I Know I've learned\nIf he walked in the room you give credit to the office of the president United States and use than\nNot like him and I didn't I couldn't wait for him to get out of office but that's part of the respect\nNow here's the next call I ... we have time to yeah we have time let's go to a gym in Dallas Jim you're on

mark\nHey mark how are you there I'm here I'm okay a lifetime is that John Cage shake ugly if he ran for president as a Democrat and I don't know if a public and yeah\nHe did oh boy [laughter] well balanced budget and\nKnow ever going to balance a budget that should they should run against Trump or you know but ... says two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing we had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd some well you know the somebody's got to pay for that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although\nWell he would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nConserve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nI'm at ... ... who it is Nikki Haley\nI Believe she as an elected as a global perspective that I have a degree in anthropology\nAnd I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet but we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are my thoughts what do you say are\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... is amazing because the lady and surprised me\nI I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal or ambassador to the United nations really letting them having a ... a very courageous not being afraid to save like it is she's a very impressive lady I should run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I I don't have someone\nWith a very large perspective on who we are a nation and clearly we can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in the global perspective I think that's very important so thanks\nFor I guess I guess we'll let\nYou hold on one second I'm gonna ask you your ... your answer sheriff question but\nI don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nOr does he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything he's a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but the something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that we have heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor or something about that guy and rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo tell us budget I mean we we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country\nAnd we had a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nYou know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist it it was something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle you know and it's just been going on and on and on and they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt\nIs bigger the gross national product you\nKnow theoretically that's bankruptcy and where we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what a number of that spending like we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that\nAre Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to where's he going to yeah to stash stash you know came out of his staff ... he was going to personally pain so people don't know that they said that the government has no money of its own\nI thank you very much recall very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou're a national forecast for how many trucks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook will be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nSo did he really ... yeah and we've been talk also the last few nights about\nThe Senate and the house races and he may keep it is because of what he did right people may feel the way you said that hey he was courageous and he did vote for Kavanaugh so I hear I hear we are or at least I Am being unfair maybe he really felt that way would have always voted that way\nOr there was no cooperation all that kinda stuff\nWhat their other senators lie or what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever her name is ah she's in big trouble and in fact the way out is the whole ... a capital fiasco was helped the Republicans\nJust the Democrats were always be there are always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact\nIf Kavanaugh hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems\nAre in the house the house of representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nights they take back the house you're the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do\nTrying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to impeach Trump\nWith hearings with subpoena powers ah with calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun\n[noise] no I think it's going to get ugly I personally for that that happens I think that a lot of good will come out of that I promise you that\nThat would be\nCrazy I mean I I didn't leave anything for that to me I didn't really any of it it didn't die down critical that way [noise] um [noise] I mean I get a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most\nOn it I used one of the water the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got ... we had her we've got you\nKnow I was going to say they he seems like a decent guy and you as you started say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case I think they were using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president a Democrat side are Spartacus built her and I call them that because of his own name that Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it if someone didn't\nDo that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a little difficulty with\nThe horror of war who was really was it was what was he was yeah that's a loser grain\nWas so good when it came out and said uh I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do I have but that's what they are they ought to be yeah well thank you so much for the\n[noise] absolutely I'll I'll definitely call back again\nThanks so much time and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because the skies\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what it's what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I said on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nI think she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife\nBut few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns out of high profile Clinton presidents but only dampen the party's prospects of re taking control of Washington from Republicans yeah and they're worried about her throughout the midterm elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and little secret she can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party officials say I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death when it's worse than I thought\nIt was the only political figure in America that is less popular than Donald Trump stretches that that's a real testament to her Democrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary\nThat's meant to hurt Democrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think the measuring how they can have the best possible impact and have time decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think of people who've been part of our pushed to retake the house\nI just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee and the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I like the Hillary in in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she can run forever right but don't we have forever stamps forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Rocco bum knees in there and he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like if she runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine or ... the same number thirty three thirty nine mark gosh they're filling in on red eye radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have a consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nThere cleaner synthetic pickup fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and semi synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefit of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run\nThis report is the surface of shell wrote ...\nBooks with ... radio toll free at age ... he wrote a\nDish a Gigi keeping you connected toaster goes from a comfort of your guests have to find out more additional by drug duck other students from my drug conduct\nGum it's easy to guess what's inside a trunk loads of products goods packed in time in many never consider what's inside the trunk or and the men and women who keep business moving up support communities and the parents and providers or brothers or sisters\nNeighbors inside you commitment to deliver a job well done\nFor your sacrifice the person you're driving\nThank you show wrote on the engine oil works it's hard to see\nI Try and I mean you've got plenty to manage on their own that we make life easier when ... when\nThey find Jane we've gotten all you need more parking more fresh green coffee more claims how in ... in\nA pilot mine's eight track parents Everytime nine and ... twenty more than you want to have we got at the highlights ... and get them my mind that protect out targeting real time preserve salary online and why\nDid you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nTo learn how as you can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the St Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to ... dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nThere's no better place to be the right here in ... new two thousand or an F. one even asking the Supreme Court ... or ... only one Ninety nine per month\nOr buy a new two thousand eight teams or next game nearly fifty inch that starred in it in the Knight point I was a time to check out America's favorite grant\nProtect settling becomes all ethical factor rebates and discussing details\n[noise] it's a great time to check out the amazing image or a new in free on motorcycles or the award winning Wisconsin Harley Davidson and the kind of Milwaukee\nNot sure which is right for you to be experts ...

initiative is underway and a ... real status spearheading this project raised the beam\nCaught up with Eric earlier this week to talk about what's behind the effort and more importantly how you can get involved\nWe've heard some of the great vignettes and features that you put together since you I'm unveiled his project a couple of weeks ago I guess the first question I have is why this why was this unique and something that um you know really meant so much to you that you take on this challenge\nYou know I think Scott ... thanks for having me by the way I think it comes from the fact that it it impacted so many of us it changed their lives right in so many different ways and\nEvery year when we go through the anniversary process I think Mac of how I felt and how we all felt that day and just how traumatic it was in at some point we were scared right but then there was this moment of coming together in unity in the country actually had one single spot where we all were coming together\nAnd trying to become one country again right because it seems like you're always so divided and I just remember that so vividly and I love that part of this whole situation in the country coming together so when I heard about what the ...\nI just thought it was so special this idea of let's create a memorial that not only will honor those we lost an honor those that were affected by it but also teach people about what happened after that about the the love that came from it in the way the country came together I just it it seems like a perfect fit to get this part of our W teams that cares\nBefore we share the story of the harbor men's take us into this project\nWhat are we trying to do we are trying to raise the bean right what is that well it's a piece of steel right now it sits on the ground in the center of ... them in a vacant lot of grassy lot and it is a six foot long twenty two hundred piece of steel that was in the north tower of the world Trade Center and that's where ... was working\nPower of the world Trade Center and that's where ... was working that day um they were able to get their hands on this and bring it back to ... and they want to create a memorial in raising the steel is phase one source of forty thousand dollar endeavor to have this be the focal point they wanted in the air it's a strike and you can see the rendering by the way on line\nThey want it in the air pointing toward New York you can still touch it and see it and that will bring you to the center of this memorial that they're building right in the Senate you Oscar\nDe ... story and we've heard from them on the air and we talk to them many times over the last Seventeen years\nUsually around the anniversary but the as you alluded to um Mr Mrs Hofmann lose their daughter Andrea in the north tower I Know you had them in on the air when you announced this initiative for the people who haven't heard them can you tell us a little bit about them and and just your connection with them through this endeavor\nJust a remarkable family just the way they've gone through the grief process um is just unbelievable and then the number of people they met through this you might recall the restaurant papers they own papers which is an Mac one was in men one\nI'm In a lot of people know them through that but as this process has gone by they constantly talk Scott about how the community brought their arms around them about how\nIn the days after the event everyone came together the neighborhood at first then it was the school district then it was the the village of ... grew larger and larger\nThe number of people both here locally in in New York who came to their aid to help them as they've gone through this grief process\nAnd the one thing that they will always say and they said it is to us when they were in Studio here Scott was that this memorial is not necessarily just about Andrea they they're adamant about that that they don't want people to think hey we're just on her and her daughter no it's about so much more it's it's about every person who lost their lives and it's about\nThe U.S military folks who have enlisted since nine eleven because they wanted to be part of the war on terror\nAnd they lost their lives them gave the ultimate sacrifice I it's about the first responders of course they bring that up it's just a ripple effect and they're so adamant about making sure that people realize that and I think the grief process for them has been very challenging from times I spoke with Julie I'm\nAndrea sister and she said there were some dark moments getting through the grief process and one of the issues they still run into even now is that they see or hear on the radio a story where families impacted or someone\nLoses a life in a car crash and the first thing they think is that\nThe family that poor family that person who just died is related to somebody and that family is going to be changed forever and and they often think about how hard this can be so part of their grieving process is to help I ate and counsel other folks who've had if you could just ... it's a remarkable family in by doing this I think it's more than just\nHey we want to celebrate Andres life which they do it's about realizing that that day that terrible day in American history was so much larger than that\nSo forty thousand is the goal that yet but he's one of the project and it's we've been talking about you can text word B. B. E. A. M. for one for seven nine nine one six twenty academic luggage talking text line text the word being um\n[noise] but this is just phase one and and it's more than ... as I've heard you talk there is also an educational element to a lot of this it's more than just I Want to say simply a memorial to yeah what happened on nine eleven but there there's bigger plans down the line yeah if money is raised initially\nIt's pretty neat they want to build an amphitheater which would have rose where people can sit and they want to have speakers they want people like Julie to calm me they want some of the survivors to come and speak to classes or the groups that are interested in coming there it's it's really close to the ... high school which is where Andrea wins\nAnd they already have kids walk from the elementary school and do like little walking field trips to that to see the steel now they want to make that more almost part of the curriculum about learning about what happened that day they're going to have some educational kiosks\nYou know I think three to be exact that will kind of describe different things you learned about the war on terror you learned about the first responders even the ones that worked in ground zero who are now losing their lives because of some of the after effects of spending so much time there\nIs a U.S military component they hope is going to be very big and that's maybe fees for of this project so it's very large there is a lot to do and what we're hoping for really just face when we would want to raise it means we're going to get that'd be up in

Morris is for mark fierce or with Brian and David our guys let's just do it I always loved the way you bring in real life\nSituations actual cases that you deal with on a daily or weekly basis bring it to the show Sunday helps me relate I Know it helps to listeners relate to you bet\nYou bet and so uh this is not an uncommon story you know when parents want to help their children by our home and this particular case\nThe um child as an adult and you know Thirty years old and I'm moving back to the Milwaukee area\nUh and and so the the parents want to help out and the question sort of this person doesn't have a job yet right\nAnd of course in moving back to the person moving back the thirty year old parents do the parents have great shots and plenty of income and an downpayment money as well and and so interestingly enough thing number one is if we were to put\nThe daughter on the lawn and on the title to the home we could do this as an owner occupied purchase with as little as five percent down yes oh actually three percent because she's the first time over\nYeah even though she has no income so does that blow your mind Scott yeah as long as the parents co signed a for the daughter ... doesn't have to have any income\nEven with no income guys will get a name on there yeah yeah well and we get to price it as a\nPrimary residence or the parents' income is strong enough to carry two mortgages and that is absolutely correct and um and so just by the way the payment on that scenario so that was actually the third sorry that are wrong ran at\nA hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and and the parents are willing to let's say invest total money out of pocket of thirty thousand\nUh we get a monthly payment assuming something for taxes blah blah blah of uh eleven hundred and sixty five dollars for a number that just under twelve hundred bucks if it's on her occupied\nWe haven't checked the daughters credit yet and uh you know so that'll come into play but so this one interesting thing but then as thinking about this and talking to our repeat customer who called me up personally as happy to talk to him\nI said well you know you can buy a single family home as a rental property as little as Fifteen Percent down\nWell at that uh the payment is\nA hundred and one dollars higher it's twelve hundred and sixty five hundred sixty six bucks what's a hundred plus called a hundred and two bucks higher per month why would you want to do that David any guesses I already know the answer to the U.S write\nThe answer is that if you call something a rental property and as long as you are charging fair market rent now let me say this way I think I haven't talked to ... and Paul about this least check with your ... your ...\nBut I think you don't actually have to collect the money as long as you report that you've got fair market rent on the top line of schedule you wear your reporting your rental income uh then not only do you get to be ducked the mortgage interest the property taxes and the utilities and maintenance that you pay but you also get to deduct this phantom\nThing called deep ... so you get to in this case and it was nothing but a paper last paper was where you say I'm get to pretend that this house was going down and do you buy one twenty seventh per year\nIt was going down and do you buy one twenty seventh per year\nWhich in this case will be sixty two hundred bucks so basically you could shoulders income as a rental property\nAnd ended up having to report no income\nCool because I think all those deductions would add up to more than the fair market rent you might even be able to get a little loss on this and then I started thinking because we have this customers we sat there and his ah two thousand Seventeen tax returns cheers a specific example of somebody who has for time in memorial\nUm itemized his tax deductions on his personal tax returns and that occurs on schedule a as in apple and last year she had a thirty one thousand dollars of totally dachshunds but I looked at that and I said oh guess what\nA next year because of the new tax law [noise]\nYour property taxes and state income taxes are going to be kept at ten ten thousand so you'd only have like twenty two thousand dollars or deductions and the standard deduction extras twenty four\nAll right so so I get to other scenarios for you and how we can skim this cat will cover those when we come back\n[noise] sounds like a plan you're listening to the accurate mortgage unreal do show on this Sunday Morning on WGM Jay\nFlicking when you actually

on WGM Jay right now of course you're listening to the academic mortgage and real t._v. show along with Brian and David quicker\nYep as September Nineteen Ninety nine little ac unit\nMortgage was uh ten minutes old two months old to ... we may have been on track to close our first mortgage just about done OK\nOkay a enriched by the way we're a lot higher than they are now All right so we're talking about the this is a nice parents trying to help their\nA daughter moving back to the Milwaukee buy a home and we said hey we could help her do it\nEven if she doesn't have a job as long as she has decent credit if she has excellent credit um we can help or buy a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollar home the current rate with no points and very well closing costs is four point nine nine percent that's six hundred and eighty dollars total on costs in her particular case and the PR is a pure thank you David\nIs a five point zero nine percent yes I was doing a scenario would be Fifteen Percent\nDown because of the amount of money the parents want to invest in this project\nAnd the pain of eleven hundred sixty five dollars well she could the other alternatives to buy it as a single family investment property that's Fifteen Percent down as the minimum the rate is sounds terrible five point eight seven five EA PR is an amazing six point two six again because at Fifteen Percent down there'd be a thin layer of\nP. M. I. P. M. I. on a monthly basis by was only forty two bucks as an investment property and twenty three dollars as a month as a single families are very very cheap if ah and and so the bottom line that comes out in that comparison well\nYou know the advantage of going with the investment property as you can you have more right off the parents didn't have all the depreciation when they go appreciation I should say when they go to ... [noise]\nUm and then the other alternative though that Israel there's well maybe you want to buy a duplex well if you buy a duplex as an investment property\nThen you have to have a lot more down sort of by that same a hundred and Seventy five thousand are probably oh now see duplex and I'm On a car rental property will now instead of shelling out thirty thousand you've gotta have twenty five percent down with all your other closing costs now you're writing a check for forty seven thousand dollars or half that doesn't seem practical\nThen the other scenario that he sent them this morning was well you know if we go on occupied we can skinny up the down payment and you could to help your daughter by a two hundred thousand so you know the question is then well how much better property or neighbor who do I get a two hundred versus one Seventy five a year\nAnd a that pain that would be about two hundred bucks more than if they bought the hundred and Seventy five thousand dollar property it'd be about Thirteen fifty and we can do the same amount of money out of pocket of thirty thousand so\nBridge loan is getting the proceeds from the sale of your home earlier right by using\nYou have to have equity in your home above the Russians say\nAnd bridge loan will only go up to eighty percent of the value of your home right so we can't lend you a hundred percent of the value of your all we can help you borrow eighty percent of the value of your home as well as a ... a lot of their exactly and so you can use those funds then for making a down payment on the next home\nWe do have to prove your ability to hold on to both homes for the snapshot in time correct but for these folks they're selling their first home and wound up to an excellent and the first one hasn't sold yet yeah\nWell we're not going to slow them down and getting into their new home and of course that there's two things for the homebuyer makes your offer more attractive because even if the market is not as robust as it was a week or a month or three months ago\nSo are still don't like to get offers that say oh it's subject to me suddenly my home grad okay that's always a downer\nAnd and and the reason is because now that side of my control and just by the way when you write one of those operations contingent on the stand your home get ready to be bumped neither\nThe the sellers not going to let you sit there and and a puppy guard that you know that home show he's going to say hey if I get a better offer I can bump you and then you have Seventy two hours typically to\nSatisfy your contingency is you just can't wait for you to prove that he can afford a British on or that you haven't accepted our furniture and clothes [noise]\nAll right so uh when we come back after this next break a let's talk about your condo sure we got a text yesterday\nAnd a phone call from our real estate agent I was on my way a way of somewhere and I couldn't help out so I texted David and said this real estate

... and Jonathan get here that's where we start where did you grow up in\nCleveland, Ohio I'm so Eighteen years in Cleveland, Ohio and a lot of people in Milwaukee now know that because I I like to bring up my ... my Cleveland Brown eyes share them alone [laughter] and and I get 'em pretty offended when people um\nAnd and I get 'em pretty offended when people um you know take 'em you know some people you know big time Packer fans will ... or be like go\nUm you know on our phones that use the costs you know just five ten years ago you know five ten thousand dollars and and that technology kids are growing up with that in their hands and and went to using moving images on social media and the Web and Snapchat you know that\nThey're communicating and I'm moving image language however rudimentary it is that to me is is a great sign for the future of movie making\n'em now the industry has to figure out how to monetize it and and there's\nYou know frankly pretty big struggles with that right now but I think viewership is up I think more people are making films and I think there's more great films then there were in the past so yes\nSo you don't get what you have all these people who like you said have these cameras now in their pocket they can also consume with that same device so they can watch whatever is made or watch whatever's created even in Hollywood or wherever it might be on this tiny little screen\nWhether Netflix or whatever it is does that hurt the cause we see such beautiful film on these giant screen like the one of the oriental ... but then you have people watching it on a three by five or ... even smaller monitor\nI tend to be a bit of a ... on their end up here is I thought you might have been sort of like viewing it as it was intended to be viewed by the artists\nHowever I I've become more lenient in to\nYou know I just want people watching movies and watching a interesting cinema and however they do that and they find comfortable to do that is a positive now does that rough place\nOr does that translate to you know a proper viewing environment for cinema as the artist intended absolutely not but I think there's a place for it and are\nIncredibly fast moving society um I just want to ensure that both our current um audience and future generations understand the power you know a cinema in that viewing environment and frankly that's one of the reasons we\nInvest so heavily and education screenings that we do with local schoolchildren so will this year bus and\nYou know around nine thousand students through the course of the festival to private school group screenings and that goes as early as first grade um all the way through high school in part of that is to to to show children that you know it doesn't\nHave to be just a a blockbuster film that there's a crowded theater but that you know there's power in that community viewing setting and and being in a place like the oriental theater\nBut you know I think we're gonna have to sort of force feed all a little bit future generations because\nI don't think it's a natural habit anymore coming up next on WGM Jay conversations what is the character of it what is the story telling what program might fit in in the festival why might resonate in Milwaukee who has the time to watch all those movies [noise]\nThink\nAt breakfast academy we prepare your children

conversations welcome back yard built that chatting with Jonathan jak than he is the Milwaukee film artistic and executive director we're talking about the festival and how you\nChoose so many different movies to screen out as Jonathan go through that how do you pick which movies are going to be used to I don't I'm not because I assume you get inundated I assume they come I don't know if it's a DVD or if it's something larger or smaller is all\nOn line now I'm nine Ninety nine percent of it has shifted in the last three four years to its all\nPassword protected sure links uh when you watch it every ... every phone work history I personally do not um before I had I now I have two young children\nAnd Milwaukee film is grown quite a bit and I in addition to uh some of the programming an artistic leadership I I Am an executive director so the demands on my time are are pulled in a lot of direct and I can't just sit in front of my\nTV screen watching movies as much as I used to live five years ago yeah I saw Ninety nine percent of the movies would you take notes would you I takes minimal notes I like to actually just immerse myself in in what's on screen try to get lost by I don't understand what the filmmakers doing or\nJust immerse myself in this story\nUm and you know typically all connected the online device into a TV and watch it that way you know and that's if I'm not out of the film festival where you know myself and our programmers we'll see you know five six films a day for you know as long as the festival is I mean you\nHave to file you like and we have a system for filing ratings\nAnd the different questions we asked to to try to trigger people to talk about not jets is that a good film do we want to show it but what is the character of it what is the story telling what program might fit in in the festival why might have resonate in Milwaukee\nUm because you know there are just so many great films out there today it's not a scientific process anymore and especially if you're watching six movies a day you have to take notes and and good notes\nUm today I don't watch as as much as I used to I I've probably seen thirty to forty percent of the festival um this year so I'm actually very excited to be able to feel out of it in the cinema we've had over twenty people involved in the programming\nProcess this year I'm and fitting in one of our Fifteen different program tracks where the festival so it's a really diverse set of voices that now select the movies and I think it's so rich or film festival because of that 'cause it's not just Jonathan's picks anymore so the\nFilmmaker alliance which is an aspect of Milwaukee film and this is correct me if I'm wrong and\nThe aspect of Milwaukee film and this is correct me if I'm wrong an idea to help cultivate create grows the idea of local film\nYes and the industry at large and you know the distinction between Milwaukee film is Milwaukee film is always supported the filmmakers at screens in the festival but this new organization that we launch is supporting all forms of filmmaking\nAnd he's advocating for it as a really important economic cluster in Milwaukee and and the difference there is that just as important to the Milwaukee filmmaker alliances is the filmmaker who screens in the first of all as the filmmaker who makes a corporate video for one\nOf our major corporations in Milwaukee or somebody at an advertising agency making content for the Web channel of a company as\nAh absolutely and you know one of the things we're doing this year as we have several new program in the festival is actually a\nTeen different sections in the festival where you can find a contact and be mad at movies you have the local section creams they send them out you have a the music factions pound vision of music documentaries that new\nThis year a one program might highlight is team screen so this was a new program brand new and the festival and this is a section that teens in Milwaukee actually had\nThe films that are showing unless they're all we had a group come together this summer watched several possible movies we were considering for the festival and they picked or that they wanted to feature in the festival and so these are our movies not just for teams but for teams I'm at all\nAnd one of the favorites of this is a documentary called personal statement and personal statement is about a high school kid then a group of high school kids to coach and work with other students to write their personal statement for their college essays\nIt's a really awe inspiring eye opening film and really encourage adults and youth to check out the screen and the twenty eighth team from basketball\nYou mentioned the oriental food or this is the first year were you guys really have full control of this theater what does that mean\nIt secures us I mean truly are the oriental either it Ninety One years old now\nA it's an architectural icon in Milwaukee I think that's one of the most beautiful here and the country or if not the world and you know this is a way for us to interact with the community three hundred and sixty five days a year\nBut it also gives us that new control any arts organization a struggle with you know where it's primary venue as then it's just a such an honor to be house within the oriental theater plus\nYou know historically we were only on the screen that the oriental eater and now we're actually on all three which will just create even more laws\nAnd excitement as a as the hub for the film festival\nWhat was the future be within Oregon we hear or get Newsweek again if the oriental some day\n[laughter] we absolutely will where are\nYou know we all have an announcement during the film festival this year but we're very excited and are in the process of securing and Oregon that I'm even more excited about that and the previous one that was house within the eater ah that ah the previous one was not actually original to the theater\nAnd what we think we'd have our hands on and are about to announce is in Oregon that uh is actually a ridge at all to the theater\nWhen that can happen you know you know I had to leave something out there for people to be decided about an hour or so you know I Can't quite break that one today\nDuring a good member no studios was unveiled recently John Ridley of course the Milwaukee native the screenwriter the Oscar winner was part of that or we had one of our folks you admit near with there to to rid\nExciting to know studios in Milwaukee you guys play a role in that explain how you are connected to this new development\nYeah so no studios is a separate business from Milwaukee failed about what we are is an anchor tenant for the space\nAt forty thousand square foot building and the old\nA half a brewery a complex and this is a creative\nArt ... or Milwaukee or they unveiled the first floor of the building this past weekend\nI have some really exciting programming or this weekend that next week and a half the space of a famous faces oil in town for it but the goal for no studios is to be a great art I'm\nFor Milwaukee and we're just excited to help it named bullet I being an anchor tenant and we'll also do some programming there year round as a we aspired to bolt connect Milwaukee and to be out of the world\nAnd use the this is a fantastic opportunity especially since you just said how many local directors local producers local filmmakers are in this very this is only going to answer that I'm an Egyptian\nAnd what's exciting is that um our initiative the Milwaukee filmmaker alliance which is a sexually a Trade Organization or growing\nThe film industry in Milwaukee you know we did a study a a year ago that looked at how many people are employed in the film industry and\nA bus that mentality region around Milwaukee I'm this isn't just a creative independent filmmakers are the festival of these are people who work at\nA Harley Davidson and our northwestern mutual or anywhere making moving image content cheese salad brand to tell a social media story to make a commercial well this industry is actually employs more people than the average a bottle in\nIndustry in Milwaukee so [noise] uh Fifteen thousand jobs but the film industry today this is a large growing factor of employment in Milwaukee and we're happy to help further with no Milwaukee filmmaker alliance and an activity as space flight no studios it's just an expert there that any\nA further so you know just in some rain or five times bigger than here that's what I like to say [laughter]\nWell it's amazing that you if you think about it everyone's like oh well there's only so much story telling you can do and we re re boots you whenever franchises whatever maybe but with a social media being the way that it is\nYou're right everything we look at some type of moving picture nowadays whether it's in their hand or on TV or on the big screen so there are so many opportunities big or small\nAnd that's the key is the end you're an art and you know people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is out there on the line in his image based and kids today you even adult\nEverybody is using their phones and telling short little film with them and so the technology is accessible to make moving images now and to make short films that make commercials and the story you can put on video and\nWe're all learning how to do that and as we as a community grow you know I really hope we invested in that respect there because\nThere's a huge potential for employment and for really telling the story of Milwaukee more broadly\nComing up next on WGM Jay conversations when you put a VR device on you really shut

on your home for Packers football since Nineteen twenty nine WGM Jay\nWe welcome you to limbo feeling Green Bay Packers previews we knew our pre game programming and it's great to have you with us we got some light rain here at land ball field already McCarron that field\nFunny I talked to ... long well this morning the kicker for the Packers that he mentioned that this field is fine at a deluge but when we have a light rain is when it gets a little bit slick and so we'll keep an eye on that today\nOr certainly that was a situation way back for that pre season scrimmage when these slipping problems began hopefully that will not be a problem this afternoon\nLarry let's take a look at this rate are often to give the Green Bay defence to start with your writers last year were Eighteenth overall on up and they have some question marks on all bent rich Gannon takes over he's the former biking quarterback experience quarterback athletic and probably a pretty good fit for with what John route and likes to do which is a west coast style of all\nKinds of last year they had jumped George who's a home run type guy the west coast often it's more of a ball control office and rich Gannon certainly more of a ball control guiding her job George\nThe readers are capable of going to be able to pass a game though you've got an accomplished receiver in Tim brown their all time leading receiver and then you've got a guy was tremendous world class speed and James Jen how do you defense that\nHopefully well\nI have to answer that I think the Packers were through youngsters and so of course\nThe biggest cheaper them defensively as having everybody on the same page going to the right spot being in the right spot on the field depending on their coverage called I think if they can do that and give themselves a chance to compete he'll do fine ass when we get mental mistakes or people are running for you that they're going to have to travel and\nYou don't do that and I think they're all very sharp are so important the free safety the secondary like this Larry his show for it to get people on the same page\nHe's the quarterback that makes all the calls makes a lot of adjustments and there are just in his third year but he's got to grow up in a hurry they really need a great point\nYou know I tell you something of the things we've all been concerned about this summer is putting pressure on the quarterback and I think that rate rose and company are going are looking forward to scheming now that we're into the regular season to get some of that pressure don't you\nKnow certainly the defensive teams for the Green Bay Packers that we saw in training camp day to day was not the one we saw in pre season games they kept a lot of things save the New Orleans saints preseason game a lot of things under wraps didn't bring extra folks I think when you see some of that\nToday All right and you talk with Mike McKenzie who will get a scarred here today you're talking
