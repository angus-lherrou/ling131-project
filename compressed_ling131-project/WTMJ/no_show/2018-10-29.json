map to this is Packers team presented by hello windows and doors of Wisconsin\nTo be joined by mark ... and taking your calls for one for seven nine one six twenty until nine o'clock let's get on the clock here and grab a phone call or two we've got David in Plymouth joining us and Packers or to you had to\nWrite my question is um what I commend the Packers for the tremendous job they did on op ed today by I don't understand why we do to three headed\nRunning back when I mean I think I'm On I'm Ruth I'm Out I think Aaron John tremendous job back there and see what you think and hang up and I met her\nName for the phone call David very clear today mark that Aaron Jones a while he wasn't I don't know if he was if you want to say featured twelve Perry's I don't know how much of a feature job that is\nBut if he hasn't done enough to endear himself to the coaching staff as the guy who deserves not only the bulk of the carries but you know three series to every one I'm not sure what else he needs to do um [noise]\nBut in the case of time of gum read with what happened today\nAnd I just kind of look at her out on Twitter it it it seems that according to Mike mccarthy the plan was for time of Germany to taking me in the end zone instead of taking the ball out and you seemed brother loose with the ball and then it got poke free ultimately ending the Packers day right there on the field\nI mean how do you how do you view this one right because if coaches are saying you've got to pick an e taking the call and the coach into the fold the player to me it seems like this one falls on the player for making the wrong decision\nWell I mean if the coach tells you stay in the end zone and if you remember I don't know how many years ago this was already but the Packers are playing the giants up in ... in New York\nAnd the same scenario basically played out it was a little less time but they took a knee and then they talked about why they took need obviously given more time to air and they go down drive down the field Mason takes the game when he feel go against the giant\nKind of thought that would be the case tonight when you start factoring into two minute warning and the fact that if you meal on the football you're going to get a flavor for the two minute warning plus you still have the time out a it's an inexcusable air uh\nYou always look at the players are the ones that have to make these decisions in real time you have to take that if you're really really feel strongly about it\nYou don't have a back there and you make sure you're adamant in saying you're not bringing this ... there's no grey area and you do that but it always comes back to the players and the players will do what they're coached in what they're taught\nAnd they always run through these scenarios in training camp you you make sure that your situation of football is sound and obviously the night that wasn't the case with a guy in a contract\nEarmark and Simon cameras in a contract year's this the kind of thing that could end his career in Green Bay\n\nYou know I don't I don't know if I'd go that far I think anytime you have a critical or I mean just look at what happened was granted Bostic the it was an immediate cut I think the season ended and that was okay you're a ... it's it and there's these moments that will always stick with you as a player but you\nFeel like it's time I ... is a valuable contributor and I still think he is I think out of the backfield he is a a running back they can do a lot of things that you love the passing\nGame he's a matchup guy he has a lot of different skills\nThis is a mistake this is something that he is going to that flight back is going to stink\nI you anytime you feel like you cost your football team an opportunity to win a game it hurts but to just to say no he's gone\nI think that will be more about what the finances look like and what path you feel like going forward you're going to do with that running back room and if you're gonna end up going with someone else is your third down back then but I think right now you still would look at ... somebody really valuable and you're passing\nIt also keep in mind that trade deadline there's just a few days away here in the NFL as the new GM running the show in Green Bay will be very curious to see how this week plays out\nFor the Packers inability to finish the first half and at the end of the game if if the Packers and the bus today a lot of good things to talk about as well we'll dive through it all coming up on the other side Packers team

up a trip out east to face the patriots a week from tonight I'm right now that's a key part of this has Packers or tea presented by fellow windows and doors of Wisconsin Mike McCarthy's not wanting to throw guys under the bus tells you play for him I think players probably appreciate that\nBut behind closed doors just health fuming mad you see at the way the game ended\nOh he's going to be disappointed and I think\nYou know when you're a coach your your it does you know good\nTo publicly chastised guys you know you you seen that with any lazy he did that after the playoff game\nI don't know that was I think that's something he wishes he hadn't done in this case he's gonna pointed out you're going to be in your position room you know that every time I've ever knows that he he screwed up and it wasn't so much that he brought the ball out that was a mistake it was following the football that was the bigger mistake\nFrom coaches standpoint you look at it and you say how can I not\nHave this happen again you have to make sure these points in these situations\nAre hounded into the guy's head's they understand them they know them like second nature so\nYou don't get excited and think oh I can make a big play here and try to get our team in a position to when when you just do your job and you hear bill ... talked about but I Do your job\nAnd that's something that I think Mike as always done he's you know understand your role make sure that those roles are as crystal clear to you as you possibly can make sure that you're executing them the the best of your abilities and if the coach's job to put you in the best position to be successful\nThis is a case where it's not just one person you you can blame it on time I'd Henri but from a country standpoint you see on the winter I see you know all over the place already you know he should go this guy should go to work through this stuff you can't have these mistakes continually happen and eventually the stuff always comes to roost\nBut right now I think Mike mccarthy there's there's I don't know if he comes out in his\nYou know just ... what good is that going to do that can do any good\nIf he divided coaches orders I think that's a problem right in in in its address some way some way shape or form whether it's a reduction in plain time whether it's a tree and who knows right but ... define coaches orders that never goes over well in in and get some kind of reading between the tea leaves your I did not hear Michael Curtis comments\nBut it seems like the plan was to stay in the end zone the corporate McCarthy the plan there is to stay in the end zone so that's not communicate it to the return man that's the problem was coaching if that has been communicated to the return man that's on the player is that simple enough to look at it that way\nYeah there's no doubt I think you know coaches have scenarios they have a you know they have a lot of people giving them information as to what the best scenario isn't as I mentioned earlier the fact that\nYou've had time on the other side of the two minute warning so if you want to run a play or you want to run the football and that kind of get where you're in a second in normal rather than drop back and passed right away you have all those things at your disposal if the coach's job to make sure that the players understand what their role is and it's a fair adamant about something\nIt yeah it's as easy as doing the coin toss you don't wear the coaches will tell you this is the end zone we want to defend we want to defer it could be that simple but then you have to make sure you're reminding guys\nSaying hey if it's in the end zone Milan we want to get the ball and Aaron Rodgers hands or you don't even have to just say Neal on the football and if that was illustrated to him than if you're buying what the coaches asked\nIf it's more along the lines of just going out doing you're normal thing\nSometimes you return to kick sometimes you don't ... I think if you really want to mention try to place blame which does really nobody any good that's what you would try to get through and I my guess is it it's probably it was probably ... to him at some point whether or not it was adamantly done I think that would be the interesting parts of figure out\nBrennan is in Green Bay joining us they had run and things were holding\nI Know from thanks for having me so I think obviously we're going to be thinking about this time on camera on the number one However I'm just want to ask again what do you think about the play oh at the end of the second half their wherever I'm half inch yard line by\nUm our very own stamps you you\nYou know obviously hindsight's twenty twenty you think you know you wouldn't want for your yard where you wouldn't be talking about it but obviously we got stuff uh we had a safety and then a quick fix our right down the field there after the ... so do you think that that was the right like Ninety percent of the time we stick with Iran or do you think that that was something that we absolutely need to pass out quickly\nYeah appreciate the phone call tell us I I'll ask you as a as an office of climate because that seems to be one of those key you got to win the battle in the trenches to try and move yourself just an answer I just give a little breathing room right so does that come down to the Princeton\nBreathing room right so how does that come down to the trenches or does it come down to the back that was on the field or play call in general how do you view that\nWell I mean obviously it wasn't the right call because it was the ... your ... your base you're judged on your results and what you want to do is have\nEverybody practices that scenario you're ... you're backed up and you'll have a certain amount of plays a lot of times you do a quarterback sneaker you'll do fall back dive just to\nKind of give a little bit of room to try to operate because you don't want to have where if somebody gets beat you're going to have a safety so the point wasn't executed while it was a combination block of one of the lime and didn't get off on his block the linebacker shot the gap in that dynamic and she was able to get back there\nAnd they were able to make a play that happens unfortunately you have to guard against that\nWhen you're down in that zone because you don't want to give up points so it's not like a normal person tan and you're sitting at second eleven second as well\nThis one really hurt so\nYou have to stick with what your plan is you have to have kind of something that you lean on whether that's a power play or if it's a fallback dive or if you spread it out and want to just you know throw the ball up quicker than the Adams and get a little bit of room you have to kind of know what you're good at and focus on that and obviously in this instance that that did not have\nI get all that it's always well All right if you're going to make a decision like that who are you going to put factor that's going to improve the football team and that's where you know that trucker Davis a activation and how that's going to play out that this will be a storyline to watch

went to a trove because Rogers is current place\nAnd it really offended me when he he went off for like ... he went off and say here's a highly successful coach highly successful coaches were when you were\nAnd I think what's happening now is also the Packer that gets the organization's fault for being complacent I think they got a happy ... playoff appears there are focused on winning Super Bowl\nAnd the problem with that is my record is classic case of coordinate management they shouldn't be doing better than I I'd like to hear a ...\nI mean look overall I agree and I just I I don't I don't want to speculate about coaches future but I think it is going to be very difficult for Mike mccarthy here if this team especially if the Packers do not reach the playoffs\nThat's not going to be good for its future but even if they're in based off a sweeping changes we saw last off season and some of the comments that you heard\nAbout the expectations for this team it feels like it can't just be the Packers get into the playoffs and lose the opening weekend or losing division around they got to go deep in the playoffs now\nWhat you touched on in the expectations for this team and chase scene championships in becoming complacent I agree and I don't think you can really denied the team became complacent with knowing as long as we have this group in place\nWill win nine to ten games is assuming Aaron Rodgers is healthy when nine to ten games maybe eleven getting the playoffs get to the division around the stretch where they were basically get into the NFC championship game every other every third year will do that\nBut that's probably it\nLook when you're the decision maker that is a difficult spot to say this isn't good enough\nBecause if you go on and make a change it could get worse\nSo that is why we've seen it stay status quo for so long but I think something big has to happen this year and as we just outlined with that schedule with the way the NFC looks now\nOne thing that could go against that as we see the seats are up to scores on the Vikings right now since the Viking blues there for three and one the bears are foreign three and your three three and one\n\nSo maybe the NFC North is not as good as we thought it was\nBut something major has to happen this year if it just stays the same if this team this is the playoffs or if they somehow get

I've got a bar lovely a four thousand dollars and have invested those and to um like I said the unknowns thought\nAll right let's say let's just say we have a a real serious decline in the market and four thousand two years from now is worth only two\nAnd you're going to owe the four thousand are you going to hate yourself for you and say oh well it's okay I knew what I was risking and I'm willing to cough up the two thousand as I'm going to have to\n[noise] um I'm I'm thinking that as the years progress that they would be a good idea for me to kind of started saving a for a case something does happen and by the end of that um that that program\nAll right so let me tell you the way I always look at this and that's what's the worst case scenario where the worst that can happen is am I prepared for that if you psychologically um and practically\nHave a strategy that if the market does not do well\nThere you can handle the borrowing you're doing because in the scheme of life it's not an enormous amount of money you're talking about borrowing for stocks even though borrowing to buy stocks always makes me nervous if you've really thought through that and how much risk you're willing to take\nGo for it you'll learn more about stock investing by doing that\nBut I Would not treated as a lifelong practice borrowing money to buy stocks known as margin I find that to be a very risky thing\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n\nAn official methods for Medicare open enrollment ends than so now's the time to reopen mind [noise] look at everything\nPrescription drug plans on Medicare Advantage plans that insurers fly because crime strange soak in your health I found a lower cost extra benefits aren't saved money open to something better Medicare DACA will call one eight hundred Medicare today from them on their own to somebody [laughter] [noise]\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services [noise]\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners are less sees can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective take on it airbags in their vehicles\nTo see if you're a vehicle is included and to file a claim to the auto airbags settlement dot com or call one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com for one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people ask\nMe how to keep competing at the age of Seventeen healthy living is important but so it fame [noise] if you have ... you can't train someone throws I discovered salon ... plus this unique topical\nSo it's painless if you have paint you can't train sewing throws I discovered salon ... plus this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for salon pasta ... cream or wrong\n[noise] here's the\nCold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is the second Brian hard water contains harsh mineral that can try out in in here hard wired ...

and share with you\nYou know how I'm most\nPeople now are doing their bank deposits on their phones you have the ... from whatever financial institution here where the credit union bank brokerage whatever and you take an electronic imaging years check your depositing and deposited into your account I had no idea\nThat there were people who were depositing and one account and then going to cash that same checked somewhere else\nAnd sticking losses through the banking system well now there's new guidance issued by the Federal Reserve who get stuck with the last second time somebody presents a check it's not who wrote the check\nIs on the second financial institution you go to the ... the ... it's the one that you deposit check with electronically according to kept minors\nSo there's a new federal procedure guidelines issued\nOn who will be liable in the future based on what you're required to do do not be surprised\nIf in the next few weeks you get a notification from your bank credit union brokerage whoever it is you do electronic deposit with there will be appraised they require you right on the face of the check you're going to deposit\nAnd that will be something white for mobile deposit only or something of similar wording that the bank is requiring and that is\nWhat you'll have to put on both for your deposit will be accepted the idea of being that will lemonade you trying to deposit fat check the second time somewhere else knew people would try to run a game like that anyway [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nHey romantic here for a holiday automotive and find a way they automate perfect timing to upgrade vehicle during holidays on sale get more trucks or SUV for your buck with rate offers on every new several eight GMC ripe holiday and score up to Twenty one percent below MS RPG\nLike you can make a case from the government's point of view to Cold War speech if they were the public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects\nBut it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their prices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably win the Citizens United environment where the oil\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government isn't the way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate guess what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors\nBut this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold die I Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to hearing what ails me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from positions is that we're the problem more than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing delve into research because they know what's affective they don't need to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a significant number to make it\nDefensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underlined disappoint Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs in it off\nAnd New Zealand and that's it every other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained a licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end of his practice because they say this just inflating drug prices and hearing people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it match what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum we're not that powerful sorry\nCan't change that momentum so we've got to drill\nWe can't change that momentum so we've got to travel back to basics and that is the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need any more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with the idea that well there's a generic or there's an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers\nAnd all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person and I would also encourage people to wait till the elected representatives because if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again curing ailments as opposed to moving product\nGetting rid of the direct to consumer ads it'd be a big\nStep in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what Amy is what all watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter] was gosh\nI Can't get past you have a new explain that to your side anyway the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nThey have all that money going to the ads and so don't let them change your mind don't want those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIt is that going to pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are on imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus from Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son what he Diaz says family radio\nWell I Would say that things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOkay\nCorey with us on the car coward show oh Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [noise] Corey you've got something that happened\nIn your life it's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately a those after my wife has a language that that's the way\nWell I'm very sorry about her loss\nHello thank you\nHow can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while it kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money\nWhat where everything's set out as far as our coverage so all we are going to be adding a a six sixteen Seventeen year old son on to the cause do within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I\nJust add your wallet just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot 'cause that's what happens\nWhen you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes yeah we're lucky enough so that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny other cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a collision comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that my wife but that was one of the first thoughts along with a ways to duck doubles\nYeah I'm a baseball fan and raising the doctor balls okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to okay but that helps and you\nWere five hundred now so\nYeah it's a raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway yeah because the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nAll our oldest vehicle is it's ... for\nYou only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay I thought I was thinking the other two are new or the other two thousand Fifteen and take the car we just got his two thousandth ... so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the ... for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the bar but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most time for sure\nSo as you in this case there may be an advantage in talking with an independent agent\nOkay or you know something people really don't do any more but there are agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older 'cause a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations I'd done with new drivers with teenagers what's going to be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rates tend to be set in a state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle no more and be on a separate policy and then and other places it may be better for him to only be named in additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and sort of agent will not be able to quote those but they'll have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nSkiles was season there's the industrial or what does this the other sort of light bulbs this new book is

advantage of a shift in the marketplace\nAnd speaking of a shift in the marketplace\nCard companies are having a really hard time acquiring new customers\nThey have really spent themselves into

patterns and what you use\nAnd you'll get a new one so\nCredit card companies know one of the things that hold you back is your concern about having a heart inquiry on your credit especially if you're declined for whatever it is you've applied for so\nFor whatever it is you've applied for so the credit karma people that have gotten to be a huge force\nPaid a charge you higher rates because you've shown yourself to be so extremely loyal and they know that a certain percent of their customers tend not to comparison shop tend to just remain intensely oil and so your reward for that is higher rates\nUh-huh\nSo you're finding a significant difference and what they quote you and what others are quoting you that's why they're charging you above general market rates what kind of difference have you found so far\nOh not a not a huge amount I ah like ours held are and not so I'm hearing a lot of the coverage on it um you know like God is for every six months probably a couple of hundred dollars\nWell you know a couple of hundred is less than I Would expect you to tell me is the difference\nI and uh make sure the coverage is you're getting quoted are the same and they you can make a

a moment [noise]\nThere's a new report out in the journal of the American Medical Association that a large number of dietary supplements that were subject to recall last year are still being sold on store shelves\nAnd still being sold on the Internet these items are extremely dangerous and ah in fact the wording in the journal the American Medical Association these products have the potential to cause severe adverse health effects\nI mean that's as clear as it could possibly be for somebody writing about medicine right and these supplements that are being sold that are very dangerous\nFit into three particular areas where items are being sold with extremely dangerous ingredients in them that can lead to heart trouble high blood pressure a number of things and they're most heavily\nDietary supplement is being sold to people that are trying to do a weightlifting build up muscle mass\nPeople they're trying to lose weight\nAnd people that are trying to help themselves in the bedroom\nAnd so those three areas which are that's one that's a pretty large segment those three are the dietary supplement industry and what I can recommend is what I've recommended in the past is that you buy dietary supplements that are us pi rated\nI'd dietary supplements that are us pi raided that it's an organization that has a voluntary code of conduct in the absence of\nFDA oversight based on a law passed by Congress last decade dietary supplements industry operates removed from and protected from normal safety oversight and only after the fact that leads to recalls\nDoes the FBI you have any power over dietary supplements so in other words people after suffer medical harm before there's any action but in this case where there's been action\nThe companies selling dietary supplements or like we're not going to recall them where they can do to us anyway and they're still for sale we\nA more or fewer and fewer people coming into showrooms fewer and fewer deals closing and depending on where you are in the country a lot are noticing a double digit declines in sales\nSo this is a great opportunity for you\nIf you were actually someone who's in a market for a vehicle it means that you're in a position to have far more negotiating power especially if you're interested in their crossover or an SUV you're much more negotiating power then you've had in recent

filling a black lady hill a ... if you thought that navy all the news is MTV uh for us it's the people that\nHave come down here for a dog or a little that it'd be interesting if anybody else who else throughout the ... early ... what was happening at the early those places that I tell you it is pretty nasty there\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nAt the years you know you've got one side on one side and the other side of the other side and you know one side trading at the up and\nTalking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning with so many feet of boom inside\n[laughter] yeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening if it wasn't it was it's not only screaming at the other people that they were like yeah\nBut it was it with a different party or parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases parties for at one and so even when they heard fulfilling on\nThings can't pay their and then the thing is happening in other places besides Florida I'd like to know if that's the way it was here\nYeah well again I I uh\nAre you in other words you have it in the in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the or\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox if you sit in an absentee ballot or or or no protest in the offices of let's say a a county uh\nUh the county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nWell well what they call it in the early ... are they going to go to this\nEarly election and then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to file and yes of course you can see the ... tower but you wouldn't I Would say that one\nThis story broke gets ... they're not knowing that that happened that I Believe that aired and there is Arnie that what I feel like a fall out later that Afghanistan I even heard\nOf them are ex pain on it I guess that's not that's not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states\nIn the Clinton Wyoming today as far as people in this state and had had been ongoing arrests factory\nIn healthy people that had been arrested for Twenty years he's been out on the street I guess that I think that for like ... [noise]\nUh yes if it reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times\nAnd convictions or or what would matter in terms of ah of the uh what about you prior restraint but uh see what you're saying that yes obviously something needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur oh let get calls in from Philadelphia tonight the good evening [laughter]\n[noise] yeah that was on your mind to hire so I'm trying a number\nAs I saw was I got up on what you're saying where laws and you know person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from my mother proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health it's even more under served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes in so many times yeah they brought the offer Beijing they put people on parole maybe they could have a thing\nWhere they ah but the along a mental probation where they they go to a specialist about the health professional\nAnd they get help and maybe if\nThat kind of thing was more expensive on the first place that person would never get to the place in our minds whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money that the health professionals are expensive that's one part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nAs the financial part of it and then the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that's just priceless especially after you know especially somebody could be better building these bombs and they say get lucky they get\nThose bombs or go undetected I something actually happens and people get hurt that prevent something like that with a little bit of that that is definitely something I see is priceless\nWhy isn't anybody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the\nSee I see a spice less well why somebody that I Would agree\nThat certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health to the science down to ... to do such that we can offer treatment to give ... let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defective brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need

American Hero and patriot and one who's not got the credit that she deserved and uh we have a call for our guest Jason ... from Lawrence in the champagne Illinois Lawrence a good evening and do welcome to the program\nThank you and good evening in both I wanted to share a some information about what was it may have made that original comment a ... years ago I was watching a historical presentation on native PBS or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was that it was no less than Benjamin Franklin who approached John Adams no less to uh make a comment that an apology was in order\nAnd for John ... it on to apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention and his wife a menu of and said that a famous line apparently that gentleman\nAnd his wife I'm\nBenjamin said that a famous slide a way that a gentleman don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the the the origin nation to that it is a credited describes living in in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that it's an sporting a I guess in in times of regular winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\n[noise] well I just want right I yeah\nWell I'll get a better get rid of the origin of the uh perhaps so I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I wanted to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\nSure [noise] church so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden's leaks ah you know the Snowden story he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans in this as a very surprising a lot of people surprising me and I started to read about the essay\nAnd history of being a sec when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy William Freedman Elizabeth read many husbands guy he's considered to be the godfather you say\nIf you go to end it stay headquarters at Fort Meade there's a large or\nBeing by the way is in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington but go ahead\nSo if you if you go to enter the headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman head outside of the auditorium is named in his honor\nAnd so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William ... who was the code breaker famous code breaker I started his wife Elizabeth was also cook brick yeah that's interesting right how ... how many husband or wife or could raking teams can possibly be\nA and so I started looking for more information on this day\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a link to a library Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died in Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down and sold off yet\nSo drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and you shoot I saw that I I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith treatment collection and and they were very friendly and they they brought out box\nOne of the twenty to a boxer this little is left I started reading her letters and I it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letter through hundred years ago I was just\nA immediately taken with her I mean she's such a such a vivid voice on the page uh and and the materials that library had where\nA or where the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would walk to stumble across it was her original college diary was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in code like one of the\n... ... ... what are going to see who else would do that right\n[laughter] right yeah no I mean it's it's actually it's actually kind of a lovely because we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a secret message is there's a way to\nUm as a way to hide things but for them it was a way to work them closer together and I I was just the the the ... of these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after spending some time with them that there was an untold\nStory here they really did need to hold it was a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the development\nOf American intelligence and the twenty century it's just kind of a genius to solve all kinds of problems and fix all kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she she was kind of like a jelly figure in American intelligence districts you\nCould ... I Want to come back and continue that thought as we will continue right after these messages\nTo guys that love talking pig skin down some of the players that may or may not be on his team going forward yeah yeah this is a pretty important we ... a great match that go all things\nSo they knew who she was\nRight they newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine and um and so yeah so there were there would be you know there'd be gangsters\nOr on trial a lot of these a lot of these run running rings where international crime syndicate it was essentially the mafia and so she didn't she would walk into court a unprotected with you know a paint\nDress in a in a in a of a hat with a flower pinned to the brand and she would stare down these guys the fence table you know five foot three and she was a explain exactly how she had broken echoed exactly how she had essentially stolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that time\nBut it was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft\nIn a court of law that's that's remarkable today of course the minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean you know these are things that were these are things that the uh\nLet me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not read many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit\nA a a an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army I was a a relatively small player albeit with a top secret clearance and the idea that she was ... the court as well this is how we did it I mean that that fruit marketable\n[noise] well I mean so you your your in your career you you weren't able to expose your sources and methods that would\nGet right to the last thing that you'll be able to be a good way for me to spend some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars is correct\nExactly exactly and and I and that's that was true that and it's true today but the fact the fact was at the time she had no choice she was she was asked asked to do this testimony by a federal prosecutors because the prosecutors needed to make cases against some of these international crime rings um\nThat were killing people and network controlling the the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys in prison they wanted to take down the east coast and it's the only way to do that\nWell it's actually try to make a case against them so in in which step Elizabeth and ultimately you know there would be a lot of publicity around these trials because it was kind of spectacular\nVisual to see the ... ah America you know an American woman American mother testifying against these guys so she got all kinds of newspaper coverage that were front page\nNewspaper stories about Elizabeth fell through the Nineteen thirties and uh and the tone of the more ... it's sort of was like a\nThere was a woman doing things that men could into I'm I'm looking right now at a at one of my favorite clips which is a a story a true story published about Elizabeth in in a magazine called true detection a detective fiction week weekly\nThe true story about her own and the title was lady manager and there was a line in a story about um how small slender American Woman stepped in\nAnd smashed crime where men had sailed\nA so she was she was a state tax and she was she was a spectacle\nFor ... and obviously that made a lot of her superiors very happy I'm sure\nOkay we're going to come back and talk more with Jason ... the

mind like this\nAnd yes a in a recent quote the president says he's toned down yes he has and it's about damn time that he toned down\nI think he may finally got the idea that his job is to be president of the United states then to pursue certain policies not to entertain his base he's better than he was with the fact is he still engages in rhetoric that create enemies he doesn't need and

this morning\nGood morning well if we've learned anything from the news over the years is that people visiting Thailand should take care to mind their ... while there were\nSome harsh punishment as a result\nWas lost on two tourists who had a few too many one night in are facing ten years in jail for graffiti tagging an ancient walled they're twenty two year old Canadian Brittany Schneider and twenty three year old be for long of the u._k.\nWere caught on surveillance video spray painting a message on the wall of the thirteenth century top paid gates\nThey admitted to the crime they may be crime to police and they also admitted they were quotes ridiculously drunk at the time\nThey face a court hearing about two weeks in could face up to ten years in jail or find them around thirty thousand dollars or both wow\nYes in what stage of drunkenness do you have to be to go out and find spray\nPaint and rights but apparently ridiculously I I just we got the term we found that out I guess as ridiculous as we do to go find the spray paint and a and then you know a fairly though I guess one of their names I think was what they actually tag the wall with\nAnd I mean I guess they manage they weren't drawn to drugs to sell their name correctly enough that the police are able to sort of recognize it and I get tracked him down\nThirteenth century yes wall yes yeah red spray paint I Believe it was a million dollars that's not going to come up to me\nAnd I just couldn't imagine like how this goes down in um in a tie court here on her for years we're just really drunk so we'll be going back home now know ten years\nYeah right or something like yes and uh you know there was a hard fought game but the Los Angeles rams juggernaut was too much for Aaron Rodgers in the Green Bay Packers yesterday with LA coming out on top twenty nine twenty seven\nAfterward Rogers did his normal post game press conference with a TV graphic on the local Fox affiliate in Milwaukee had a little bit of an error in it\nCatching the quarterback is Packers head coach\nThis of course is not lost on social media as many ...\nPassing attack you feel like it should have been there are guys are playing fast and it still can come away with a win so I'm Still trying to figure out a lot of these next four games they can the Packers when two or three\nBecause they you know it's kind of a money out of the north at this point but I see the patriots to see the dolphin\nWho are kind of a headache of a team I don't think they're great but it just seems to be challenging to beat them or they're short weekend Seattle and then at Minnesota a Minnesota spent a little up and down as well so\nIn a two or three wins out of there would be great but it you gotta start fast and you have to finish I think that was the biggest thing I saw yesterday scanned the inability to finish at the end of either has\nLet me ask the coaching question McCarthy ... it seems like during his tenure he looks at the regular regular season\nI can extend extension of training camp he developed but he he didn't so many young players every season it's like really an extension of that whereas you look at something like the New England patriots they treat every game like it's a playoff game I don't see that same\nI don't know what the word is efforts by the Packers and for many years these games they throw away games during the regular season that eventually come back to haunt them when it comes time to go to the playoffs causing you do not get home field advantage in some other things\nIs is there a difference between the teams when it comes to that because of the young players out on the team [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't know about that I think it it you know I don't look at yesterday's game and said where there was a lack of urgency um I I don't see that at all however\nIf you go back to games like what we saw against Detroit and what we saw against Washington\nJust inexcusable beginning to the game and trying to dig out of a just a normal hole\nAnd the Packers weren't able to do it so they had to sort of abandoned the game plan but then you're scrambling and it was just a collection of errors in those grades and yet that to me that points to coach and I don't look at it yesterday and say wait coach at last they gave the Packers I don't believe that I did I think the right instruction was given for time on camera I think you just chose to do something on his own\nUm and I don't know that he'll hang on to that position moving forward kicking a returning kick so um but it seemed like a defensive perspective the Packers play fast in fact some third down\nOn their first three drives if the first drive up substance for the rams and involve the effect on for goodness sakes even after I was a little short and so I you know effort in intensity and speed like\nIt to me it felt like it was there yesterday that doesn't mean everything was perfect um there's certainly some

Jones comes back in for the third period\nAnd then it's high Montgomery to close things out in the second quarter or you didn't see much I'm a veteran jumped at all the second quarter\nA ... you can't have one of your most explosive claimed makers on the bench for too long I understand having a system where you want to get multiple backs involved that does make sense to me I'm In the Williams is certainly deserving of play time it was a great class locker a good catch her receiver out of the backfield but don't just a ploy maker ...\nField but don't just a ploy maker and a on a team that need as many ways as possible year down the stretch or as you approach and will be on the halfway point of the season\nYou gotta find opportunities for explosive play makers to keep the defense got saying I don't think that the event as worried about them all Williams or Montgomery I think if they see thirty three they have to wonder what's gonna happen and then also stepped up your play action\nSo it's McCarthy hurting the team by doing what he's doing going with this running back by committee\nI I think it's time to leave a little bit more heavily on air and Joan I'm but he's got to be able to do everything that\nYou want a three down back to be able to do and they have to trust him a mentally and pass walking also uh and that's very words of all Williams is still very strong um I I Would lead a little bit more toward Williams at your backup I'm a Camry ethic is just kind of a third down receivers sort of an indicator of the defense\nBut his opportunities and carrying the ball I think needs to start to diminish um\nAnd when you need points in either out score teams the defense of little inconsistent I thought they were OK yesterday at time um but yeah a little inconsistent this season it made it that don't score caves and your best defense or best it might be ... in Arizona so I think deserves the bulk of the carrots\nI completely agree Greg massive joining me on Monday morning quarterback um my drive of the game and has to be the the drive the Marquez about us can't link forty are touched on past Aaron Rogers gives them the lead was about a almost a little less than nine minutes left\nA great drive by the Packers I mean it shows off the incredible skill at which is not breaking news by anyone any stretching imagination and Aaron Rodgers\nWould've been nice to see him be able to do that at the end of the game but we know what happened there so I give my driver the game the forty hour touchdown pass\nThey took the lead against the the best team in football we should just by record and\nI'll be by any measure what's your driving the games right\nYeah I mean I Would agree with you there I think just wear a team and the game was was critical to get back to back comes down to run their the Packers and they raised to pinpoint deficit\nTo take a a one point lead that drive you're talking about the was in the fourth quarter\nIt started with the Fifteen yard receptive aren't they at I'm at a screen play there and Jones that went nowhere to even off the Adams again for twenty um you had a another past there and jumped at one for one so it wasn't full of you know you a long sustained gripe here with a few pop play that got him into the end zone\nBut a great move on the line of scrimmage by the rookie Valdez gambling I mean it really started his defender well I'm beat them inside is a long drive that wants to get beyond it it's hard to catch him in a perfect ball by Rodgers and safety coverage was not so\nWhere that Dr came in the game was critical hackers had a lot of quick strike drives in yesterday's game they never really had a a long drawn out Dr against that ran them mhm but you know taking at one point lead with two forty nine left you you feel like you're in pretty good shape I'm In the rams ultimately we're able to get just enough done with their arguments\nLike math and joining me for Monday morning quarterback was that might want to be hotel casino or you want to weigh in the African American talking tucked signs for one's four seven nine nine one six twenty run asked a question uh\nAnd I get it up practice last week a good practice this week but the best I think the backers out in their facility at returning care and was pretty good at it last year so he might be that suitable replacement but I'm I'm leaning toward the end of the time I got really as returning gigs I don't think you can make a mistake like that on your team a game\nThat's Greg match stick it is Monday morning quarterbacks sponsored by how do I mean hotel casino will do it again next week the news is next right here WGM Jay [noise]\n\nThe sound of southeastern Wisconsin\nWhere are the global mobility is helping another executive and their families feel at home\nIn the new city T.

stories we see it across Milwaukee to stay there will be heavily focused on that shooting in Pittsburgh including local reaction from a lot of times and the market Jewish Federation and others\nKind of detailing what their response and they're feeling after this horrific shooting in Pittsburgh and he joins me every Monday morning the editor right Wisconsin James with us and good morning James good morning so let me get right to it\nUm I ask you the question over the weekend we're going back and forth or a big part of this of the conversation now\nIs in the\nCollective anger that we feel is a country when we when we have incidents like these these mass shootings and asked the question simply as do we have an anger management problem in this country\nElections you and I were talking during the break\nThe incredible popularity at least measure by poles of one Tammy Baldwin junior senator from Wisconsin I set you I don't get it in a state that I think even though it's voted for Democrats even though there's there's always the fifty fifty thing\nIf you look at the polls she is let's put it bluntly kicking we have ... ... but I don't get the fact that they're embracing at a very very extremely liberal senator explain it to the gym\nWell I think there's a there's a number of factors in there one is is there is certainly an anti Trump factor and they're especially among suburban women\nUh leave up here is losing among both educated and are college educated women and women that don't have a college education uh that's not the case with the governor he's certainly doing better with women that don't have a college education\nWhen you're running into that kind of a wall where women just are not supporting Leah ... we're going to contribute to Tammy Baldwin's overall numbers I'm part of the problem is is we are going to call it out this week because there's a lot of media bias\n... right now as they're not going after Tammy Baldwin's record they're not looking at it very closely we go after the ... you know we see the media going after Brad shovels record and we see the media going after Governor Scott Walker his record\nYou had Tammy Baldwin just seems to get a pass on everything and the only time the the homeless ever brought up it's always brought up as a quote unquote Republican attack rather than something that the reporters themselves report it at the time is it was it's fact that she neglected that situation\nSo is this a demonstration of advocacy journalism is it a bias built into the reporters life\nWhat what's driving well I think a large part it's just the culture of of the media right now but there is a certain amount of advocacy journalism going on especially when you know when we talked about the attorney general's race for example\nYou know we're going we're seeing them poor through Brad shovel ... record and everything like Josh call who was the prosecutor out in Baltimore now one story about the about that situation\nNobody's investigating whether or not he has any experience whatsoever and it's it's all this morning's Markey Journal Sentinel for example\nHas a top of the page story that they ran on line on friday\nAbout how the ... one of the attorney general's around the country that that gets involved the national law suits not mentioning the fact that Josh call would also get involved in national lawsuits against his favorite target\nIs an interesting time before we move on to the the ... um Walker race um state certainly has roughly a week to make her case I actually welcome her to come on the show it and make it as well what is you have to do to close that gap\nWell unfortunately she's going to have to figure out a way to to peel back to women uh\nIt's it's she's running right now and immigration and and a house supportive she is of Donald Trump's agenda and things like that it plays very well with the Republican base but it's not making that crossover connection to the independence\nThe swing voters that are that are actually going to help her out or we're going to discover I think unfortunately the hard way just what is the Republican base number in this election\nDo you think health care is is these soul I don't want to say so but one of the most driving factors for independent voters in the state of Wisconsin\n[noise] no I actually don't uh it's it's a complicated issue uh people don't like Obamacare but people don't like health care in general and every time that I'm told the healthcare is going to be the number one driving issue it never turns out to be that way\nJust like the year the woman never seems to materialize until the next election cycle [noise]\nUh what what really seems to me the driving factor right now is people are just very uncomfortable with the way Donald Trump does things in and leave all clear has been in the pro Trump camp she needed to be to win the primary\nBut now it is she hasn't been able to make that leap to the to the general election\nJames we just an editor right Wisconsin joining me before going to break just real quick on ...\nAnd um [noise] Governor Walker of depending on the polls which\nPulls you look at it it's a neck and neck race a governor up a little ... up a little uh as we had to get into the last week before the election next week people are already voting\nCould do good Governor Walker be impacted in this race by the the fact that there might be that anti Trump thing that you're talking about that that gives eras enough votes to beat the incumbent governor\nWell I I think so and then unfortunately what the governor has run into that you can't outbid the Democrats when it comes to spending on education or just ... thrown out of numbers Scott Walker's spending more on edge public education\nThan ever before and you just cannot outbid the Democrats on it they're going to always say that we need more and more and more and it's you know when or how much we actually put

and reforms of the way that\nThey should have over the last few years as a governor ran running an effective campaign [noise] it's pretty\nIran running an effective campaign it's pretty effective considering the headwinds that he's running into a first of all it's like it's a mid term election so that's always rough on the on the income and party\nSo that makes it very hard for for incoming

J.\nMonday morning forty five degrees at Radio City we're joined as we are every money by James\nWages in the editor of right Wisconsin are James James a week I had for conservatives as we lead up to the mid term elections there's all that frenzy I voted already is a lot of other people apparently have we have for conservatives what does it look like\nWell the big day is going to be on Wednesday when the market poll comes out so\nTrick or treat covering for everybody involved in politics here data to do that but I guess they go into and when I guess they always do it on Wednesdays and it just happens to fall that day out of that will be the last markup poll before the election and everybody's going to be looking at it and in person you have pulled down to the ... so the smallest detail\nOr ... or it's like Christmas for those of us though the politics we love to open up the president what do you expect to see in the polls that's different from the last one\nI think you're going to see probably more more movement towards Scott Walker I think this is depending on the rights they wrong or right track wrong track members ah hopefully the Packer losses and in the ... don't affect those numbers but we'll see\nUh the other thing that is just going to cost and everybody that has a yard sign of not only are you going running the risk that your yard signs are going to get stolen but if you're handing out candy when the night for trick or treat and you have a yard sign handout good candy 'cause you don't want us to reflect badly on your candidate\nYes so I'm I'm a I'm a family inside and I I'm a conservative\nAnd I go who gets to decide what conservatism is Steve\nAnd I I think that it's important that we support families don't support families and the tax code there was a recent article that said well hey\nIf a so we have a a birth rate right now one point seven uh children you know for a a per couple um I don't I have a point of the child but that's what the average is just to maintain a population you have to be a to point one\nUm and if you ask you know couples they want to have on average two point six children if they want to have more kids but they're not maybe want to incentivize\nYou know parents to have kids and um whether given a additional tax breaks for for couples who have you know three or more kids or your help them with their student loans don't forgive it but if moms have gone to school or want to go back into the home and raise kids until we get back in the workforce\nHelp them with their student loans let support families in public policy I think that would be incredibly helpful um and I think what's not helpful if I listen to the media\nAnd I I I'm shocked that they want to sell the feet of Donald Trump and I I just this is that there's there's there's bbs moving I don't know if you've talked about that but this is the boycott Israel when it's an anti Jewish movement\nAnd it you know it was a platform the Democrat Party that was debated I don't want to talk about politics but when they're trying to throw anti Semitism at our feet\nUm it makes me angry 'cause I'm In the Congress and I see how Republicans vote\nOn Jewish pro Israel issues and how Democrats vote and it makes me pretty mad that stuff gets skewed instead of what the politics you should talk about what are we doing wrong right now this wasn't happy we have a lot of gun Thirty years ago and this wasn't happening when I was growing up\nUm so what's changed is I think that's the deep dive we have to have a look at our society and our communities and go what's what different what's gone wrong and how they have a hard conversation about fixing it\nCan conservatives lead lead the way on this conversation I Know you and I've talked about this before and and you know conservatives are an interesting group we tend to believe in family in space and and and all that that presents for our lives in our lifestyles what can we lead the way in a in a in a more diverse country\nA country that maybe doesn't think like you and I think\nI think we can you know but you you're going to get some hate for it but I look at\nA meal ticket step back a\n... as ... there was kind of became the dog ... and just Bridget thinking and we had the thought process I think on trade you know we had to be free traders and to be free trade it it could be unfair for the American worker\nThat was the that was a dog of conservatism until it comes to hold on a second I'm about free trade food too but it has to be fair for us when people take advantage of America and the American worker we have to rethink how we're engaging in trade\nAnd because of that leadership you've seen a lot more conservatives and Republicans who do believe in free trade\nAlso come along to go yeah you're right Mr President has to be fair so to your point I think conservatives can lead on this will be more thoughtful and how we support you know young people who want to have families\nUm and and and raise them in a loving home and have a society that's far more carrying a and\nI'm far more engaging and left the attached and I'm less lonely by the way I don't think that if the left to\nIt because they hate guns but you know every kid my ... my kids want to watch movies there all the ones that you know blowing things up in the shooting each other and the video games that come from there\nThey are the most violent things ever we've got to have a ... again ... at a community conversation and Steve I think you know guys like us can lead the conversation to find out you know what

she seems to be with Wisconsin voters and can we make up that gap in the last week\nWell 'cause I I had the privilege of listening to the commercials that you wrong as I was waiting for you to come back on strategy mhm and that I hear that Tammy Baldwin is running commercials and I came up here as well as a\nTax cutter yeah I'm going to try to put more money in your pocket\nAnd you know ... you would think that she's a conservative by the CI Ron I'm In my hair on fire and listen to it because as we've fought to reform the tax code in lower rates for families\nAnd make sure our businesses can be competitive in our tax code because we just don't compete against you know Minnesota and Michigan and in Illinois we compete against\nChina India in in Vietnam and Europe and she voted against all those reforms that kick started this economy and here's the deal comes down to money can be boiled and has money has had money to lie about her record in ... and she's a moderate\nDemocrat when kids are radical I'm you know Bernie Sanders ask liberal that's why that's why so many people have been supportive because they don't know the true record and ... ... ah went through a tough primary spent a lot of money it's kind of we saw six years ago with Tommy Thompson same thing happened\nAnd to get your message out is challenging and cameras raise a lot of cash and she's able to go and distorted her her record that takes away the the you know the the socialist Madison viewpoint and makes it seem like it's an everyday Wisconsin perspective so\nHow she had done it but I'll tell you this Steve I'm from what I've heard on the inside with our model earth um and we have some of the best model in our state that model turn out and shoot down by\nA lesson to point right now really calls um so you

Ron Johnson was at this time in the election two years ago\nSo again you can hear you drive your message and how many how many voters do you think really say I know I'm gonna vote for Scott Walker\nAnd Tammy Baldwin either there can't be that many of those borders and so they think about who they're going to vote for Scott can lead the ticket for for ... and a lot of those voters who are

has contributed I think to the rise of mass shootings now some talking heads will sit here today and this week and tell you these things are always going to happen there's no increase that's a media driven thing\nLet's be real I can cite\nA shooting at a concert in Las Vegas shooting a place of worship horrific shootings at school from elementary at Sandy Hook to high school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas do not sit here or talk to the point that these things are increasing they are\nAnd the fact is given how smart we are as a country how many intelligent people we have out there\nWe should be

it\nAnd my question for these companies the Facebook's the twitters others I'm not even talking about some of these extreme social media platforms which cater to violence and hates that's a whole nother reality\nAnd while I Believe in free speech fundamentally free speech that threatens violence is not protected shouldn't be protected\nAnd especially in this case when ... was directly threatened by somebody on a on a social media platform\nIt doesn't need to be that difficult if you're going to have a platform that involves written communication as as is the case with Twitter you need to have policies and practices and enforcement the follow up\nOn that I'm a big fan of Twitter\nBut it's hard not to see connections between the ramping up of this anger and hatred and

support transit when it makes sense I was I was a big fan of connecting people's people two jobs and uh we do that no creek I see it happening between Markey county Waukesha county that part of that makes sense\nI actually think there's some potential there for some further uh connections\nThat gets people jobs and and I guess the clearest most glaring example would be Foxconn I don't know that\nI'm biased against mass transit I just don't think the streetcar is the form of mass transit that makes the most sense and thanks for the call bill as always frequent was in the program was go to Kyle from del children's will be TMZ\nHey thanks for taking my call ... ... what do you have\nActually worked out on your corner in Hawaii you wherever the inner ... back in ... and I mean I under the driver there but they changed the white\nWine that come up for our ... ... ... made it that you know we've noticed out anytime there are a little over ... why why and I have a a a green light to read\nAnd they have to wait for that are either go through or back up and I mean there were they on the ballot box or minutes\nOr cars that the best I Know we watch you know I've been doing as a minority or better but I mean I'm just waiting for an act there are going through the rabbi\nAnd somebody who's observing that used to get the sense that drivers understand what their responsibilities are\nNo not at all the terrible I mean the\nThe line that they changed the line to begin with a stranger about that and go there is no real sign that direct a car I mean they need to make it more than that and like I said I mean we sometimes where I mean the train has a very annoying or ... or you're going to hate it\nBut we think are so far back that\nThey don't know what's going on in the conductor and actually talk to the car but no I mean that in fact I don't know the only one that I thought that way but on a daily basis we look out the window lap look on your car\nAnd I think for the call ... ... there's going to be a learning curve here for both to hop operators and drivers\nAnd again we haven't even gotten to the challenging part of our driving year when when the snow and ice become a real thing when when the snow drifts and snow piles and harden chunks of ice impact everything\nSo figuring this this dynamic relationship between\nThe streetcar vehicles pedestrians is going to be really interesting and as I said I reached out some local attorneys on this and they're already lost and will we see that going forward potentially let's go to Dick in graft in your interview teams you good morning to\nGood morning I'm I've had some experience and writing and using light rail and other cities and take Tampa for example you can take light rail from downtown Tampa to wipe or city and I've done that one\nAnd um I Would say that it might get Fifteen Percent occupancy at any time\nOr I don't see how they're paying the bills that's the concern that got for the one in Milwaukee um I Lived in New York City from two thousand two to two thousand five rode the subway to work every day it's the concentration of people that want to move from point a to point B that's going to pay the bills\nWhile we were in New York we went over to Hoboken and Jersey City to look at apartments thinking it's a lot cheaper over there and we might want to live there they had a light rail down\nWe wrote it a number of times on various weekend looking at apartments and often we were the only people in cars now a month ago we were back they're staying in Jersey City and a lot of people are writing the light rail now\nBut they have thousands and thousands of a new apartment buildings high rise buildings [noise]\nTwenty five to thirty five stories tall that people are living in and those are the people that are using a light rail and they use the light rail to get from where they live two uh two different path stations right that allows them to take the ... the path train to Manhattan\nYeah I think I think it's great great called their grade point it it's going to be about density I think there's a gamble being made here\nOne of those folks in Milwaukee there are ... you know we've got some density increasing the third ward a little bit down town we have the potential of the of the other developments that could be could be coming up on the ground these high rises these condos these apartments that could increase the density and uh provide a market for these things but ultimately\nThe one place it would have made sense for me is to get people to Miller Park from downtown I think I would've been a no brainer you know you could have done something else connected some some a lively restaurant area and the third war or something like that the roasted they've

I Want to ask you a positive person I've I dealt with the trends you know ... you're familiar with that as well\nHow do we make forward progress in the time right now where we are just one dealing with the transit to trying to figure things out\nWell tell you uh you know we're used words like a pain and anguish and an anger um\nAnd uh and fear but ah one other emotion I felt on Saturday a was a was a lot of love 'em and uh you know that came apart from you and and many in the greater community who reached out not just to me but to to people they know or Jewish\nOr and express their their concern and support and\nThat gives me the real sense that not all is lost and and you know as someone who is a part of the people who'd experienced great tragedy um and challenge and uh and hatred and\nAnd persecution or throughout our history we have never given up and we've always we always pushed forward and and sought to overcome and knowing that in the end justice and righteousness and truth\nI'm and love prevails so I Believe that because there are so many people in this country who who share in that that that we can we can really change things and make a difference and if our political leaders aren't going to set the tone and aren't going to provide the leadership then it's up to us to do that\nDo you think that social media I mentioned this earlier in the program as well I think social media has an anger management problem you know somebody who actually enjoys Twitter and Facebook for the for the positive reasons and in in the good things that can offer there is a negative\nAspect to where it does the a lot of the ditch your own the heat and I think drives some people some people who maybe aren't in touch with reality to do things they maybe wouldn't do\n\nIt there's no question that ah that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nThat his hatred was stoked and fueled in ... that he contributed to what you find on on social media um\nAnd I would agree with you and and I'll be honest with you there are times where I've been guilty of not really engaging kind of a you know discourse that ah that one should\nBecause we we look at things today in such a zero sum game and we're so tribal are and what I've tried to do of late is simply focused on trying to\nGet\nOther person I Am in in conversation with\nThat I I Try to try to hear her him\nThat I I Try to try to

J. good afternoon\nGood afternoon thanks for taking my call her what do you think of\nYou know I I Want a cut them or wouldn't you know make them a scapegoat Aaron Rodgers has the ball with six minutes left him and they went three now so now you're you're telling me that you made the ball back in their hands to Mexico so they can work his magic worker magic with six minutes to\nGo I guess I Would argue that the issue I mean if you're if you're the coach if you're the boss\nAnd you come up with a planet and maybe you're right maybe Rodgers goes and get sacked twice or throws an interception or whatever you don't know that but if your plan is I Want the ball in Rogers hand you tell the kick return or don't return to kick catch the ball and the guy ignores you directly disobey she'll how can you allow him to still be on your team\nWell I I I don't know for sure but I'm sure there are other players who have struck some of the rules and I think that's where the problem is that like are the for the sheer last you know number of years well lost control completely but I think a lot more control than than people you and I am probably ...\nAnd that could very well be looking I mean I think\nYou know ... and maybe if the Packers can't turn this around and aren't able to make a serious one to the playoffs maybe Mike mccarthy doesn't come back next year now and and that's all well and good and look and I understand they don't have a crystal ball I'm just saying\nI don't see how whether if you're a boss whatever if you have somebody who is directly disobedient to you does what you exactly what you told them not to do\nThat in and of itself 'cause most people fire\nIs maybe he could have pulled it off and work maybe they look the other way don't do that don't do that old go run run run\nBut he you not only disobeyed the coach intentionally but then you screwed up as well and cos team any chance of winning\nHow can you how can you address the team how can you keep the respect to the team if you allow people to just be blatantly disrespectful of you for one for seven eight nine when six twenty John in Illinois John you're there'll be team drink good afternoon\nThanks for taking my call sir I'm\nYou know just got a I was pregnant and watch the game you know like most of us it was a nail biter but what was really amazing and nurses are thought to myself what would this\nOne [laughter] curious about what was then from body of Don and I guarantee you ... would have been accurately ... don't come back\nWell he probably would have gotten cut in the locker room [laughter] you know ... ...\nI mean you you just because you just can't tolerate that that type of stuff and and again it's just it's it's not whether the Packers would have gone on to win the game or not it's that the guy disobeyed instructions and then ultimately cost of the game but if you're the coach you can't allow that to go on\nAbsolutely and again I remember you know make it a fumble nobody wants to but it just so bad\nBut it might make and and now thanks to call and apparently you putting these together and it appears\nLike I say there's all these reports that he was mad in the previous series because he got to take it to you got taken out and so he's throwing this is his he said on the sidelines slim and stuff around he's mad he's yelling because he was taken out\nSo you get the idea that he's kind of taking the attitude of screw him I'm I'm going to show up I'm going to do what ever I I Want to do and you can't do that I just I don't think you can do it I'm Mike calling us from Chicago Mike you're on WGM Jay good afternoon\nYeah your electric talking just first of all it was just another disappointing off your humidity\nIt gave I restructured before but I I guess the coaches orders or yeah if the caller said that Roger shows why would fix but that's the goal yeah sure you didn't do it but that doesn't mean you can't win the game with two minutes\nWhen you get what the game with to it yeah so I I don't feel the ... you can't quite America would you what it was it was All right so\nIf you can find the culture's better for him I Would go\nYou have no sense of ... and I mean it and they look in in ...

President Trump says well you know meats\nMaybe we need armed guards at at these places of worship and and again I understand\nThat if you would have armed guards outside of Richardson synagogue or mosque it would make them not as much of a soft target but he is that really a practical response let's start with Chris and Madison pressure first good afternoon\nThanks for taking my call 'em you know I as I was listening to this and I heard from say the first thing the one who am I had\nAnd ... by saying I have a concealed carry and I do own a firearm but after taking the class I don't carry because the reality of your ability to actually do something with a firearm unless you're highly trained\nIs a very very effective and if you had a security guard was saying that now with a lot of side\nOkay by the time the guy comes crashing through the door he's number one he's prepared to die\nI think these people are prepared to die when they are making a statement and they want to take out wherever they can with 'em and they have no regard for their own life and the likelihood is they're going to take that security guard out\nI mean it happens so infrequently when you think of every church everything going on every single day when this happens it is even though it one time is way too many fight and it was way too many but what's the likelihood you could actually stop somebody like that they're coming in\nIn a blaze of glory and they're they're gonna they're gonna have to die\nAnd and so historically thankfully I mean this ... you ... you have trick shootings you have synagogue shooting shift shootings at mosques but\nBut given all the number of times that Americans worship it it's not like this is thank the lord ... is an everyday occurrence it is thankfully an extremely rare sort of thing which then makes you wonder right is by putting you first of all you're correct you know would that stop it would deter it would it make it less dangerous\nBut also is is it worth it is that the right way to deal with the fact that thankfully this this doesn't happen\nVery often at all\nYou know I think might be a better way to go about it is doors have to be on and they have to be a walk in there has to be somebody standing at the door and you know you have to be checked and all that violence you know you you don't have to Ireland with violence which you can protect yourself from it\nYeah ... I actually have a couple of other theories summaries cussing as the program goes on including the fact that\nThis is it the shooting rampage if you look at the background of the shooter it's not like he was shy about keeping is\nAnti Semitism or I mean he he this guy was hunting the dark Web talking about you know all that how he hated Jewish people and things of the like this I think raises some of these larger issues which is do we need to be more effective in a dense defying\nThe hate mongers does are out there whether it's religious hatred or whether it's political hatred or whatever\nThere is religious hatred or whether it's political hatred or whatever and do we need board to be more aggressive in getting them off the streets in the first place as opposed to trying to do this prevention for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to David on the west side David ... good afternoon\nGood afternoon first time caller thank you for joining us so I\nAm an Orthodox Jew and it was pretty shocked and taken aback by the whole story it was heartbreaking to care I you know look up on you to see what the president said and I suppose you without a political rally and say\nWell he thought were the most points specifically this comment about you know if there was an armed guard this wouldn't have happened um\nI used to work in a school and pretty much the consensus of everyone was the only white depriving an armed guard have someone else to be shot first that everyone else around to recover\nI don't think an armed guard were unable to do anything other than you know be the first the sacrificial goat so to speak\nWell now I mean I guess sometimes that's true in other cases you we had high profile even high profile shooting instances that have been\nUm ... have been a lot better or worse because there was the presence of an armed guard really able to gauge the shootout pretty I mean I I right I I understand it you know if you have somebody like our last caller was saying was prepared to die and comes in heavily armed\nChances are that that that armed guard is going to be out gun to start off with ... you know moving before you get to whatever the next step is\nTry I Do agree that in some cases that are either police car parked outside somewhere I mean I've seen it on corners in our people run stops stop signs all the time so they just part at least or they're just at the turn of the activity right and this and that particular case I don't think it would it would it out\nI agree in some cases uh somebody or more to help but unfortunately in this particular case president was way off the mark\nYeah I don't I mean just as a practical matter when you think of all the different churches and synagogues mosques and other respective places of worship there there are\nI don't think you can say to every pastor rabbi or a minister whatever okay here we we we expect you to go higher an armed guard that that's just flat out not practical in today's society it it's just it's not going to happen I don't know if you have enough armed guards to do that\n[laughter] I aside from that I don't I don't know many Senate guy off the top may have that just have the extra funds\nRight now that we're hours a day\nYeah or churches or or whatever no I mean it gets see that's it it's it's\nIntellectually I guess I I understand it I didn't think it was particularly helpful because I get I just don't think it's practical to\nYou know go to ... again at ... at church or synagogue or whatever and you know he's he's right when he's talking about the extra funds and say okay this is what what you do we we expect you that you're going to you know make a hiring decision and you're going to have an armed guard at every door is just\nMaybe some red flags should go off somewhere and we we should start being able to check this out\n'cause that that's I guess the key trying to stop these things and these cooks before\nBefore they're actually able to act out to that point when we come back after the top of the hour I Want to talk about the role of firearms in this situation and I have but I think is a provocative question

J. good afternoon\nThanks for taking my call built um it it just always amazes me whenever there is a mass shooting of this type and they're all tragic can we all wish they would not happen\nBut the knee jerk reaction that his anti gun is they want to take guns away from the people that aren't using them improperly and using them commit these crimes it just it it just logically that makes no sense to me why would you take things away\nFrom someone like me who has a legal right to own them and write one hundred percent what never even consider committing a heinous act\nLike ... and you are in ... and it would have vast majority but the extreme majority I mean the thing you're talking about ... and they're always give him a\nMiniscule amount of people that are going to use firearms in this fashion and as you said before they're gonna make fertilizer bomb if you take their got away with it at Oklahoma City you know eating is a fight for that and and still was able to push your agenda and I I Would follow up with what you were saying that there's got to be a way\nTo go back maybe I wasn't thinking First Amendment but you're thinking along those lines that\nIdentify people that are possible threats and if that means that we rewrite the laws of what you can post on the Internet what Ken\nWhat government can go in and look at to try and identify cheap or threats like that and said they knew that some but go taught by somebody who was trained in that area to go boy this guy is a possible threat let's pursue legal action and continuing on down away without\n'em right violating any of his rights in any way\nGetting into it and I think that's I mean the more I think about this I guess I think that's kind of the way to go because you every once in a while you have these these shooting situations to just come out of the clear blue\nBut more and more whether it's the pipe bomb or last week or the guy on Saturday you you go back and they've left a trail I mean there if there is not bread crumbs his giant loaves of bread\nShowing you know how how they hated this particular type of people are this group of people it's it's not surprising to me that's where you got to concentrate these people that are out there they're making these expressions is antisocial type of stuff\nYou have to be able to identify them and maybe even prosecuted but some of the hateful things that they're saying rises to the level of of a threat or close to a threat\nRight and the only way that you're going to be able to come up with solutions like this is if people point check their emotions at the door when you want to have a conversation like right there you're not going to have a logical all the states and if I were on the left\nI ... and if I were on the left and having a you know a ...\nAnti gun agenda we could have an intelligent conversation and maybe come along and that would write benefits both sides but whenever there was anything like this I think it was they were that emotionally and that immediately throws logical right now I Can't come ... come up with any reasonable solution\nWell exactly and it's interesting and that that's one of the reasons I tried to start off with the numbers and if you think about that it it I get into this argue with some of my friends on the right to say okay Jeff what part of what part of the illegal immigration don't you understand\nAnd I and I always say okay let's assume for the sake of argument that there's eleven billion people who are in this country illegally let me tell you in the real world there's not enough you know you can't\nRight now send everybody back there's not enough the immigration judges to do that we don't have the infrastructure it is just\nNot something that is practical so if you're trying to deal with the people that are in this country illegally you have to prioritize things you just have to do that well I mean it's the same thing when we have this conversation about firearms that's why I start with number there's two hundred and sixty five million guns in in civilian hands two hundred sixty five million\nTell me how you're going to tell me how you're going to get rid of those guns there's forty if even if you wanted to know forty percent of the population give or take\nOwns firearms tell me how you're going to get rid of those those guns it's just not a practical thing and so I think we have to start thinking beyond that knee jerk reaction and and to me again it would start with being more aggressive as far as monitoring the these sites\nRight left in between I don't care where you have the raising anti Semite or you have the people that are threatening harm against this part of society or that part of society start with that\nAnd maybe for those people who cross that line maybe we should start looking and saying okay that this they should be a prosecutor black if you're expressing this type of hatred out on some sites on the Internet now than it used to be\nThere were always these these fringe people that were out there but before the ... the Internet give everybody a place to go it gives you know that these folks who beforehand\nWould just be modeling of themselves and their mother's basement you know now they've got these Web sites that they can go to and they could share their hateful thoughts with other people who otherwise would just be mumbling and their mom's basement and they can kind of get together and feed off each other that's where we are twenty Eighteen it is the reality is the underbelly of the Internet\nBut you know maybe that's where we should be concentrating some law enforcement resources for these people who are going out there saying I ate all Jews and I think they should all be killed or whatever well maybe\nMaybe you'll saying stuff like that in advocating things like that at the very least if it's not a crime and it's not acceptable you should at least have police on your doorstep saying what's going on here to say one twenty seven ...\nHow long it Wisconsin business has depended on pressing electric supply\nCompany for electrical hardware supplies when they first

afternoon\nOr good afternoon Joe I yes I Do agree that he ... you know there there there are more survived really of individuals who have done the pain of Akron and my prayers go out of the families who have been impacted by this is\nThe fact is is is that he is the president of United States hello yeah ...\nAnd ... and he has the responsibility that has a primary United States and the bully pulpit in order to bring in this country together but when he uses phrases when he uses phrases like Nassau of\n... and ... and things of that for ... and and and and and you have individuals like David Duke and and and the white supremacy basically praising him for his actions that not only that says by the word\nThe fact is he has he has the power to come on and try to tamp down the fact is a you know I don't know president President Obama is a racist or not or or that but the fact is that the problem is that these individuals who ... we'll preach the hate breezy\nBelieve that he was on their side and so so when you see individuals coming out and then they're they're planning part bombs and say just because he calls me the the the press the uh\nThe enemy of the people wherever you hurt that kind of language from Latin America not an American you ever heard of that kind of language you've heard that and and and Karen is China you've heard that in Russia and and and and Nazi Germany\nThat depresses the enemy of the people and he and he and he pointed that today you know and and so you know yeah he has a responsibility as as the leader of this country and and and and and and the native country in order to to to to try to treat treat that office for respect that he has a\nLet me ask you is mentioned when somebody like for example Hillary Clinton describes half of the people who support President Trump as being\nA basket of deplorable ... you know massage in this day you know racist homophobic et cetera et cetera is is that the type of rhetoric that we could then say for example in ... the shooter who showed up in Washington DC and shot congressman ...\nOh yes you can if the game you can you give yes we can equate that weight but that kind of a center that kind of a a language\nTo somebody deciding that do to take that as a trigger to go off and do something they're paying for that individual dead\nAnd so this ... this this is the problem is that the language that we have\nThe language that are going on in this country it it it it started to manifest itself and he's kind of thing and so but but but but Hillary Clinton is not the president she doesn't have that bully pulpit at that are ... that that President Trump and the fact is that he is continuing to\nThe fact is that that that that when you get those individuals individuals and in Pennsylvania uh if if they don't even want him to calm\nBecause the fact is still out he killed here as the accepted a white a white supremacy and racism in this country and he refuses\nHe refused to denounce little bit but then he goes to his rallies and he puts out this cold and and and and sending very language in his rallies that it that is definitely bring in this country to to me\nTo call I guess I Would say I I understand I I I think if we start with the basic point that there are\nThere are we always had heated political rhetoric in it and they understand\nThe people always think that oh this is the worst period of time but but there's always been heated political rhetoric I mean I you're old enough you can remember you know what was going on in this country during the Vietnam War for example where you really had\nTwo sides were pitted against each other and it was pretty much anything you know anything goes with regard to you know the heated degree of rhetoric\nIf you want a more recent example I mean remember when when you had the invasion of Iraq by President Bush should we remember the things that were said that's where you really saw but I Would describe as the heat of the the rise of of the heat left\nWe're you know you can say anything you can do anything I'm for President Trump's perspective yeah I mean I I think the rhetoric is over the top I've been saying that since he became a candidate I Wish he would dial it back\nUp a little bit I Would like to see the president be you nighter\nBut my point is heated political rhetoric is nothing new now maybe
