{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "It was just a shrinking as of subscribers it's the the size of papers actually shrunk as well I looked through I think goes Monday's edition\nAnd as I you know you have to look for story ideas or or or things you can talk about on the show and I'm thinking there's not a heck of a last year that I can use to develop it it's a really slim down version of what my expectation is of journalism\nYeah I think in some ways um they they in some ways they do a lot with what they have actually started\nWorking on some of their investigative stuff as yet radical Mexico resorts story I Love that\nIt is and I'm at all I just attack them I I I missed what the paper was the papers so important\nYou know I'm going to talk about the fourth estate as essential to democracy and I think that we're we we we'd be better off with what we had but we don't we don't have it anymore so they still do some good stuff but many days and I think it's just because of the economics of the industry they don't have enough people to produce anything that's of interest and then what they do produce\nI think this may be as we're heading is too often advocacy journalism\nSo I'm reading ... your publication by badger Institute and and the peace left on the doorstep and asked the question hidden agenda question mark Wisconsin newspapers failed to disclose left wing funding sources for hundreds of stories they've published let's talk about that what do you mean by that\nWell so this is a really an analysis of the Wisconsin Center for best gave journalism based out of your your W ...\nYes and the University of Wisconsin Madison actually provides free space for them for a folks that I consider to be based on what they produce advocacy journalist so you have government essentially you W Madison providing free space and time donation to advocacy journalists who then turn around and\nProduce stories that are given to the mainstream media the getting that in this isn't just a this isn't just an occasional thing Steve or a damned bashing wrote this story actually former former a game that journalists themselves former Journal Sentinel journalist [noise]\nUm did a story and counted over seven hundred instances of us are for best gave journalism pieces appearing and then that paper since two thousand Thirteen\nGive me some idea of what those storylines we're we're about\nWell you can go on to their website and see how they describe themselves and I think right there is proof that Israeli advocacy journalism I'm so we've had a whole series of stories about Scott Walker and as they describe themselves an attack that's the word they use on public sector unions\nOkay I Know folks who are in unions would consider it an attack I Know many people would say that what act ten did is not good for unions but there's another perspective too I mean how 'bout to actually describing it as what Scott Walker has done for taxpayers through at ten so\nThe way they frame their stories and they probably maybe don't even realize it themselves as a as I think has perspective somewhat safe biased and does advocacy but that's just one example there seven hundred of these uh of these are stories that have appeared well some of those I I Can't say seven hurt me some of these stories have appeared in multiple\nGet out papers but another one that a damn back some pointed out was one from last uh last August die in which they I think it's fair to say lamented the speed at which the Walker administration has pushed through some significant legislation I saw that yeah you know so those were a couple of examples\n... here's how I see it playing out when I when I look at the coverage and I read everything about the elections where I was obviously the mid term elections coming up I read everything about them and and I and I look at the stories the choice of the editors make\nOr to send reporters outs ah at two do uncovered certain elements and it does seem like just from the casual perspective of somebody who talks about politics for a living\nThere seems to be an increased emphasis on covering the critical elements of the Walker campaign less so leaders campaign let me give it a direct example the plagiarism story last week\nTony Tony Evers responds with no discipline we acknowledge that have happened and that that was like the\nEnd of the story where's the heart journalism things on on that story and why is that not continue to be\nAs I mean I I have to say that I I was a little surprised especially with journalists who if you plagiarize in a newsroom at least when I was in a newsroom he got fired his a big deal and it's a big story\nIt's really a big deal when it's when the policy of posted on your own website department public construction and yet you were found guilty Tony Evers being the user of doing that very thing yes there's no discipline in there\nYeah and you know I Do I Do think that a lot of reporters they do to make an effort to be fair to to be to be objective um and and often succeed I'm with the stories that they do right I'm not always but I just think they're in an atmosphere where they often don't see\nThe things of interest to folks who are in the center even let alone on the right so it's also the things that they don't pay the questions that they don't ask\nWe're talking to Mike Nichols president of the ... Institute like you to take a quick break here we come back other issues facing journalism in in the era of Donald Trump and as we said to be contentious Wisconsin election season that's on next right here WTO\nForty five minute with you on this whether they're happy [laughter] everybody forty six degrees at Radio City over the place where\nYou are thanks for listening as always we're joined by Mike Nichols the president of the ... Institute and we want to get one more thing about transparency or as we were talking about the advocacy journalism and just the press in general\nYeah I just wanted to make one more point him in the world is sort of heading towards advocacy journalism and let's have some transparency right I mean you have a W Madison is actually making any kind donation to an advocacy journalism group and that just recently stories that are running into can have papers but\nUh okay um you know can add needs a copy to fill a whole but let's be transparent about it and tell people who these folks are\nOr who are producing these stories that are running in the main cause you never know that George Soros has given that group a million dollars\nUm ... you know over until a couple of years and they give them a million dollars you'd never know who the other funding sources are you'd never know that it's very very fair to characterize them as at least\nAt least left leaning if not just progressive so I mean let's let's let's have some transparency about above who folks are uh if you're going to run their stock the I don't see that and that it's kind of it's kind of offensive is not um it it's it's not it's not it's not ethical terms of the way a way I understood journalism ethics\nYeah for for somebody went to school for broadcast journalism I understand what I think I understand what the rules should be of disclosure and being ethical are probably some of the principal tenants of that profession do you think consolidation of the newspapers you mentioned the connect group and and how that's all come together has that contribute to this\nI'm not I'm not sure about that I mean you look at their reach ... still way down from where it used to be I mean sure they've consolidated can add ons temp papers but I'm the journals down to a hundred and thirty thousand or something on Sunday that\nConnect the you know given that the other Tanner are down I think\nOn Sundays to a hundred and a fifty thousand total so I'm sure they're consolidating but uh and they're and they're one voice now ah but hey you know they started there don't have to reach that they used to\nHear that somebody who who died just a lot of newspaper accounts I mostly on line it's interesting you got all these different websites always papers to cross the state has all the same concept so you can really have an easy process I Want to ask you quickly about journalism in the age of Donald Trump presidents who uh is\nI I used this term uncharacteristically on presidential in the way he communicates and do you think that's been a challenge for journalists to kind of push aside some of the by especially we've seen some Jemma ... of the world but Caitlin ... already announced that seemed to have a running battle with the president\nHad well two things I guess it applies to Governor Walker's while there's a lot of criticism all their Governor Walker and the Trump mission and that is that is completely appropriate right and the longer somebody's in office as with our current governor more Christmas and he's going to get from journalist and as it should be so so criticism yes but\nWhen you have somebody like a New York times during the election that comes just outright and says that they see it as\nUm if out their mission um you know I guess part of their of of of of the way they're going to proceed\nTo actually work against Donald Trump is actually what they did that's that's that's not right or if it's not on your editorial page I shouldn't be happening in the news pages so uh I mean I think there's a lot of admission that you have again some advocacy journalism going on\nIt does it certainly seems like that a couple of minutes left with Mike Nichols from the badger Institute there's a great piece by ritual hormones you W women's studies programs and maybe the lack of ideological diversity for young you'll be hundred courses now\nRight offered right and a half a tour after tour to that page and read read some of these courses actually Steve I'm so you know simply undergraduate runner undergraduate courses at you W and the gender and women's studies program\nTheir race gender colonization capitalism sex and power and Greece gender migration um the female body in the world are you know and then there's a we have a bunch of stuff in here about who the who the professors are and what they write but you know the big question there you know if you imagine now has one of the biggest women and gender studies programs in the\nCountry it's second only to another Big Ten school Michigan and or is this really is this really an academic discipline or is it activism and if it is a discipline should there be as much activism as there is there there's a perspective there and I'm sure we really be be funding activism or at at at with our tax dollars\nYou don't eat typically the way our country works as things go in cycles are ways whether it's in the liberalization of of our educational institutions there's no there's no way\nThe the way our country works as things go in cycles are ways but in in the liberalization of of our educational institutions there's no there's no way there's no cycle it's just it's it continually ramps up when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting degrees and\nIt's hard to be optimistic about the future of those institutions when you see that kind of course we'd be of course being generated there\nAnd of course I wasn't involved in prostitution is even ever I haven't weighed all the evidence but look at this case\nI look at the circumstances and the fact that I Do know you lose the photographers property she disappears cars found\nBurn pits suggests they dispose of her body that way we have concessions\nAnd that's the other big piece of this is the concession to bring the Daschle whether that's a real confession are already force confession\nNo spoon fed by detective we can all go into those sides store but for me it's never been about guilt or innocence either he's guilty\nAnd I think Steven every should wrap the less the rest of his life in a jail so but you can weigh in on Twitter you can weigh in on Facebook as well and join the conversation for one for seven nine nine one six twenty second mortgage talking touched my I'll take your calls read your tax\nSeems to be with you on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay that's next lemons sixteen and see somebody with you on WGM generally are monitoring the latest from New York City and Washington DC so if you haven't followed this story a CNN actually had a threat called him an see evacuated explosive device\nOr one was attempted emails to the Obamas\nOne showed up at the the home of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... New York\nUm they're still trying to assess what exactly that means or where they came from no motive was is known of course this time but I Would say the federal government is on high alert\nA given the seriousness of this situation so we'll continue to monitor that throughout the day right here in WGM Jay I'm no recent developments but I Will I'll stay tuned with at least one eye on on one of the monitors as we pay attention that serious story coming from New York City on the east coast the United states right now we're talking about making a murderer\nSeason to join us on Facebook that six twenty WGM Jay our Facebook page or you can call us and the mortgage talking touch land for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I asked a question on Twitter as well\nJust watching the Netflix series season one or two which to me ah she's into a debuted on friday\nChanged your mind or do you think he's guilty or innocent I make it as simple as that guilty or innocent or Stephen every a pall on Facebook guilty and makes me wish Wisconsin that the death penalty Susan on Facebook guilty as well let's go to Scott in why what's ... good morning Scott\nGood morning Steve thanks for taking the car I Believe both ... and a free are both guilty or her her body was her bones were found in three different from two of them behind his trailer\nWhich means that they have no other oh of course but it took time to remember the ... this poor child mhm\nAnd burn her in three different on your property or all of the best position of planting evident that all the new show are you really gotta drilling down to where she was found in what condition she was found in\nYeah I agree with you and thanks for the call Scott I I think the the circumstances of that discovery\nThe storyline that suggests she got her to ... are out there to photograph one of his vehicle\nAnd the and the discovery of her body yeah there's always things that you can't make the case for his part of it you know no one's ever a hundred percent guilty writes you you make the best case and a judge or jury decides\nTo me that's been done you know what the I think we're making a murder tries to do is just to supplant evidence with theory conjecture um they're trying to point I was reading your rights are pointing to the whole box ex boyfriend Ryan he'll I guess\nI'm framing it that way that he had something to do with a questionable action suspicious actions and are also people point to bring the deaths whose brother Bobby is likely killer I think one of the things that you notice it is is when when filmmakers make these kinds of show\nDominance by the gym that one of my taxes from nine to appoint set out out from a ... is any number looked in the background that people are producing a series I Believe\nThey have an agenda I Believe that was right there trying to prove a point\nI understand the role of groups like the Innocence Project in trying to make sure that the\nEvidence and the the er the facts of the case or iron\nClad that's really not how the justice system works you make the best case the best argument and then the judge and jury decides there's no absolutes you could have done things better in prosecuting they just absolutely\nShould they not have done some of the things that don't probably there's no perfect case\nBut I think the avalanche evidence suggests that was Steven Avery and Brennan death involved in this case and I'm Sorry I don't feel sorry for them it's a it's a big\nLeap from a Netflix series to saying Steven every or Brennan deaths you're innocent or more more comments coming in on the Facebook\nMaking and murder of post ah Cody guilty um you said that's what documentaries do there's a documentary and the prosecution side I Believe he was guilty of it goes back and forth so I mean there's\nYou can present a viewpoint on a on a Netflix series or any production really trying to make an advocate for a certain point of view that's what they do that's what the filmmakers have done you but to suggest that Steven Avery was railroaded or evidence was planted\nI I'm just not going to buy it shoddy work at some degree some level of the investigation perhaps you make some arguments there but again none of these things are absolutes\nThere was a as a case cried out for justice and I believe ... and her family got that justice\nWith the with the convictions Steven Avery and brand of deaths you know take more of your calls in tech snacks and also weigh in on Facebook at six twenty W TMZ on Facebook and and as as I said the accent where he's talking touch line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty more of your calls in Tex Mex on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay\nTo hear from Central America is making its way the U.S

you can vote throughout the rest of the day um some some comments on the acronym organs talking text line\nAs a former law enforcement officer I did and will not watch either of these programs the cases have been adjudicated hard to argue with that a mission sturgeon bay you might find this interesting people I Know in Florida who based or opinions solely on the show are mixed in their opinions\nI Know no one in Wisconsin was undecided guilty um let's see from the two six to\nWatching the series makes me still feel that he is guilty but our court system is embarrassing the way they handle that case that it's been a big criticism right the ... the somewhat shouting nature\nI'm appalled that case was prosecuted in handled and again there's no there's no absolutely perfect year things could have been done better that's the case in nearly every trial every case\nThe people that are that are working on these cases aren't perfect as either a perfect either but I think when you think about the every case\n... if I look at it from the perspective of all signs point to somebody who is guilty of a crime I see even neighbors face there and I don't shed any tears for him being locked up for the rest of his life\nOr from the two six to ... I was thirty six million reasons to keep every locked up after watching season was like I Can't stomach will do the Daschle\nAfter season to all things point to Bobby D assay Webb mode of an opportunity but the entire ab ...

W teams and cares raise the beam\nA today great interview with the uh designers architects of that uh the projects that will uh will do better nine thirty five eight forty five congressman Glenn Grossman will join us asking what is going to be the president today and ... sort of\nIn his neck of the woods a growth and then of course representing the Sheboygan area in the state of Wisconsin and I think any and it's a little area north and west of that as well of course the breaking news\nUh an explosive device found near the home of the bill and Hillary Clinton a chaplain claw home a song about one am by Secret Service and the FBI um they've lived there since they are the president has left office in two thousand and one uh wasn't clear if they were home at the time\nThis is only one day after device was found in the mailbox and democratic billionaire George Soros and his New York home and I asked gene about this to raise the question\nAs we as we fire up the emotions and the hostility immune civility related to politics in the lead up to the mid term elections in November six\nIs this part of the story we\nAll know there's people out there that aren't stable and they can't make rational decisions\nIn as a byproduct of all that hostility and instability pushing some people too chic these kinds of actions in this case building devices explosive devices neither sending them or dropping them off\nI've only had one say conversation of over met with President Trump says she was sworn in and I told them the tweets these are partly as tweets were not helping them and I do it I'm always in the uh all next time I see it might I plan on trying to talk about that with him again\nYou know the economy is doing very well I think he gets a lot of responsibility for that I think his cabinet is tremendous I think it's Supreme Court picks are tremendous he just necessarily hurts himself and quite frankly other Republicans\nBy some of these tweets I got to tighten it up you know and uh\nIt's a it's a frustrating thing because in so many ways I thought a very good job or if you know e unlike these other politicians he has a sense of urgency and way too many people in Washington they have no sense of urgency\nI think if you pay attention to it where he is on the issues compared to the average Republican I think most of your listeners will find is much more for the average guy in the average Republican that's funny I liked\nAbout do you say I Would use his you got to tighten up on these streets do you think\nHis message as you're in the midst of your reelection campaign is helping you are hurting you\nWell I think the fact that the economy is doing very well helping me and he's got he's got a lot of credit for that so in that regard it's helping me I think in so fires heat embellish does in his tweets or a is\nA little immature it is to eat because they're both Republicans and all I could do is say look\nYou know I have taken my time\nTo try to change that I've watched a lot of other Republicans around President Trump and they get all you know squishy and farming and even wants to know something is wrong they're afraid to to address the issue with Donald Trump and I'm not afraid to address the issue with them but uh you know we just have to uh appreciate all the good things she's doing\nAnd hope that over time I use it proved it in the last year out as much overtime kinda tighten up on what he says\nI got about thirty seconds with Wisconsin congressman growth ... do you agree as as a lot of people are saying the health care is the number one issue in the states are discussing\nUm health care and uh making sure we have enough people for industry I think the two things that you're about most our health care and you know my district has more manufacturing jobs now their district in the country I don't care whether you're dealing in manufacturing are doing in the medical field we have a shortage of people to work\nAnd if we're going to have this economy boom we have to have more people trained for the jobs are available out there\nIs always great to talk to Wisconsin congressman Glenn girls we got to get you back in Studio soon\nAbsolutely next time on Capitol dry\nAll right good to see us and thanks for coming on congressman yep I always wanted to talk to and I as I said there's a lot going on and we'll keep you up to date on the way to stories in the news is next Roger W ...\nGood morning Wisconsin night away you see with you on this Wednesday don't forget our show bull is on sweaters find me a WGN Jaycee the question [noise] Netflix is out with his second season\nOf the making of murders\nSteven every guilty or innocent simple as that you can weigh in on on the Twitter poll will do that every day on the show going forward so there's your opportunity\nAlso on us explain W changes to the page as well as a joining us now is outstanding attorney general hosted in Wisconsin brash image good morning\nThe morning the higher you good so you had a big meeting I think it was last night's or this week on the opioid and mess problem in the state what are we what are we learning about that problem is as all of us in the state of Wisconsin\nIt seems like we all know someone or nor salmon it's been affected by this what are we learning about it and how are we dealing with it\nYeah that is a fact we I it it will touch everybody if you if it's not your family it's somebody you know well and that that's true for almost every Wisconsin I [noise]\nWell what we have learned is that we have to work at it from a collaborative comprehensive approach to this forever we have gone after drug problems by going after only ... the supply side\nWhat it's never worked and we shouldn't have been surprised because as long as the demand exist somebody is going to spend the money or said with somebody is going to be willing to sell drugs to people who are willing to spend money to buy drugs you have to address the supply side and we are doing that very effectively as\nWe call hosted that event yesterday with the two U.S attorneys in eastern and western district of Wisconsin and local law enforcement with them walking police department and among others\nWhen we've ever work better as federal state and local partners but we also have to go beyond just than just going after the drug dealers we've got to address why are people using trucks and so this conference yesterday had over five hundred people and many of those many of them were healthcare specialist treatment a experts\nA victim advocate law enforcement prosecutors social services public health we had everyone together and we know that\nWe know that we've got to get more treatment in place for the people suffering we've built it in two thousand four team when I took office\nUm we had twenty nine counties with treatment alternative and diversion court programs in Wisconsin we now have fifty one\nAnd two tribal communities work ethic work to keep growing that for some of the smaller county it's hard for them to have the economy of scale to operate a core tired of the staff you need to do it but we're gonna we're we're going to keep working on ways that regional court so that we can get that available to every county\nWe've got to figure out why do people start using in the first place we know often times it is traumatic experience is people have as children mhm teachers telling me that by kindergarten and first grade they know which kids are going to be using drugs by the time they're in junior high\nSchool have never taken advantage of that knowledge before we are now going to take advantage of that that's why with our school safety grants were requiring schools and requiring makes it sound like they're resisting because they're welcoming test\nBut schools are now going to be training every single full time staff member in adverse childhood experiences of trauma informed care\nAnd then ten percent of the school staff are going to get adolescent mental health advanced adolescent mental health training and we're just safety intervention teams all of this is designed to when we identify those kids that are struggling to do something about it to get services plugged into that child and to their family\nTo make sure that they don't become the kid at in junior high that's using drugs or engaging in violence and acting out will be able to prevent more kids from using drugs will be able to prevent more kids from engaging in violence in our school all of that is going to make her city safer in stronger long term\nWe're talking to Wisconsin turned general read Simone W TMZ let me ask you about the story I read the other day about the DNA backlog I went to one did you get your take on why that is and what we're doing in the state of Wisconsin to address that\nYeah there's a whole lot of factors that are playing a role in this one of them is a year and a half ago the FBI increase the um [noise] there there are different locations on a person's DNA strand and the\n[noise] I'm trying to think of the right word here the past we used before could only we we can only passed with certain ... to a certain number of locations will now were you able to look at more low key\nBork only we we can only pass with certainty to a certain number of locations will now were you able to look at more location that gives us more certainty ... when we get a DNA as a result\nBut that increased the number of locations that are scientists look out by forty percent which doubles their work\nSo you're doing that we made it harder for them to produce the results we get better science we get more of a liability and that's a good thing but that they've increased the work we also saw we've also seen\nLaw enforcement better trained thanks for the work we've done it the OJ to collect more evidence so at crime scenes are bringing in more cases of evidence to help people guilty we've also expanded the use of our of our crime lab crime scene response teams we have one in all three labs\nThat go to crime scenes to help elect that really minute that really difficult to find evidence as a result we've got more of a protest in my first two years in office we saw submissions to the crime lab for evidence testing ... by ... percent ...\nThat's ... you can't expect your staff that was that was stretched all ready to handle that\nAre you going after additional staff thing and and and and budget dollars to deal with this yep\nYes we are now we didn't jump right to that because we first ... I transferred some other conditions from other parts of the OJ to the crime labs we also created forensic biology\nThat are helping keep the analysts that their desks or the analysts do their work and\nSome other scientists can do work that you don't need the analysts to do the analyst is the most expensive most valuable person that our lab they take a year and a half to train to do DNA work and\nThere there's a lot of competition for them out there in the private sector so they get poached from us so we need to keep them at their lab do at the bench doing their work\nWe also created some uh some forensic scientist that go to the crime scenes that we can keep again keep the animal is doing their work those things started to make a difference but we've seen that the submissions have continued to grow\nSo we hired and outside an outside source the national forensic scientist but you came in and conducted analysis of our lab concluded what we're doing was the right direction but we were going to need to tire more of those same people so that's what we've proposed in our budget submission that\nPolitical fourteen more of those forensic scientists in our labs that are going to do that work\nAnd the national Science Institute believes that that will that will resolve our issues\nLessening for yeah we're talking to Wisconsin attorney general branch him on WGM Jay the breaking news story the last couple of days is these explosive devices found that the homes\nThirty five she's pretty with you on this Wednesday [noise]\nHaving done every day this month [noise] some you can't drink cares\nRaised the beam Eric ... says project this month and now they've been they've been just great features and today it's no different than Eric I'll let you introduce our guest in the studio this morning\nSo we are trying to raise the beam of course this is the six foot twenty two hundred pound piece of steel from the north World Trade center towers that currently rests on the ground in the center of chaos because we went out and raise the be further nine eleven memorial that as you do see\nSo many other aspects of the story than just nine eleven and the victims itself the other the other aspects of it being the first responders being the U.S military the educational component there's so much to this memorial\nAnd what we're trying to do is help with phase one raised the beam forty thousand dollars would we'd love to do it by the end of the month and we need your help with that we will let you know how to donate and of course thinks the first thing financial center for their help\nIn this project is W. team daycares initiative so how do you build a memorial with so many different components so many different aspects joining us in Studio is Dustin males are used an architect of dusted and let you explain where you come from and all that and Peter ... with lax don't thanks guys for being here today\nA thank you very much Eric I'm I'm a senior vice president of architecture and construction with lakeside development company out of ... and I was approached early on in the project and asked to help and use my professional towns to to basically move the needle on a\nDesign have you ever built a memorial before I had not this was the first foreign so where where do you start with that process well\nI was actually a a given an artist concept that was developed by another ... high school graduate or David bears and Gordon and a year ago so who you've spoken with earlier this month or just asked if I were to help take this idea and develop it into a concept\nThat we could use for fundraising and get folks have visual on what this might look like some day\nIs it pretty remarkable and striking rendering which you can see on the website I deputy I'm Jay dot com [noise] when you think of raising the beam and having to point toward New York and all of that I assume physics has to come into play a little bit okay how do we get that in the year and make that work\nAbsolutely and that was one of the first the challenges that I face was holy cow this is a you know one ton piece of steel just over one ton and how do we support this so I reached out some of my professional contacts I'm an engineer\nAnd he gave me some advice as to what we might need to do in that it was actually possible because you get an artist concept that doesn't always translate into reality\nI'm so that was a that was one of the first steps in making sure this could happen\nAnd Peter what's your and how did you get about a dozen that asked me [laughter] ...\nHow we work together um I work for flights and landscaping around the owner and principal a landscape designer and so he needed that and so I volunteered to help\n'em and so then I came up with the the whole design of a site why was it important to be involved in the project well I've been out to nine eleven site and it was very moving for me and I\nCouldn't raise my hand fast enough\nWhen you see a different sites does that add some are either influences are there and pressures how does that work when you say okay I Want to replicate or at least you bring something to like here in ... there isn't the same in New York or Washington but also as a meaning in depth to it\nWhen I tried to do was using a monitor that you know never forget so instead of just creating a memorial we wanted to create conflict teaching center so you know they're Fifteen sixteen year olds were going to live when this happened\nAnd it's so close to us or me who are older but there are people that it's not\nSo in their face or in their\nUm so you're not just the consciousness as much as I said we went through it or were there when I heard about ... everybody knows where they were when it happened\nI'm teaching him how did you incorporate that into your design so and so what we did was I Would I Do is build it are designed a ring of of trees to inside that ring there's an apathy her um words race where people can sit and listen to someone talk about the event [noise]\nI'm In the middle of the um the circle is this Pentagon shaped desk\nI'm In honor of victims you know of that event and on top of that is wherever the beams going to stand so it's going to be very traumatic as people look at whoever's speaking they'll have they have been pointing at New York and will be very dramatic\nDustin when you first started to take part in this project have you noticed anything since then what what is raised your eyebrows what have you felt how is this gone as you've gone through this process\nUm for me it was it was just the awareness I mean I've been working on this for\nFour and a half years now and just getting out there and talking to people and uh you know young ... as you said before the younger generation that did not experienced is emotionally um there'll come up and talk to us and touched the beam and you know so let's tell them that they're going to\nBe enlisting and you know in the military um because they want because this war is continuing to go on today and they wanna they wanna help\nAnd um they don't personally my my stories that my daughter is nine years old she was actually born on nine eleven\nAnd she came home a from first grade with a book about the terrorist attacks and that just a you know sent chills on my spine that you know because of my involvement because this is in the schools\nUm in the community people are learning about it and they're asking questions about it and they're not easy questions to answer but at least people are talking about it and that's what's important to me\nAnd one thing we should point out ... as we raised this being one of the ... one of the aspects that I find so important is that you'll still be able to touch it correctly can actually put your hand on the beam even if in the air and for some people like tactical experience actually could help in some way as you try to comprehend what happens\nIs there's some challenges for either one or two years or some challenge we have something that's that\nBig and that heavy to to build it in a way that's one incredibly impressive that people have come up on it but also said for all the people that do come upon this thing\nI think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this in the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolating\nThere you can talk to how you isolated this in the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolated from\nWe have this ring of trees that surrounds the space and making it more intimate um\n...\nYou can surrounded by the states you're almost cuddled are held by it\nAnd the significance of the tree that we used that surround it as the pear tree I'm On the site there was one survivor tree after the accident which was this ornamental pair for kind of taking that as the symbolism of the rings around this whole space\nAnd then um\nAnd that again creates this kind of intimate space where you're not just out in this field and on and we want it to kind of having this kind of play the feeling when you're in that area\nHave you been amazed at how many different people more businesses or services have wanted to help with this just it it's amazing to me how many different aspects of the community are involved\nOh absolutely I mean when I was first asked to do this it was through a former band director it to us from high school and I thought I was just coming into you know offer my professional expertise which at the time was architecture [noise]\nUm but then it quickly evolved into this a huge community project in this little town in ... has this strong connection to New York um but as as things started turning in as we started getting a established as a Bible once you three\nAnd as a as a legitimate organization in the eyes of the community you have a flex do landscaping that you know couldn't raise his hand fast and all\nYou have growth design group that uh for their services to help us and particularly with what you guys have heard about from Jerry ghosts or earlier in the weekends and other community members that have offered their their income labor to help so it's really uh it's it's just the fabric of America that's coming together to help us build this project\nIt's got to be a great project to be involved with just the ones the the work that you do and how that ties in to the creation of this memorial to just the fact that you can take pride in something that you are you you put your heart and soul into and and that will be viewed by people going forward long a long pass all of us being on this planet it's gotta\nBe a great thrill it's wonderful to come up with the symbolism throughout the whole site and their little things we did um for instance a there was an oak tree that's\nSeven or fifty four inches from the center of the monument which is how many miles it is from costs come to New York and that is kind of in the swamp oaks is one of the folks that they use on the platform after nine eleven memorial in New York I'm In apple tree is really the ... remember Andrea who died uh\nOn on that day from ...\nIn one of the things that I Know the ... family Andrea's parents and her sister often say to is that it's not just about to off it's not just about the Harlem and family that this is so much larger than most of the Wisconsin nine eleven memorial I we went to your health\nWe have so many people that are involved in this but it's not enough we need some more help Steve so please if you have a couple of times you can spare Fort would four seven nine nine one six twenty if\nYou text the word tears C. A. R. E. S. two for one for seven and then when six forty we will send you back\nAdds to the intensity that the rest of the country has its it's true it's just there's a deep hatred or at least the a deep\nEnergy for lack of a better word between the two sides red and blue right now and it's always been that way but now it's more than ever before and just the rhetoric add\nTo that I think there's a case to be made that when you when you're going to the point where you were shouting down on people who are just going out to dinner with their spouses or their families in restaurants in public places we have escalated that rhetoric to a point where people can't they can't even function anymore\nWe all know that mental health and mental illness or an issue in this country should have surprise anybody and again we don't know the motives you don't know the background of Weber did this or are made these threats are sent these devices\nBut it doesn't there's not a big leap of faith to suggest that when you have people that are unstable\nOr showing signs of mental instability that they can go to the next level and that could be what we're talking about here and I think it's important to remember when you have conduct that rises to the level we've seen you mentioned Steve Congressman Steve squeeze you mentioned\nPeople not being able to even go out to dinner with their spouse because people want to threaten them in restaurants or the attacks and pronounced made by even elected officials towards each other\nThe rhetoric they use all these things contribute to the climate in this country\nIsn't it interesting though that you just kind of automatically assume that this is some type of domestic situation that we do and the funny though like we wouldn't have thought that a couple of years ago but now it's like automatically just assume that some praised lunatic from within our own country that's doing\nYeah I mean again we don't know anything about the motivation of this individual or individuals that are doing this but right now we look at the climate of the country it should not shock your surprise you\nAnd that's why I Will continue to monitor story or as I said you know how to evacuate their headquarters are there still evacuated or do you actually ... Jim ... a share on the streets broadcasting live on a on CNN right now um they were basically ushered out of their building the alarm went off to get out of their studio while they're doing a show\nAnd now they're broadcasting on the streets of New York heavy police presence as well I don't know the specifics of that of that the threat yet and we'll probably learn much more throughout the day are right here on WGM we'll give you the latest on these stories but explosive devices threats made White House the Clintons the Obamas the George Soros family and also CNN\nAll of those places being threatened by this story today so we'll keep you posted on that that is number one of our for at sand the four biggest source as we see the costs Milwaukee\nState and the world number two\nWe've talked about it before the Milwaukee health department now facing criminal investigation what does this all mean would break it down for you and that sort of each amateur video on this Wednesday on WGM Jay we're in the middle of our forests handle forget the have a chance to win more symphony orchestra tickets for\nA kind of a fun thing a holiday or Hollywood celebration the music of Hollywood but you got to get a rights or write 'em down if you have to be for as having the four biggest stars as we see across Milwaukee the state in the world number two Eric it's not a news story per se Markey health department issues with their their a\nResponse to the the lead water situation the ladder roles and the impact I'm walking citizens health but now pending criminal investigations into that department\nSo ultimately Tonys or Lenski had issued a press release we had seen it they they send it out to everybody questioning why Bevan Baker hadn't big subpoenaed\nAnd testifying before a city hall on the whole waters you with the health department Bevan Baker you may recall a had resigned abruptly not that long ago because of the situation where they were doing a lot of Bateman process properly there was a lot of issues with them or the health department\nAnd over the last few months we've tried to here I'm sure other news agencies have as well we've reached out to them Baker into his lawyer ... always get the same response back basically saying I Will let him know that you requested\nAn interview and usually that's all you've ever heard the ah so ... was questioning why wouldn't we bring him in here from the man himself for now only shanty handled in the Milwaukee common council president says the reason is because there is a criminal investigation\nInto the matter and that's why for now we have not heard from back in ...\nYeah and I'm On the underside of all of them and twenty so is he slammed the shots you handle decision not to subpoena Baker\nAny he issued a statement actually saying accused him of playing politics with the health and safety of our citizens delayed delayed delays seems to be the president's amounts of hair referring to president shots you Hamilton the real issue is transparency conspiracy and truth the citizens and families of Milwaukee desert so these certainly going back and forth on this handles and comes back\nAccused accused ... who ah who is already announced remarkably so that he is uh twenty twenty mayoral candidate a grandstanding here's one Hamilton said I'm not interested in wasting staff\nAnd council members time it's a great a spectacle that were ... nothing but an opportunity for you to grandstand on the issue I come down and so let's keep side here\nLet's get to the facts of the case let's find out what's who's responsible for the delays for the bad communication maybe in some cases the retribution that was raining down upon health department employees for not producing information not letting them tell people about what was happening in their departments\nBottom line is people can be affected by these decisions or lack of decision and lack of leadership\nWhether it's a shot the Hamilton are better than Baker\nI think Tony Phillips he's on the something here you have to ask this question let's get Batman bakers subpoenas we can find out what the real answers are I understand the politics I understand totally Lewinsky's throwing his head into a race that hasn't even begun yet\nThere's always going to be that when you're talking about elected officials doesn't anyone take a shot the Hamilton has some career aspirin\nYeah there's always going to be that when you're talking about elected official doesn't anyone to take a shot the Hamilton has\nSome career aspirations when it comes to a higher office Hans Mayer Milwaukee\nThey're not no one's immune from this but the bottom line is the citizens of Milwaukee deserve answers on their health and if you have any health departments and as someone who led that department the words\nAnd his conduct matter and that's what I think all of them and twenties was getting so we've also reached out to all of them is going to see if he wants to talk about this and I I don't think we've heard back yet but uh\nI don't I don't think that a shot the Hamilton president Hamilton is right when he says that someone is leaning on his leadership he's asking tough questions\nQuestions that should be asked\nLast thing from Hamilton we're supposed to be trying to respond a probably a properly to this crisis while you and your accomplices offer only criticism and conspiracy theories wrapped in misinformation that confusion so as you're a leader I asked that you excuse yourself from the\nTable when when the hard decisions are being made or I by God's will it will excuse you again that's ...\nI'm not sure where he's going with that and again let's let's mute the politics out of it let's get to the\nBottom of this and figure out what is the problem here who dropped the ball what we can do and how we can fix it classic Milwaukee problem\nPolitics overcoming overriding everything else not fixing the problems that exist get the politics out of its ultimate Phyllis ... and and the\nPresident Hamilton are both welcome to come on the show and give me their side of the story so that's number two of our Fort Sam he for biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the states\nAnd the world that little worked up on our on air but I think it's important that when you when the health and safety are citizens are on on the on the table I think we have to think about what we're doing number three more positive story brewers wrap up there twenty Eighteen season with a press conference yesterday they Stearns prayed council of bringing some of that next right here to be TMZ visceral\nRaces standing something for governor and US Senate John McHugh checked simulate Capitol reporter at five twenty Wisconsin's Ehsan ... of course three to six right here WGM Jay was I was watching\nThe world series last night between the red Sox and the Dodgers I Want I still hope to see and brewers would have been in that series for the younger watching I watched a little bit of it you know it's hard to get outta that baseball haven't once you have it and I watch them every pension every inning either in person\nOr on the radio or on TV or the NO CSI I'm kind of in that mode now so I watched about three\nOr four innings last night didn't really hurt you did it last night was that when it really hits you that's when it really hit me where I'm like\nOh so so I told Jean I was I was thinking as these situations were unfolding that game you know ... coming up price coming up what ... ... would have done in that situation and we went about it I mean\nSo you're still in that mindset and and it is sad but at least a there is some closure I we played the the great piece by our own one of our producers asked around him and the other day kind of wrapping up to the sounds of the season what was great to hear from David Stern counter yesterday as they kind of put a a bow tie on what was an incredible twenty teens\nSo yeah they held the end of your news conference at Miller Park stern says they have no regrets\nIt was a closer to one seven games and win series go seven days they're generally very evenly matched teams I thought these are two very easily matched teams and certainly I think both teams to say that they played well enough to move on I'm at the end of the day that the Dodgers played a really good game in game seven abs and and they deserve to go to the world series\nSo now we look to next year right Steve who is coming\nBack from a specific standpoint position all standpoint at the major league level we have the vast majority of our team returning\nAnd so I don't know that I Would point a particular area or two that we see that that absolutely must be addressed but there are going to be opportunities to improve our team in the off season we're going to work hard to take advantage of those opportunities and\nFor talking to Mike Nichols president of the badgering switch over here to take a quick break here we come back other issues facing journalism in in the era of Donald Trump and as we said dear the contentious Wisconsin election season that saw ...\nForty five minute with you on this whether they're happy [laughter] everybody forty six degrees at Radio City over\nThe place where you are thanks for listening as always we're joined by Mike Nichols the president of the ... Institute and we want to get one more thing about transparency or as we are talking about the advocacy journalism and just the press in general\nYeah I just wanted to make one more point I'm In the world is sort of heading towards advocacy journalism and let's have some transparency right I mean you have a W Madison is actually making any kind donation to an advocacy journalism group and decker ... stories that are running into can have papers but\nUh okay um you know connect needs a copy to fill a whole but let's be transparent about it and tell people who these folks are\nOr who are producing these stories that are running in the ... 'cause you never know that George Soros has given that group a million dollars um ... you know over until a couple of years ago they give them a million dollars you never know who the other funding sources are you'd never know that it's very very fair to characterize them as at least\nAt least left leaning if not just progressive so I mean let's let's let's have some transparency about about who folks are uh if you're going to run their stuff I don't see that and that is kind of it's kind of offensive is not um it's it's not it's not it's not ethical terms of the way in the way I understood journalism ethics\nYeah for for somebody went to school for broadcast journalism I understand what I think I understand what the rules should be of disclosure and being ethical are probably some of the principal tenants of that profession do you think consolidation of the newspapers you mentioned that grew up in and how that's all come together has that contribute to this\nI'm not I'm not sure about that I mean you look at their reach and it's still way down from where it used to be I mean sure they've consolidated can adults temp papers but I'm the journals down to a hundred and thirty thousand or something on Sunday that given that the you know given that the other Tanner are down I think on Sundays to a hundred and\nA fifty thousand total so I'm sure they're consolidating but by and they're and they're one voice now ah but you know they don't they don't they don't have to reach that they used to\nHear that somebody who who died just a lot of newspaper concept mostly on line it's interesting you go to all these different websites always papers across the state has all the same concept so he can really have an easy process I Want to ask you quickly about\nJournalism and the age of Donald Trump presidents\nWho uh is I I use the term uncharacteristically on presidential in the way he communicates and do you think that's been a challenge for journalists to kind of push aside some of the by especially we've seen some of the gym a ... of the world the Caitlin columns already announced that seem to have a running battle with the president\nHad well two things I guess it applies to Governor Walker's while there's a lot of criticism all their Governor Walker and the Trump mission and that is that is completely appropriate right and the longer somebody who's in office as with our current governor\nMore Christmas and he's going to get from journalists and as it should be so so criticism yes but when you have some New York times during the election that comes just outright and says that they see it as um if out their mission um\nYou know I guess part of their of of of of the way they're going to proceed\nOr to actually work against Donald Trump is actually what they did that that's that's that's not right or if the SAT on your editorial page I shouldn't be happening in the news pages so uh I mean I think there's a lot of admission that you have again some advocacy journalism going on\nBut it does it certainly seems like that a couple of minutes left with Mike Nichols from the badger Institute there's a great piece by Rachael ... W women's studies programs and or maybe they lack of ideological diversity going on if they hundred courses now\nRight offered right and a half to turn after ... page and read read some of these courses actually Steve I'm so you know simply undergraduate rather undergraduate courses at you W and the gender and women's studies program you know race gender colonization capitalism sex and power and\nGreece gender migration um the female body in the world uh\nYou know and then there's a we have a bunch of stuff in here about who to who the professors are and what they write but\nYou know the big question there you know if you imagine now there's one of the biggest women and gender studies programs in the country it's second only to another Big Ten school Michigan\nAnd or is this really is this really an academic discipline or is it activism and if it is a discipline should there be as much activism as there is there there's a perspective there and um I should we really be be funding activism uh at at at it with our tax dollars\nKnow typically the way our country works as things go in cycles are ways but in in the liberalization of of our educational institutions there's no there's no way there was no cycle it's just it's it continually ramps up when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting degrees and it's hard to be I'm optimistic about this\nSo when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting degrees and it's hard to be optimistic about the future of those institutions when you see that kind of course we'd be of course we're being generated there his tough we're\nTrying to reach out to you know\nA lot of kids there are there are there are kids who are fair minded now want to learn how open minded at U. W. Madison as hard as it is of leaders conservatives are there are all across this country and we've written we've written about it actually but uh yeah it takes some courage to be a conservative\nOr and smiles your views let it let alone turnout paper that you know you're progressive professor isn't gonna like Steve\n... Iraq Mike Nichols president a badge Institute I we met last weekend or ... or how can they find out more about your your publication beginnings and all the great stories that you do\nA sure so I can go to our website I get some ah WWW dot badger Institute dot org and you'll find it all their um sent me an email like a badger Institute ...

you do by golf course ... if you're around the world probably I Would\nBe that we all do hands line and and doing things like that I I I scarf and laugh at these people who say they're going to keep working I think ... you know you're not you're going to go in for two days and wonder what you're doing there the first mental you get asking you to do anything you\nDo you realize I'm almost a billionaire I'm not going to do that you know what my wife was\nShe just mentioned what you mentioned she would take all the extended family and we go on his massive world cruise and one of those stops will be Monaco at the casino which we would ya my wife and I visited him while you're there for the dollar ... and she says I'm going to hire George Clooney to play blackjack with us [laughter]\nShe was really specific I I'm I'm worried about the George Clooney saying now because she was very specific anyway mega millions we have a winter\nThat's really know how the justice system works you make the best case the best argument and then the judge and jury decides there's no absolutes you could they have done things better in prosecuting the case absolutely\nShould they not have done some of the things that don't probably there's no perfect case but I think the avalanche of evidence suggests it was Steven Avery and brand and death involved in this case but I'm Sorry I don't feel sorry for them\n\nIt's a it's a big leap from a Netflix series to saying Steven every or Brennan death your innocence uh more more comments coming in on the Facebook making a murder post ah Cody guilty\nHe said that's what documentaries do there's a documentary in the prosecution side I Believe he was guilty it goes back and forth so I mean there's\nYou can present a viewpoint on a on a Netflix series or any production really in trying to make an advocate for a certain point of view that's what they do that's what the filmmakers have done you but to suggest that Steven Avery was railroaded\nOr evidence was planted I I'm just not going to buy a shoddy work at some degree some level of the investigation perhaps to make some arguments there but again none of these things are absolutes\nThere was a it was a case that cried out for justice and I believe ... and her family got that justice with\nThe with the convictions Steven Avery and brand of deaths you'll take more of your calls intact snacks and also weigh in on Facebook at six twenty WGM Jay on Facebook and ... as I said I can I'm always talking touch land for one for seven nine nine one six twenty more of your

she's on the right track here just explanation on this survey as well Sam\nWhat's about that yesterday on the show I don't think he has a choice\nYou can't have chaos at your border especially a border that sees about Ninety percent of the drug traffic and human trafficking problems come to Wisconsin across the border like that can't continue and we can't certainly be made worse right now we're talking about the Netflix making them murderer season to season change your mind on Stephen every skills\nMy show poll a new feature on the program on Twitter find me a WGM Jay Steve asking the question guilty or innocent right now thirty three votes fifty eight percent guilty\nForty two percent innocence stays open for about twenty four hours you can go throughout the rest of the day um some some comments on the economic and talking text line\nAs a former law enforcement officer I did and will not watch either of these programs the cases had been adjudicated hard to argue with that a mission sturgeon bay you might find this interesting people I Know in Florida who base or opinions solely on the show are mixed in their opinions\nI Know no one in Wisconsin was undecided guilty um let's see from the two six to\nWatching the series makes me still feel that he is guilty but our court system is embarrassing the way they handle that case that it's been a big criticism right the ... the somewhat shot in nature\nI'm appalled that case was prosecuted in handled and again there is no there is no absolute zero perfect year things could have been done better that's the case in nearly every trial every case\nThe people that are that are working on these cases aren't perfect as either a perfect either but uh I think when you think about the every case\nYou if I look at it from the perspective of all signs point to somebody who was guilty of a crime I see Stephen neighbors face there and I don't shed any tears for him being locked up for the rest of his life\nOr from the two six to ... I was thirty six million reasons to keep every locked up after watching season ones like I Can't stomach but they did the desk she\nAfter season to all things point to Bobby D assay Webb mode of an opportunity but the entire eighty eight Avery clan bothers me or people who commit these types of crimes often repeats fact that we don't have another holiday tells me they got the right guy in the ... with the thirty six million bothers me\nI'm from the two six to watching the series makes me still feeling guilty but the court system is embarrassed\nWith the thirty six million bothers me a for the two six to watching the series makes me still feeling guilty but the court system is embarrassing me and one more from nine to old guilty but good example of of the end doesn't always justify the means so interesting conversation on Facebook\nOn our airwaves an online about the the ... even every case and uh as I said ... he's going to be guilty for as long as I'm Alive I see nothing and I've sampled season one and I will probably sample season too as well just to have a better idea of war that series is going but hum\nLoudly and clearly he's guilty of my mind's eye and after the news we're going to continue update on the latest on the explosive devices found\nEither on their way and routes or after the homes of George Soros and the Clintons in tropical in New York the Obamas and the work that's being done CNN was threatened or that's suspicious device was sent there as well causing a a\nAlmost a widespread panic as they were getting alarms as they were broadcasting a gym shoot into some of the other hosts how to actually the building them we're broadcasting from the streets outside CNN so there's a lot of uh information out there Eric will bring in the latest on that in a few minutes on the on the news coming out\nBut in a nutshell far when talking about something more technology related and\nIt has to do with a decision about a country\nAnd in this case is don't you Sweden but we've we've touched on that story here with ... with the company three square market and they have I think about sixty five employees now than it microchips imbedded in their hands between their summer for finger\nOne Sweden and this idea has caught on in a big way in some of the ways they're using this technology\nI think you're going to be a things there are some folks not all but some folks the United states are going to want to think about and constant place to make life easier I'll tell you what those things are the details how that works or after the news on friday touched on another story as well\nWe talked a lot about single payer healthcare on the show the other day\nWell I looked at the Democrats that are running in the house races across the country would be surprised to know that in half of those races\nThose Democrats are advocating for free health care for all that's an interesting dynamic as we look at the midterm elections November ... really voting starting already\nVoters trying to decide who to vote for a while if you knew of half the Democrats were ... were sponsoring or supporting free health care for all does that change your mindset to the independent voter voters that really matter in\nThis election does that make you give you pause\nSo I'll give us some details about that as well but we'll start as I said with the microchip story thousands of Swedes getting microchips inserted\nInto their hands who fought Wisconsin would love to weigh on that story but that's next to Jim bucks are starting to make themselves known by starting the seasons three whims and zero losses are back at it from five serve foreign for a nationally televised mess with the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers Ted Davis is on the call and our coverage starts at eight o'clock tonight bus going for for ... no\nI think they can do it here it already and to be GM Jay before it gets to the microchip story just the latest as we know it's\nOn the explosive devices story that we uh ... earlier this morning so here's what we know there was an early this week there's a device are located at the home of George Soros um the\nGovernment has the law enforcement has identified taxes and stuff to the Clintons and Obama's now this report that the DNC former DNC had Debbie Wasserman Schultz congresswoman from Florida her offices have been evacuated CNN's officers were evacuated the package some there\nWas apparently addressed the ex CIA director Brennan who has appeared on CNN\nOr the one that was taken from CNN has now are they screening facility to determine what exactly it is so this is\nJust the last three plus hours I mean this all started very early in the morning when I Am at the Clinton residents but the the public part of this was the last several hours so that the story is fairly fresh\nNot allots known other than the fact that these threats in these devices were mailed to former government officials are in some cases as as is the case with Debbie Wasserman Schultz currents elected officials or nothing about motive who might be responsible but I made the connection here\nWe've seen rhetoric and the violence ramp up from both sides and stuff on the left right wing white nationalist white supremacy groups on the rights\nDoesn't shocked me at all and we're seeing these types of stories play out and I we this may be completely unrelated to politics and the rhetoric of violence that's playing out but I may not be\nAnd will will stay on that story line as it develops but a lot of breaking news on today's show related to explosive devices\nAs what I said the the the one device removed from CNN is now at a screening facility and they will do try to determine if as was the case with the George Soros explosive device was rather crude and designed shifting topics and shifting gears slightly here\nAnd you can weigh in as well for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I Love this topic I'm Talking about technology\nTo begin with a well back early on in the town you are on my ten year on the um Jamie ... W teams we talked about what three square marketing company in Wisconsin\nWho had asked their employees are the ones the embed a microchip microchip between their thumb and for finger to ease the process of law games with the computer or buying items in their snack bar opening and closing some some of the doors at the facility\nTo implanted devices like unless it's a medical device rocky says no thank you Samaras says I'd be okay but ships to detect the cancer and other diseases early that's actually something that people are working on and from the two six to last word no do not want government\nTo get a hold of this is going to happen happening in other countries is happening in a small way in Wisconsin a three square markets coming to a a\nHand here you microchip instead of

us last week for different reasons but uh Mike Nichols president of the badger Institute is going to join me to talk about bias\nIn the media I Hope to have in the next few weeks or look at both sides of the equation Mike is going to present his side of the of the of the of the view that's\nWhat's happening in journalism in the state of Wisconsin is being impacted by some left wing groups where funding university\nOf Wisconsin Madison and some of the research they doing to er into journalism so we'll jumping event at ten thirty five and I as I said I Want to bring in a panel of journalists probably next week to talk about their side of of of what this is a debate looks like so that's coming up at\nTen thirty five at nine o seven he joined us almost every week attorney general Brad shovel there's plenty of talk about there as well\nThe other big summit last night opioid met some at dinner or there's some storylines about a DNA backlog will ask him about that and how his race is going as he prepares for another term as the attorney general for the state of ...\nStorylines about a DNA backlog will ask him about that and how his race is going as he prepares for another term as the attorney general for the state of Wisconsin uh they'll forget nine thirty five we've done it every day for the last few weeks or air built them WGM daycares raised the beam\nA today great interview with the uh designers architects of that uh the projects it will I Will do the nine thirty five eight forty five congressman Glenn growth will join us and ask them if he's going to be president today and those are nice and some sort of\nIn his neck of the woods a growth and then of course representing the Sheboygan area in the state of Wisconsin\nAnd I think in the ... and there's a little area north and west of that as well of course the breaking news uh an explosive device found it near the home of the bill and Hillary Clinton a chapter ... home\nA song about one am by Secret Service and the FBI um they live there since the the president has left office in two thousand one uh wasn't clear if they were home at the time\nThis is only one day after device was found in the mailbox and democratic billionaire George Soros and his New York home and I asked gene about this to raise the question\nAs we as we fire up the emotions and the hostility mean civility related to politics in the lead up to the mid term elections on November six\nIs this part of the story we all know there's\nPeople out there that aren't stable and they can't make rational decisions and as a byproduct of all that hostility and incivility\nPushing some people too chic these kinds of actions in this case building devices explosive devices neither sending them or dropping them off and homes of people they they would like to see gone and I I I may ask this later in the show\nIs this the the new age of violence when it comes to politics we saw in the Nineteen sixties certainly the fascination John Kennedy\nHis brother Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd you wonder if it's if that tension is being echoed today because of this inability to process the differences between people the understanding that we made different politics but doesn't mean we should hate each other so we'll follow that story\nA story line throughout the day of device founded the home with the Clintons in chapter ... about thirty miles north of New York city and uh as as details emerged we will cover that story for you right here on WGM J\nUh joining us in a few minutes we'll be Wisconsin congressman Glenn growth many debates was his opponents I'll ask him about that will I'll ask him if he's going to meet with the president in most any today\nI Know he's only only talk with the president a couple of times but it's a\nIt's an interesting race a lot of money being poured in he he uh his opponent has a lot more assets than a Glenn growth and as\nA green Grossman is a popular congressman out there in a very conservative districts so we'll ask them what is the outlook looks like having a November sick as early voting has been done and that's all coming up on the show today seems pretty with you on this Wednesday right here in Dubuque ...\nForty Morsi's really with you on this Wednesday [noise] joining me on the line is congressman Fleming growth and good morning congressman [noise] mind glad to be on the show\nSo are you going to uh meet the president's most any today by any chance\nWell we got to decide later today I don't know yet for sure um we have to change some other things out in the ... I may go up there\nAll right so your your opponents and yourself have now had a debate how did that though\n[noise] um well I think it was well I mean for those those paying attention to this race or frustrating thing is I think my opponent has not addressed a lot of issues he didn't address the last you know I think welfare reform is an important issue\nI think I'm not platitudes but we have big problems the current immigration system I'm not sure he feels the same way and suddenly it was kind of interesting I was clear my opponent\nCame out against photo ID and while that I Do not necessarily anticipate voting on that a federal level we couldn't the future have a Congress come in and say uh it's against the law federally to ask for a photo ID and got extreme position and I was kinda surprised that Dan Cole was so adamantly opposed\nA I felt that during the debate to a\n... a simple require produce photo ID something you need sometimes for for buying drugs as a you know renting movies that sort of thing and all of a sudden I saw that it became a little bit extreme\nThey're so on on health care like most of the Democrats are talking about the single payer health care did that come up in the debate and and I would have guessed that the your opponents are there and coal supportive of that the that efforts\nBy it it it kind of opposite leaves on that talks about you know bringing our Medicare and I don't know how we're going to pay for\nA medical care that we currently have if you have a lot of people to Medicare he clearly was a big advocate though for Obamacare initially and he was for a very big a government health care for ... years ago when\nHe ran for the state assembly a in Milwaukee County the last time I ran for public office\nYour district is a conservative district in and one that I didn't understand the issues probably maybe better than a lot of other districts so when you look at the race he's obviously the nephew of a former senator us a U.S senator Herb Kohl or he's outspending you correct\nYeah yeah I think he's outspent you'd probably two to one so far so it's a very scary thing I mean there's a reason why people try to raise money money counts for something like ... to to wind up on Green Bay TV maybe three ads for every ad I Am I supposed to be in a very precarious position\nDo you do you sense that people understand the fact that it really hasn't been in this district for very long\nWell yeah Phyllis ... he spent the last eight years of his life prior to coming home being in Washington and being a lobbyist\nFor some of that time in Washington he also doled out tax dollars to people so I think maybe this shadowy is job in Washington is the person who goes around collecting money he had to collect money from very left wing people then turn around and do all out ends up thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars\nThe candidate he was going out while overnight nine percent of the dollars he collected a turn them over to a democratic candidates are the very partisan a lobbyist up there and ah that's one of the reason why they will raise so much more money to be by the way he got\nHealthcare specialist treatment a experts a victim advocate law enforcement prosecutors social services public health we had everyone together and we know that\nWe know that we've got to get more treatment and plays for the people suffering we've built it you know for two thousand four team when I took office\nUm we had twenty nine counties with treatment alternative and diversion court programs in Wisconsin we now at fifty one\nAnd two tribal communities work ethic work to keep growing that for some of the smaller county it's hard for them to have the economy of scale to operate a court to hire the staff you need to do it but we're going to work we're going to keep working on ways that regional court so that we can get that available to every county\nWe got to figure out why do people start using in the first place we know often times it is traumatic experience is people have as children mhm teachers telling me that by kindergarten and first grade they know which kids\nAre going to be using drugs by the time they're in junior high\nWe've never taken advantage of that knowledge before we are now going to take advantage of that that's why with our school safety grants were requiring schools and requiring makes it sound like they're resisting because they're welcoming test\nBut schools are now going to be training every single full time staff member in adverse childhood experiences and the trauma informed care and then ten percent of the school staff are going to get adolescent mental health advanced adolescent mental health training or you know safety intervention teams all this is designed\nTo when we identify those kids that are struggling to do something about it to get services plugged into that child into their family can\nPlus requests store to reading going big

Jay\nRocky by the U.S ... each each other and the ad comes\n[noise]\nNick he's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Nikki how you doing\nAll right how are you great\nThanks say your dad's done something for you that you're trying to figure out if it's nicer not\nYeah yeah so what do you mean the background I was going to check on my credit score doing me a a a credit report and um I thought it was a hit another credit card in order to boost high credit scores on how to report\nSeems like they're the the credit card that was under county was counting on my credit score so I wasn't sure if that meant I should get another credit card like myself to boost high credit scores that one counted as my second one\nOkay great question so you're are you an authorized user or co owner of that account with your dad\nLeave I Am an authorized user\nRight so it depends on the scoring model an hour a credit card company would report whether that authorized users status would be a particular note for you I assume your dad's a great player and that's just good stuff for you on the report or neutral one or the other\nBut yeah yeah but you're working you're out there doing your own thing now\nYeah I Would much rather you get your own card another card yeah and then I close the authorize user status with the card you've had with your debt\nTo be a problem for me is a saline in Bay or\nYes if any if you are an authorized user and somebody doesn't pay it reflects negatively on you you don't have obligation for the debt right but there's a lot of credit Ryan fouls up your credit and I don't want you paying it in your credit report any more for your credit score\nOkay instead I'd like you to sign up for an account credit karma or credit sesame or both of them\nAnd you'll be able whenever you want to see what's going on with your credit to see a reasonable representation of your credit score every seven days for free if you want your able really to monitor what's going on with your credit\nOkay yeah so that they would ask me credit sesame and credit karma All right and a lot of people do both completely free for both of them excellent\nSo and then once you figure out what your next card is going to be are you the kind of person who pays your balance and fall every month\nOh yes I I wouldn't I wouldn't want to keep\nAll right then I Would like you to get a reward card if some kind\nEither are there any uh any you use us ... ... ...\nYeah so if you are how much do you think you charge in a month or two hours\nHow among ourselves and our you know\nAre out there and I know that card the city doubled cash\nCity double cash will\nPay you two percent cash back on everything you do and the other alternative is if you're a customer fidelity investments get there two percent cash back card\nResearch that points a different direction than prior research its methodology and it's people who have an agenda\nIn this case\nIt's the same exact people coming up with a different result so\nYou know one of the things in life is you have to be willing to have an open mind and recognize when what your beliefs have been and what they'd been set at those beliefs can be wrong and on this one\nAt least looking at one of the largest metro areas in the country the Seattle metro area\nI'm wrong\nWe'll see over time if in fact you do displace employment is wages move up and up you know we've had this big push around the country for which for two is the living wage which is a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage and I\nI have been someone who has felt that if you want to improve people's earning power you get to more skills you've got the more training and you create a better position for them and the work marketplace but it may be\nYou shouldn't for them and the work market place\nBut it may be that it is about re allocating the pie in a way that I have never looked at and never respected as possible looking at the pie as being a fix size I've never seen that perspective and now I say with all humility\nThat maybe there is some validity to the minimum wage\nTo you that may not be so big route revelation credit's been held depending on their mind for as far back as I can remember\nJosh joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Josh Hi Mr Gore Kerry you great thank you just plain old car can spot [laughter] yes see what's going on Josh\nOr so back in jail and Thirteen um I play for university football um they had me under full scholarship and during that first year or I received a back injury and\nOh I'm Sorry did it end you're playing career\nI was able to play for about two more years and then eventually had to have surgery and then it ended so yesterday\nYuck what position did you play\nIt off guard\nThe toughest you can be because people are coming for ... every single down\nYes there but it's all worth it [laughter]\nSo I'll let you know and I'm a junior high when I decided I didn't like getting hit that was the same position I played a payday laid right off and serve guard\nI played on the left side so\nYou obviously were much better than I was that you play through high school in three years of college\nI tried my hardest overdoses you will\nOr so from that I'm gathering something looking back five years is a hassle now\nYes sir Yes sir I'm hearing recently and she doesn't Eighteen um I went to go and check my credit score on experience\nAnd before I even got to see the credit score I saw to charges that were unfamiliar only a again our feet I was at a full scholarship um have letters stating that I should've been covered for tuition looks the whole bill\nFor the university should have been responsible for these medical charges that are from long ago\nYes sir okay\nYes it and so now I have called the ah credit corporation to see what steps I can take\n'em Dan so long ago and now the university has a whole new stuff so that makes it quite difficult to communicate with them um and it seems to me that they just course kind of drug defeat a little and\nWhat I gathered from the credit corporation is that um if even if I go ahead and just have this myself\nI'm it will mark the mark as hate them both for the next month but the damage to your credit score will ask for six years and all that much so\nAnd you're getting close to the end of that\nYes sir so\nUm as far as you paying a bill that was never your legal responsibility I Would recommend that you not pay\nOkay\nAnd not have any further contact with the collection agency odds are in almost every state in the country you're outside what sort of the statute of limitations and you can't be sued against that\nThose unpaid medical bills and but it is an obligation university had and even with the turnover and personnel I Would suggest that you make a call to the head of the alumni association or and or the head of the booster club for the football team\nOkay you know 'cause the ones that are involved with the booster clubs they are intense and they are very influential on a college campus and where others or a avoiding responsibility for a bill that belong to the university\nPeople in the booster clubs may be able to get the university to do what they should have done\nOriginally and should have hop to wants notified by you\nKnow is okay\nBut otherwise if the university just blows you off it means that when they try to hit you up for alumni contributions or they don't get those for you for a but it is as far as the bill let the clock run cars so little time is left\nOkay All right so\nA question just just to follow up the the actual money that is owed even after that term is up and it goes away from my credit score does that money stay on my head\nNo so remember as far as being on your head if you will once the time period in his past to be able to sue against the debt basically it's just a reputational thing which is what it is now and then that reputational thing ends at the they said six years eleven months\nAnd I've never heard that is the exact time usually out here six years now and her seven but anyway it goes away\nIt doesn't mean that at some point or was it was a scavenger collector may ten Twenty years from now contact you about it but you have no obligation in any way shape or form or fashion and it can not be used in any way to harm your credit wants to seven years is Ron\nInteresting okay\nSo you can rest pretty easy about this because the clock doesn't have much to Ron okay but if you want to try to get the bill paid hit the pressure points at the university\nOkay\nAnd best to you as one fellow offensive guard to another one who was good at the game and one who was not namely me\nDon's with us on the car coward show Hi dawn hey they're gone you have a question for me about credit let's see if I can be of help\nOkay so um I've got a good credit rating but I'm ... and not paid off my credit card so I'm feeling great about that\nThat that one credit card that's got a pretty large balance on it and I'm trying to find a maybe a credit card company that I can transfer that get from the higher one should maybe one with a zero a PR for twelve to Eighteen nice\nAnd giving me trying to head off the interest charges are astronomical\nSo there are fewer of those offers right now than there were a year ago and the reason is that interest rates have risen\nAnd it's costing credit card companies more money if they send a zero percent to you\nSo you you may find here or there is zero percent transfer but they act they often will ... interest in it within up front usually four percent of the of the balance you're transferring that they give you the twelve or Eighteen months interest free\nRight yeah I've seen that and I'm willing to do that said that I can transfer the ballot gay think that that's just not a good idea to take\nNo no that's a fine idea if you think you can kill off the balance in a year and a half if that's the offer been yes go for it because right now you're looking at an interest rate mid teens yeah\nYeah so if you take something from somewhere in the mid teens and you take it down to you pay up front I don't know what the actual and Putin interest rate would be but obviously a lot less than paying Fifteen Seventeen Eighteen percent\nI Would go for it as long as you down or certain you'll be able to wipe it out in the interest free period because the problem is after that period the rate send a boomerang really high on those zero percent offers\nYeah I'm confident that I can do that but um I don't know where a lot I see ads for things all over the place so I don't know you know watch on it it's not\nWell do you have a credit sesame or credit karma or both dashboard set up a yeah\nIs just as important as gas is so when

FDIC [noise]\n\nToday's car courageous moment is one of those things I\nAm so reluctant to even talk about it because\nIn our staff we talk about Wells Fargo fatigue but it seems like there's always yet another scandal that has appeared with Wells Fargo this new one is a doozy\n[laughter]\nJust a moment [noise]\nNBC News has been reporting in doubt about Wells Fargo policy with CDs is if you buy a CD with them even if you have the paperwork if you don't redeem the CD on a timely basis they will not honor it it will not pay it\nThey have the second day can destroy all records for CDs according to NBC\nSo that if you come in and say well I've got my paperwork slipped my mind found this in his safe deposit box or or my dad's getting kind of up and years and forgot he had this I Want to cash than forum or whatever and they tell you tough\nIt is yet another of the many reasons why Wells Fargo is a troubled institution that often I referred to as a criminal enterprise impersonating a bank and you should really think long and clear\nAbout whether or not you want to do business with them but the thing with the CDs the federal regulators\nAre solidly with the Wells Fargo were any bank that wants to set ugly rules on CDs that if you don't on a timely basis\nRedeem a CD and think about it for the bank if you have a five year see me and you forget about it and you don't go in till the eighth here they had you see your money for three years without having to pay you anything\nAnd then they go a step further and just white the value clear from you and keep all the money that is absolute\nThat is absolutely Clark courageous\nKeep records heat records keep records of your own\nAnd if you use an electronic calendar and you buy CDs make sure you know when they come do\nOne of the real important reasons to make them come to is a lot of banks will do a sneaky sneaky rotten terrible thing to you and if you don't notify them you want the money from a CD they will read up it into a new CD\nIt terrible interest rates that you're stuck with it as well but even that is better than Wells Fargo of ... with all the money [noise]\nAnd so no that whether you are cheap fame or fortune or whatever it is\nIt's never what you spend it's never what you make it's what you don't spend that counts living on less than what you make which is one of the models or this show\nIs the key I remember I had an employee years ago who\nAh we were talking one day and our lounge and another employee was talking about this guy who had this really fancy car and uh he must be rich and the other woman said one word and we just started laughing least\nPatrick's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Patrick Oak Park how are you today great thank you Patrick you got a bill shock\nA big bill shock what happened here well I got my\nWe know from my car insurance the other day and found that it had gone up sixty percent\nSix zero\nSix zero percent so we're both retired and uh we have excellent driving record so for the research that of course call our person that was found out that with a credit for and they raised me from a\nIce you probably know about this that bracket channel to bracket twenty 'cause I had my credit frozen\nRight they insure has the ability to do what's known so soft hit check on your credit even with the frozen so our insurer his let you down\nWell I'm sure I ranchers let us down and the other thing about that too\nIs that I go through an agent\nAnd she didn't know anything about it so she was talking to the company about this and they said oh we have to pull all three reports and we need ten days to this so either of course I'm afraid is all that good at airports so now I'm just waiting for the company that come back with another quote\nTo have you considered this company is providing such bad customer know service why don't you have your agents shop other companies\nAre eight and does shop or their companies but they were\nYeah but I mean right now while you're credits thought why don't you have your agent shop you with multiple companies right this moment where any company would be able to check your credit just like they're doing\nBut there were some the hair doing wrong and this and sure because once you're already their customer they are allowed to check your credit even when it's frozen so they're having something wrong administratively so while it is all I have your agent shop with multiple companies\nI contacted by credit in and they uh they do that too so that is a good a good call but I just wanted to inform your listeners that if you're going for insurance it could possibly be a hassle\nBut it should not be when you're already a customer that's the thing Patrick I wanted to make sure that I clarify here your insurer just did the wrong thing\nOkay and how would that be the end it sure is that my\nNightmare agent that is the insurer itself that is not following proper procedure winner credit freezes in place and as a result they rip you off and that is not Okay John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello John\nFor\nGreat thank you and thank you for your service to our country tell me what you do for a living John\nAh my wife and I both got out of that the lady last year for twelve years active duty and come to light fat and with a full time civilian slash reserve\nSo here you are having served our country for twelve years in a very dangerous time to be in uniform and now you continue to serve her well thank you for that how can I be of service to you after you've been in service to me and my country\nIf I'm a question was how to rock band I Would fix the work in a job and put in as little as possible I started out in February that a few thousand or a two hundred and fifty dollars\nAnd as of now it is at Seventy or eighty five hundred and eighty five [laughter]\nAre you [laughter] yeah so I I put a fifty three about fifty four thousand\nAre um when my wife and I got married and eat it up there are aphids the the maximum amount which I think was around four hundred and twenty a month\nAnd um they last year with the big wave and everything they're going down to a hundred a month but are trying to get it back up so my question was um I heard the name of your show here talking with the guy who had it on the army and you were talking about the um the\nS P and everything I Want to actually take my law school that over the last year the if that would be any better or or what\nYeah if they'll take the incoming of those assets\nHe would be to your advantage because the expenses and a T S P are much lower than even the lowest cost providers of a Roth IRA gotcha and then moving forward so you're both civilian employees of the department of defense now not contractors\nYet million employees so as civilian employees you want to participate as much as you can both afford to end the raw CSP because you'll get that plus you get a match as a civilian DOD employee but you do not have when you were in uniform\nThere are too is that you know I Am with regular CSP contributions novel offering if a male or a match up to ... it was um they're both my wife

October twenty seventh of Clinton good morning America as well what will we talk about today [laughter] ... he came in with no bandages so that was quite a week let's talk about that\nIt wasn't quite a week the U.S and the the selling swell continue the U.S it'd be closed down about four percent for the week Aztec down three point six small caps three point six an emerging markets for the first time in ages are performed by declining only two point five percent\nI think that's really important for our listeners this morning to to get through the who what when where and why of\nOf this correction and I think important leader is to look back at what happened with the S. and P. five hundred so far you to date going into October and it was a pretty healthy return for the U.S some ... five hundred and abroad and markets during the first three quarters and specifically the third quarter\nSnow was it was it was the best three quarter I think we've had in five years or so and right now we're having the worst October since two thousand and eight which of course remind folks are the scars from the financial crisis and the like\nAnd the other thing I'd point out too is on friday the S. and P. actually briefly touched\nAnd do what they call correction territory decline of ten percent or more a from a recent high and that number was uh twenty six thirty seven and it was interesting and it was almost like a magnet and the market didn't bounce off that pretty pretty strongly in fact we've got almost unchanged on the day and then just sold off into the weekend\nSo you mentioned correction I think it's important again to defined terms so when we talk about a correction we're not talking about a beer market and we're certainly not talking about a recession those are three completely different things\nA correction is natural and that's kinda why I'm trying to draw the backdrop of the return of the U.S and the five hundred specifically in the third quarter this correction for a lotta purposes was natural\nWith alphabet formerly known as Google so when you get highly valued companies that have had long runs and great performance that have really carry the big averages to to new highs it's very tempting for folks to sell and just assume that things can't get any better than this\nThose were the two big ones that I remember from this week we're Amazon and Google\nAnd probably impacted the markets the most on friday when you look at Amazon I mean you know big numbers I mean you know tens of billions of dollars in revenue and they're projecting a fourth quarter revenue in the holiday season around Seventy billion dollars and yet that stock gets beat up is that fair to that companies that company overvalued\nIt is I mean you know in our quantitative work Amazon has never scored particularly well but part of the reason is the reason Amazon hasn't made money is they've been investing so heavily for infrastructure anybody who drives up from Chicago and looks for the right see that massive warehouse that was built several years ago\nThat's one thing the other thing is there other companies did report gray numbers like Microsoft report a good quarter a intel report a good quarter despite fears and started to get their space that\nDouble ordering it's occurred in the like so the fundamental backdrop is still pretty positive you know it's just a case in my mind of a long overdue correction some complacency on the part of investors and the realization that\nStocks just don't go up every day\nTo the GDP numbers that arrived yesterday before all the excitement on the street how do you decode that mark I look at that you know you look at companies and the fundamentals and evaluation\nBut then the other part of it is how is the economy doing and GDP is there a measurement of growth of the overall economy in that is business spending consumer spending inventories all of those are subsets of GDP so in that number came out on friday I thought it was a healthy number for a lot of different reasons not just because it was three point five percent\nIt was a healthy number but again this is what investors are dealing with when the GDP is growing headed above a well above average rate stocks don't tend to do that well stocks do best when GDP is improving either from a negative or from a shallow positive\nAnd the thing about this recovery is it's almost the longest economic recovery we've ever had but we don't see the access as we don't have the inflation IPO's born all this other stuff you know I Want you to market top\nOn I think you're right because that's what you mean by helping number a three point five percent and the expectation was three point four was new drug lord number nor a disappointment\nAnd I think if you you know blow number then the idea that the fed is going to step in more quickly to raise rates would be a damper against stock prices on the other hand had we miss a number of you'd start to think that the the economy is slowing faster than people who had realized that the perception that the economy is slowing\nMaybe as more true than we might believe so I thought the number was healthy for a lottery so\nIt was a it was a good number of there's no denying that but it didn't affect the market at all it didn't beat out the Dow is down three hundred before the number it was down five hundred after the number of than it was an changed after the number and then it finished down three hundred at the end of the day or because you were watching I was watching and well like you know actually uh to to to be totally candid\nUm we actually put a great deal of money to work on friday reduce some of our fixed in upcoming exposure head at some\nActively managed mutual funds and

end of the year about buying dividends and what people have to look out for to hang in there for that part of the conversation but just back one more time to to the markets the fear and greed index and the VIX let's talk about those two things because it's a measure volatility it's a measure of perhaps opportunity\nYou have the fear and greed and excess back below ten I didn't bounce somewhat a couple of weeks ago and historically when the fear and greed it slow ten you try to look for opportunities pockets of strength perhaps a washout into things like emerging markets energy stocks and the like ... and really just have an even handed approach\nLike ... and really just have an even handed approach the one thing about the fear and read it acts that I particularly like 'cause it's not just about stocks looks credits spreads volatility the ... you mentioned the one area within the fear and greed and expense held up the best is spreads\nSo the the fixed income guy so I think to a much better job assessing the economy in the stock market pronounced ... they don't see a recession if they did we'd be seeing spreads whining and that's the one thing we need to avoid an order roommate

that's\nHow they do their thing that is correct interesting though since twenty sixteen hundred and twenty eight cases have been filed related to fund selection an oversight of four one K. plant in the headlines of both you and I saw it in Barron's which is a bona fide publication fund companies got sued by their own employees over pricey four oh one K. plans\nYou break that down and there were some big names in there\nYeah yeah all of these would be recognizable name\nA good thing about the headline of this is that it said that they got sued over pricey for our own K. plants once you drill into the article it talks about how their self dealing a mutual fund company provides its own four one K. plan and there are their own funds within that plan that isn't the biggest concern is that what were they charging their own employees\nFor those products a lotta people criticizing oh hey you loaded you're four one K. plan up with your own funds well\nIf you believe in your own product and you're selling it to other people you should be willing to to use it yourself as an employee of the farm so I don't see that as the big issue the question is how much were they charging for the next four O. one K. and I looked at it I've got fourteen funds not one is the Voyager and void does manufacture mutual fund investments so\nThat's part of what we do is we go through and look at as a team which investments arena offer we love voyage the chassis\nBut when we looked at the lineup unnamed bail options we just made the determination that we can\nFind some other ones to fill those slots people see this article in Barron's is their teeth to an article like this a lot of these lawsuits don't have tons of merit when you look at these these are about law suits that have been filed there have been no judgments issues in the case of the ones that we're talking about here when I look at these the reason I wanted to talk to you about that says\nThere are a lot of good people in this industry is this industry perfect no none of them are but\nThere's nothing wrong with a company offering its own products to its own employees\nYou just want to make sure that it's being offered at a

the financial services industry my whole career I think there are a lot of really good people in this industry people need to be careful yeah they got to look out there but this blanket approach to making the financial services industry I always look like it's after people it's something that I just take personally I don't like it\nGo to Tom parks director retirement plan services antics wealth management swallow employees asked for their four one K. plants\nThe easy way to think of it is if you're participating in a far on tape when you'll know that it's a good plan if you understand how it works you have a sense of someone there to advocate for you to go about this investment selection process so you're going to have lots of different investments to choose from and your plan is there is someone there to help you figure that out what's the right mix and blend for you\nAgreement and this really when you are charging somebody especially when there is no arm's length which means you know they're your family right\nThere sentiment there's emotion involved that you're always best coming in with an agreement and we advocate a written agreement sit down and write out expectations on both

I'm Danny calling it's time for ask antics and we would love for you to submit your questions at ... dot com slash ask and that's where this one comes from Joe Martin estate planning attorney from antics wealth management you've had three of these this week I have a right let's get to it what are the tax consequences\nOf giving your house to your children to avoid having it quote taken away\nAnd then what happens if it needs to be sold while you're still alive so kind of give us some context they're\nSure so multiple components of that taken away is where we're trying to plan to make sure that the value of that house and they have to be spent down before someone qualify for Medicaid you have to have certain asset qualifications and income limitations the free qualify for Medicaid which is the government program for a long term care so what people do is they planned to try and\nMake sure they're stating assets are ensuring that they're going to go to the next generation so they don't have to be spent down prior to that\nSo let me put that in contact so my mother today is he coming up on an eighty one next month\nEvery birthday in advance and you know she owns two homes\nAnd one here in Wisconsin one Florida that she brought along with my dad when my dad was still alive so the question would be in the event that she gets sick Joe and the event that she needs to go into a long term care facility or even if she needs care at home she wouldn't be eligible to do that until she would spend\nDown a certain amount of assets I think people perceive that

program you're listening to the red that'll show it's the truth about money I'm very happy very excited to welcome forty new affiliate radio stations to the ... show we're now broadcasting this program to eighty five\nRadio stations across the country or this program as the longest running national personal finance radio show in the nation are talkers magazine has ranks me one of the top one hundred talk radio show hosts in the country\nAnd the number to talk show host that airs weekends only uh so we're very excited to be welcoming all of you who are listening to the Rick Edelman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're going to be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or ... and our organization uh we manage a a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a Barron says ranked hour from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients and I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock market and this past week\nVolatility has returned\nAnd although the numbers look rather shocking you know with the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday dropping over six hundred points uh that's nothing compared to the fact that the Dow is at twenty five thousand before the drop occurred\nAnd that's really the the key point isn't it is that we can't be focusing on the point drop\nWe have to look at the percentage drop\nBecause we put it in that kind of context on a percentage basis the drop really wasn't newsworthy wasn't all that material but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week\nYear today the Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent\nThe easy index which is the index of foreign stocks that's the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the down yes and the and the ISI are down one percent one percent twelve percent it's actually even worse than that\nThere are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them are down ten percent or more from their eyes civil though the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them\nAre down ten percent or more in the S. and P. five hundred the absentee itself is down one percent for the year\nBut eighty percent of the S. and P. five hundred\nOr talking four hundred of the five hundred stocks\nAre down ... percent or more from their hides in the ISI Ninety percent are down ... percent or more from their hives and the NASDAQ\nEighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more from their eyes so if you look at your market performance recently you will see some pretty substantial declines year to date it means that\nWe have had all the profits accumulated so far this year from January one for September\nThose gains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one do you have to be done on the iffy down twelve and it's not just limited to that gold is down six percent here today\nThe real estate market as measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index down four percent\nFor the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up all of them ... percent\nDemonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything always goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that will be we don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a big\nBet we diversify we diversifying two ways we diversify among classes yes she won't socks but yes you should also I'm ponds and you should also on foreign securities and you should also on commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you break one you gotta love and left that's the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you buy as many stocks as you can notice I said that in some ... five hundred the index itself is down one percent for the year\nBut eighty percent of the stocks have lost ten percent or more in recent weeks\nEighty percent of them are down ten percent in just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point set of trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're better off owning a market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear\nActively managed mutual funds\nMeaning mutual funds that hire professional manager whose job it is is to pick stocks that will beat the market\nThey have a dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail to beat their index they fail to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks mid sized stocks are small stocks rose stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign stocks doesn't matter it also doesn't matter what time period you look at you can look at your date you can look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThis data is consistent\nFund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager that does succeed at feeding a market that manager is unable to duplicate their success so while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick\nThis year the manager that did best last year\nThey're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nMaintain a long term perspective focusing on knock the market not politics not policy not the fed but focusing instead on your\nWhy are you investing in the first place what are you trying to accomplish is it to get a kid into colleges have to prepare for your own retirement is is take care of aging parents wire you investing that determines for us\nHow much money you're going to need how much money do need to achieve those goals how much will college cost how much will your retirement costs how much will cost of care for mom\nOnce we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we can work backwards do some calculations to say here so much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning\nHow much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning and in order to get that return at a reasonable expectation here's the investment strategy here's the mix of investments they asked about location necessary so that makes sense\nIf you're not approaching your investment strategy in that way you might be doing it wrong and that's why we encourage you to focus on it in that way if we can help call us a triple a plan wreck\nThat's AAA seven five to sixty seven forty two we make it

their ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you act financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what the ... ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us we'll sit down with one of my colleagues here at the farm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an

than we have people looking for jobs which doesn't seem to make any sense right and if everybody was looking for a job and there are jobs out there how come we don't have a hundred percent full employment\nMaybe it's because the people who are looking for jobs don't have the skills that are required for the jobs that are available in other words we're talking about career development\nIs it possible\nThat despite the fact the economy is strong your job might be threatened due to exponential technologies particularly robotics and artificial intelligence is it possible your job might be

cabdriver and you can sell your medallion if you felt like it\nBecame a market where people were buying and selling medallions the value of the guardians rose really fast and New York in the audience here at one point three million dollars in value people were getting rich trading medallions\nThen came along over\nNew York city medallions fell from one point three million to a hundred and sixty grand in Philadelphia the medallions fell from half a million dollars to ten grand\nThousands of cab drivers around the country have lost huge amounts of money in San Francisco there has not been a single medallion bought or sold in more than two years which means they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in

I don't know the size but can I go to these Web sites and download 'em and and you know my non eternity experience has been those documents are problematic a little bit generic walk us through some of the issues with those kind of pre populated generic forms or if you will\nTo the health care power of attorney form there actually is a good version that the state has created out I Believe it's on the department health and family services website\nOr a physician can give you a copy of it\nAnd it the problem with that particular document is if you don't fill it out correctly it's not going to be valid so\nWhile there is a good form and that good a sample that you could use for the health care document if you you know you don't sound out correctly and you don't know that you didn't tell us what correctly it's not going to be valid once again once you have now become incapacitated and you're not able to fix it\nSo it's not so much that people can't find ways to do it on their own it's just in the execution of it you don't have it notarized correctly if you don't have the proper number of witnesses whatever it might be anything that throws that document and being in palate invalidate the whole document so that's really the problem with using one of these template so to speak\nI Believe that the power of attorney for finances recently that if he does count and also create a standard form of that that that one is is even more complicated than the house Caroline so\nYou know I I Do these documents in conjunction with doing larger statements typically for people and I can do just the power of attorney but there it's really not expensive and it's so much better to have the peace of mind to know that they're done correctly so that when you need 'em you know you put the plan in place and it works\nYeah I get that question a lot of people say you know can I Do X Y or Z and I said look if it's important to you and your family are assuming it's legal for us but there's almost always a good ... good attorney can do that and I know some sometimes in the financial par returning to or no we've run into your shoes where\nYou know it's too limiting the power

planner would drink an associates wealth Wisconsin dot com got a great topic we're kind of we went through the complicated fog or you smoke and mirrors murders of estate planning you know I think there's a lot of misconceptions and\nUm go to great team here to there got bread Allen of course and we're joined by justice week attorney ... little ... who's a lot of work in the area of\nYou know elder law planning and wills a stage trust things of that nature in there I think there is always different goals that people are trying to accomplish so\nI I guess the prescription for what the other state plan might look like is going to vary quite a bit depending on the outskirts and what you're trying to accomplish and\nWe were talking briefly about the importance of the powers of attorney documents and you know being something everybody should have been also there's also will living well can you help us navigate the kind of complex issue or is this where those questions come up and none of us want to answer those aren't comfortable and\nSome of it yeah um you know in most frequently when I ask people you want your beneficiaries to be but not it it's who you would logically think anyway so they're really frightening about nothing but\nYeah there is confusion about the well versus the living well so when I was going through the basic components component of basic estate when it's going to be asked to power of attorney document and not well everybody needs a well really regardless of you know what you have for asked that he might have trust beyond that but\nI'm the well as the basic distributed document that you can have\nA living will is really an auxiliary documented healthcare part attorney and it delineate further instructions on how you would want your healthcare handled so if you knew you had a terminal illness for example and you didn't want to be put on life support or you never wanted to get dialysis there are some some specific\nSo these are all those like do not resuscitate on on life support those\nDirector of those things are factored into the health care document worker living well it's it's not and in the south of power of attorney had not enough it's not legally binding it's really just meant to be done to make the will to health care power of attorney that gives further instructions about\nAnd it's not the end of the world appropriate but it's it's definitely more congressmen and time consuming and typically more expensive because you you'd most like to have to hire an attorney to help you navigate that required but it's it's more than likely you're going to have to at least consult with an attorney to go through the process\nSo that's where some of the expense comes and that you may or may not have with someone who is able to be a more informal trusting our to handle your state\nAnd I'm Sorry go that's a pretty long process to right when when you go through pro rated I mean\nTypically twelve to Eighteen months it's certainly could be shorter but again I never had someone said to me while that probate was fast and I can't impress on people enough when we start the process that it's it's a bit of a ... at the time consuming process and inevitably around eight or nine months I Can't believe or have done with us yeah it it just if not quick\nThat a lot in the news when celebrities pass away in the process is really long and\nYou know people start coming out of the woodwork a little bit right yeah and we certainly seen a lot of those big cases but I I think the trucks can just be a great way to you know

really couldn't have direct access to the money for their health care benefit reasons and\nIt's another one that just for a number of reasons wouldn't have been great to have access to lump sum of

Wisconsin dot com and we got one brother was actually about two weeks ago that was in particular I think it on this topic\nYeah I you know a lot of people come in the office and one of the things that are worried about is is long term care you know at the nursing home coming into play nobody likes to talk about it but it is a conversation to have\nLong term care insurance can get expensive a lot of people or or maybe I'm Out of the range where it makes sense anymore so what kind of things or can we do to protect the assets after protection or in retirement if they were to go into a nursing home or long term care\nRight one of the best tools that we have to protect athletes is doing an eerie though a couple of trust so this is different\nFood and water and out here now here Vogel board ...\nTrust which again has so many misconceptions about people feel like you're you're putting your money at this place and this and this guy is in charge of it and it's really not the case it's a very misunderstood at ... you know planning to all that the goal of it as a white probably but it also protects the asked that\nWe always have to contemplate the five year look back period for Medicaid so if you are intending to do some asset protection your best off to do it\nMore than five years from when you would need to go into the nursing home\nSo that requires is to have a really clear crystal ball which isn't the case so you really it's kind of like having homeowner's insurance in case a tree falls on your house I mean you could you not second unique good if you go and get the homeowner's insurance today after a tree falls on your house so\nI encourage people especially when they're nearing retirement and I look at doing estate planes this really who that target\nTo evaluate their assets are their assets they could protect at that they want to protect and really just a question of what what's your goal you know I tell people that you come I'm going to educate you on that I'm gonna ask you what your goal is if you take your goal and asked that protection as one of them than I can help you make that case\nI don't want people to get I'm confused and bogged down by some of the nuances of how that takes place I really just want them to be able to tell me in a perfect world this is how my assets would be protected and this is where they would go to and I will make you know that happened but um so ... it's a really great planning tool in order to deal with\nAsset protection so that you're going to a nursing home you aren't forced utilize all their private have find really until you're down to quite a minimal amount of money I'm left and then there's the house the car and you know sort of my cash assets but even the house if you don't have trust the community south gets to reside in the house\nBut they'll they'll put a lean on the house for any care that was received by the institutionalized spouse that that's the case so you don't really get to keep the house as you hear people say you get to live in the house until such time if you can't and then that means we'll be have to pay back\nSo fair to say we don't want to wait until it's happening wherever we want to stay ahead of this or ... one of those things are are appreciated about Ashley I'm sure hope those those are wrong but I'm you know ... ... ... or you know for folks over to her as", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "27"}
