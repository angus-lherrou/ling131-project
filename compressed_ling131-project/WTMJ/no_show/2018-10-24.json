six twenty that has the accident mortgage talk and tax line I'm Greg magic this is Ford central presented by Miller Lite check you out on Twitter at G. mat sick or find me the email Greg dot map ticket WGM Jay dot com [noise]\nA lot of notes on the text line with regard to your Milwaukee Brewers and Green Bay Packers and interesting bucks notes is well from Tanya in common are\nHard to argue with you about quarterback Hey Greg I wasn't Rogers on his first contract making like twelve million a year back in twenty ten now are paying Adams fourteen million ... million grant and million Rogers thirty three and a half\nMatthew ten million and so on and so forth\nAnd not really get into production from the majority of them\nNow if that situation you run into its [noise] hey this is my teams light to remain young then\nI mean I get it so [noise]\nI I went through the Los Angeles rams contract situation Jared golf is they find young quarterback in this league and he also happens to have a really a dolphins of mind as his head coach maybe the premier office of mine in the NFL you're showing McVeigh was like thirty two\nNow to the point where coaches GM's of everybody's younger than me though [noise]\nBut ... golf is making under seven million a year [noise]\nAnd that's like backup quarterback money it's just really contract and he's going to be do a payday as soon as that rookie contract expires but six of the top seven paid players on the Los Angeles rams play defense I mean you can't do that if\nYour quarterbacks making thirty three and a half million dollars you cannot flood the top of your salary cap with guys making that much money [noise]\nIt it it's not unlike the brewers situation here right asking you talk about starting pitching waiting curse also thirty five million dollar man on the mound tonight oh okay you're the brewers can you afford that kind of guy who may be but who the heck out there you go to pay so you get into that situation where maybe we find a value play was starting pitching and stack are bull pen\nOkay now translate that to the NFL maybe you'll find a value play or a young quarterback who you really believe in your number two or three in the system still wanna rookie contract you feel like you can perform a veteran making a lot more money and then you stack your money on defense\nWith guys who were going to make less than any quarterback in the league but still be incredibly valuable and among the premier players in the NFL\nAnd then as we've seen with the sea hawks and now maybe we'll see what the rams there they defined window though that those teams that have to learn and like you were talking earlier until the contract at science\nIt it really does make I think the Packers run to the playoffs another decade plus they were going to the playoffs every year that really is remarkable given that they've always had a pretty highly paid quarterback Rogers was three years and I think yeah maybe one year on that rookie scale than they renegotiated then he got into this\nWell the scale and they renegotiated and then he got into a pretty big money here but I I went through the numbers here so you're on your top scoring defenses in the NFL scoring defenses these defenses are giving up less points than any other team in the league in order Baltimore Dallas tendency Los Angeles\nSeattle instilling those your top six okay Dallas is paying back press got six hundred eighty thousand dollars this year number three Tennessee Titans markers Mary ... making six million dollars a year number for the rams Geron talk\nMaking under seven million a year number six Philadelphia Carson was pretty good six point six nine million dollars a year so six of a top aide scoring defenses in the league are paying their quarterback under seven million dollars and they're all pretty good\nBut I really hope the ... would be cleaner in all aspects in in that it goes really I I think directly to the passing game where it's ... it's still kind of a turnover frenzy at times for the passing game and I had hoped it would just sort of picked up from that ball game against Miami and you know hit the ground running this year\nBut all aspects of the fence it it it hasn't quite been there why is that you believe\nYeah that's a fair statement and I think they're still trying to figure\nOut why it's a a I think it's a good solid our fence of wine um and and if we're talking college football or the NFL the quarterback position gets\nUh the the lion's share of the tenth of of attention in a positive way or a negative way and the last couple of games up our taxes are thrown some picks it's kind of last year's\nBad Alix has reared its ugly head which really had not been a part of it\nThis season until these last couple of games against Michigan certainly that's a very very good defense that was able to tee off as the game went on\nA couple of throws last week that one may have been a bad route that miscommunication but it's just been inconsistent group at its best it has been very good it's been able to control the ball it's been able to get enough big place\nBut the problem is you hear it doesn't matter if you're talking\nA if it's great council talking about the brewers are Mike mccarthy about the Packers are\nAny coach or a manager anywhere you just want to see more consistency in that office just hasn't been able to click despite the fact that Jonathan Taylor remains on a pace that that has been putting up numbers that he put up last year which were ridiculous\nAre you still have one of the best players in the country and you're in your tail back and good death behind it but the consistency and the passing game has been what they had hoped\nThat do you think the badgers are playing for a big tent title in Indian December\nRight it can be sure but at the same time is it to wishy washy answer here but uh you look at their schedule especially the road games are all pretty ... northwestern with Penn State and Purdue all out there but I I still think I Would like to think that if this team is at its best or near its best\nIt can still be the best team and the Big Ten west but I think what we're finding out as I've mentioned\nIs a ... to do in a very good job at Purdue Ohio State found that out first ... at first hand northwestern is a very good solid program saying with the Iowa it's just not the cake walk that may be a lot of us mistakenly anticipated it wouldn't be at the beginning of the season\nOne more before we let you go and that you're about to begin the basketball football fancier very effective at it on November ... I'm I'm very much looking forward to this badger season if only because of how they finished last season holding some quality opponents are under their scoring average\nIt feels like the defense of system with the badgers and in the Big Ten when you have young players take some time will they sold what they could do in that system last year and it it might be a return to badgers basketball from six years ago a but I'm looking forward to the growth here for the team\nYeah that's a it's a great way of putting it in you hope that it's a healthy team which was something that they were not last year but you have Dimitri tries to is back up and running Kobe came back up and running\nBrat Davis and with two healthy shoulders a BP can go right down the left now with the drivel which we weren't able to say that about him for most of last season the rotation guys return from last year and with more with better health\nAnd more experience you would think that this team is set up to be\nBetter there's been a huge defense event or a emphasis in the early stages of their camp um but I Want to see this thing and be healthy enough to give itself a chance and you're right the way they ended last year was really really impressive when you're having a bad year\nItch really tempting to phone it in and get the spring break but this team played its best ball late from the middle of February on and you hope that there is a carry over there that they know that their past\nThey're a very competitive team and then they're going to need to be losing is something that goes on much around here and they're not ready to start it but I think we're all year to see how much better these guys are this year\nGreat stuff ... years the voice of the Wisconsin Badgers and met with pale be on the call this weekend when Wisconsin takes on northwestern thanks for your time that I was the president will a second again down the road\nAll right Greg sounded good good talking to you\nAnd that is the voice of the measures that is one that ... pay the the college football playoff committee or are we done at this now did they already revealed the top five in college football playoff world it was supposed to happen tonight you're talking about things being overshadowed by the world series I completely forgot about this is it out yet\nI don't think it's out yet I think they're going along though I think last year compared to go there like eight o'clock and then you're gonna wait 'til really alright well we'll dig on that and I don't expect the bad and to be anywhere near the top five and we don't get me wrong here but\nA kind of curious curious to see ... seats up especially with Ohio sneak getting smacked\nThousands of people to watch sports that those presented by Miller Lite if you're looking for a nice place to have an ice cold Miller Lite\nStuffing by major goals these underway to a game or Sears into those are no better way to celebrate a hundred and seasons of the Packers then was an ice cold Miller light or central continues after this and ...

in Wisconsin we enter a new era the inaugural season for coach white ... and the first season of sparkling new vice or forum coach welcome to your new home and thanks for joining us\nIn the past few months use of this job you're with them all the boxes the coaching job you really wanted obviously knew about the armistice potential but what else did you see that convinced you to make the leap to Milwaukee\nOr you know I I saw raw or the you know they had a lot of ... out of out of really good player\nA rounding out a statement serves a lot of it that's all apply for good reason for it when you start thinking about Chris metal I'm\nI'm Eric ... or follow these are all about them and um you know the ability to act guy uh you know ... ... you know that's going back it up or the ... yeah oh first jobs pay\nAttacking and ... according to Eric in the old record getting you know lay off the docks in threes and start you know I think there's been a really good stretch of the basketball games that\nYou know and I think you know the average Joe ... can't we can't we maintain it you know feels like there's times when we get a little bit uh lackadaisical ... may be you know we don't Spanish crippled possessions we need to get you know fifty fifty balls and loose balls and be more and made it on the east or\nMaybe a little more attention or an activity from certain rotation spots and just you know being even better defensively and then I'll than simply kind of his name you know\nMay may slow down a little bit get a little stagnant uh not as much people movement ball movement the execution gets a little bit less than what we want to be but it's all and I think that stuff that is part of the process part of learning and you know it's exciting to think about how much better we can get\nTortured it feels like we played a full four quarters full frontal or in the opening night at the forum ball struck a little bit we seem to get stagnant and the second half in Charlotte is that a good observation\n[noise] yeah you know I think uh the the Indiana game and about like you know much closer to play you know or or core is a really good basketball and there are still you know times there where we could be a lot better uh both collectively and it's basically the ... you know Charlotte game I think the fact that while we're wasn't\nAs much Baltimore that wasn't as much pay so yeah we just got to be mindful of that and try and see if we can do it for ... orders\nCoach on friday night against the Pacers of a buck set about you I'm sure you know this but the bucks on a franchise record for three pointer temps even John Henson hit two three pointers did you expect this much success will be off and so in the early going of the season [noise]\nIt's you know I think when you're new to a theme and near to a group of players you're never sure you know\nHow things are going to evolve on both ends of the court and I would say for you know the most of the first days then think of practice them really grew\nYou know the open jam in September of the guys have been great if I kind of um you're trying to understand what we want to do out there actually how we want to move in\nAnd then share the ball and space and shoot you know raise if we can't get to the basket and um you know so I think that's the only place but I also you know we can get much better off in that way so um but you know jobs are working on just raise those summer and now you're going to see more of a from John\nTorture was great to see the place went nuts when he hit his second three pointer and I bet you got a big smile on your face over that\nYeah no it's fun I think you know John put in a lot of time and work it out for her\nBut you know what you have it done something previously\nYou know your opponents the fans everybody's a little bit you know surprised though to have that little bit extra jolt of energy and his teammates are excited for that for him because they've seen him working on it and they know we can make it\nUm but no doubt you know three from some job and a quarter I'm just gives you that little bit of extra juice you know and it was just fun to see this ban that everybody is so excited but John\nAnd speaking of player development and player growth uh you've really been known throughout your career for your focus on player development coach but obviously every head coach works on player development but what what do you think you do or what system may be put in place the but perhaps achieve apart\nYeah well you know I think because of what your match that there's a lot of people that maybe take notice that you know there's been some successes on the players that get this question fair amount I always say you know the the biggest thing I think we do and it's so simple is wait wait give it time every day\nYou know it's if the priority as we plan our days and we plan our players\nYou know how they're going to go about their day and player development as it is a huge priority and there's some days where you know you can't get to everything and something's got to be sacrificed\nRarely if ever as butter development sacrifice that thing you know maybe other other places other programs\nUm you feel like you may be how to do things and the whole or you know work on it here synergy maps and those things are all important no doubt um but I Would say ... you know we are as giving 'em to learn about a minute or assistant coaches thriller high level\nThey really understand our system they really understand what our players are going to need to do you know when it comes game time and how they're going to need to execute or there'll be Reeves there in a situation and you know it's not just scoring passing and handling and making decisions so\nI just think you know between given at time and have a great assistance\nYou know we feel like a player development can be something that you know hopefully we're doing it a really high level\nTalks speaking of assistance virtual your entire staff from Atlanta is joined do here I'm sure that's a tremendous comfort to you in a real plus in the early going\nYeah no doubt about it I mean you know that side from them or do a really really high high level it out but for all you know it it allows 'em up off of that so I really thought of my\nOwn you know I was talking

what you pay if the checkout is going up and so this time right now is the strongest and probably a decade\nFor the argument that I make that you should buy private label or store brand instead of

I'm from two different companies I work for the past um\nOne is currently sitting about Eighteen thousand some change and the other way around seven thousand um course longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer a four O. one K. so I guess the question is what do I do with this money to ...\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nFor the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small businesses have different issue\nAnd that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out quickly\nAnd move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers\nFor having IRAs or vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments okay than we have them let me tell you how many do not call the\nYeah um let me tell you how many do not call the administrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address he wants to send you a check never take a check because what they do\nIs they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS as withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred\nIn the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then they recommend an IRA or the Ross Iraq I'm not here but I just want to hear you talk about that it's\nAll right so the story as you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a rock without having a big tax bill because all that money they don't want him was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. with that money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on some day now let's talk about the other one the seven thousand\nIs that in a big employers plan or small\nBut it's a very large employer they're trail the stock exchange\nSo is a big employer the odds favor that will be extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollar and you could just leave at seven behind and move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that then then you're able to contribute straight to the Iraq versus trying to go through back\nAbout ... great question so let's say let's keep it simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard\nSo if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them to be on guard\nAnd an IRA and just be done with the old employers four one K. is because it was with vanguard the cost will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo leave the twenty five to grow and the vanguard IRA and then\nYou open a new account with vanguard for Roth in any current or future contribution see may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be the so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accounting a raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the raw\nAnd this will be a way for you to do it you simplify your wife you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA\nNew money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward Chris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want

option so all it is as a matter of what might be the best priority with nothing but good choices so let me start with a question\nThat is key what is your mortgage interest rate\nRight now it's actually pretty low I Believe it's about three point six percent\nFix for the life of alone no priority at all paying extra on that so okay when I look at priorities four one K. do you both have for one case\nI have my own four one K. through my employer and then she's a schoolteacher so they have a different system set up but yes we both have retirements\nOkay and each of you putting in enough contribution to get whatever match there might be on the retirement plan\nThat plus additional yes\nSo you're not doing Roth IRAs I Would guess\nNo no we're not so bad and the other option the price of solar\nCars the Roth is what I Would do next because if you do the raw\nIt has such and they built in tax advantages and then also has the flexibility in the event you had\nA financial catastrophe like the job loss not enough money coming in or whatever so with the raw you can put in with maximum flexibility zero dollars a year\nUp to fifty five hundred each end of the ...\nThe beauty of the Roth is even though you don't get any tax break putting money in the money in it grows tax free and if left alone into retirement\nIs spent tax free so it's a beautiful mix with the four oh one K. you're doing and she's probably doing it for three B that those are both pre tax things the Roth gives you a post tax pile of money and so having in retirement\nA pre tax pile of cash and a post tax pile of cash allows you to do proper planning with where here next dollar should come from\nWhere you manage your tax bill in each year of retirement\nOr again and if you look at my investment guy to Clark dot com I have my favorite cheap choice companies\nTo open up a raw and the beauty is you can\nInvest in them or once you have one open you can add little amounts to a each month or each pay period to big amount whenever it works in your life as long as you don't see the annual maximum of fifty five hundred each so that would be\nThe highest priority I Would see and again congratulations

good thank you Larry you want to ask you about something that ah that I have\nBeen into for a long time for at least oh how many years now at least twelve years and that solar\nRight [noise] what are you thinking of doing Larry\n[laughter] well I I just started looking into it you know thinking about doing solar for a residential house and I'm trying to compare the options of a you know the ... time they say they're your trip here say it's about nine years and whether it's worth it or whether it helps the resale value of your house\nAnd to finance is whether it's easier to cash or to use the suppliers or money or they'll supply to the interest rate [noise] or just an information of that nature\nYeah so whether you're buying so or will automatically pay off for you\nIs an unknown it's hard to say for sure I've done it just because I Believe that it's part of our future and I was willing in spite of how cheap I Am\nWith things that involve energy I'm really willing to put my wallet to work even if I don't get to pay back so I'm a participant in that area\nSo when I install solar\nPanels were much less efficient than they are now and they cost more than they do now\nSo hey the numbers\nAre far more favorable to you putting solar\nThan it was when I put in software last decade\nSo I'm just because the numbers are much more favorable doesn't mean it's going to pay off for you because the questions that come up is ah what kind of good southern exposure do you have you have a road when your house\nTo house faces west and some cable roof is facing directly so and I had one representative come look at eight and he said yeah that's okay so\nYou don't get you want more than one that's not the most important thing I've learned about solar is that\nYou get multiple quotes and most people feel comfortable once they've gotten two or three with so or if there are let's say five active solar installation companies in your area I Want you to get quotes from all five\nBecause you'll learn things just through talking with the sales people\nAnd you don't want to just let them go look at your property and give you a written quote you want to walk the property with um you want to be talking to them you want to learn\nHow they decide where to place how they decide if your property is um an efficient enough one and it ... and at the U.S department of energy website you should be able to find it a information\nAbout how to him a how to figure out your pay back not based on what they tell you but what you were able to see for yourself\nAnd where's that website to\nI'm trying to remember if it's on Energy Star dot Gov or energy dot Gov a producer Joel was checking right now what we're talking on the issue of paying for it if you're in a position to pay cash\nPay cash and just be done with it you're going to get thirty percent of that back as a federal tax credit with your next federal tax return right and as far as whether it increases the value of your home or not when you go to sell it\nIt depends whether in the area you live there's a culture of installing solar if there is then people ascribe value to you having so we're on your house\nAnd the only study done was done ... out west that found that the average installer so we're led to a Seventeen thousand dollar increase in the value of the home but if nobody around do you does so were they may not see the value in it\nSo you would have to make your own case with what your utility bills are\nRight [laughter] well I live in the southeastern system urging air as far as I can tell there's a few houses and in this neighborhood that have it already\nAnd if you talk to any of your neighbors to get any sense of power bills before and after\n[laughter] are you going to the guy was talked to wasn't home and I tried but like you mentioned I'm just starting this process so\nI Will have a war to him yeah All right so the more research you do the more ... comfortable you'll be with the decision you make them and it I mean one of those things not to do impulsively\nYeah [laughter] for sure [laughter] have you got paid back I'm years I Know you said you had an older system is is it to where you're happy with it well like you thought it would\nIt's it's better than I thought it would be\nAnd we're seeing really really nice reduction and power bill but it's going to take me I'm even with the credit it's going to take me and its energy doctor where you find the guide to going solar\nOkay I'm going to take me it looks like fourteen years to get paid back\n\nHave you talked to anybody who's starting this recently and then their pay back time or they're estimated\nThey know you know I don't know how often people actually figure it out\nYou know I don't know there there are people I'm sure that are that are really numbers oriented that really do thorough research lifetimes what people do is they say no ah they live in a part of the country that that is suitable for solar and they install a system they got back to thirty percent\nAnd they're really comfortable with what they save on bills every month but that's more subjective than objective\nAnd that's why you want to look at the energy guide see if you can figure out what kind of payback you'd have where you live in the southeast I can tell you for me what's great\nIs writing a very small check or no check at all for my power bill in a month is fantastic and is it up is with us\nUp welcome to the Clark Howard show hey Hi how you doing I'm doing a lot of ... ... ... well great\nI'm doing a lot of a

civility related to politics in the lead up to the mid term elections on November six\nIs this part of the story\nWe all know there's people out there that aren't stable and they can't make rational

them off\nAnd homes of people they they would like to see gone and I I I may ask this later in the show\nIs this the the new age of violence when it comes to politics we saw it in the Nineteen sixties certainly the fascination with John F. Kennedy his brother Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd you wonder if if if that tension is being echoed today because of this inability to process the differences between people the understanding that we made different politics but doesn't mean we should hate each other\nSo we'll follow that story a story line throughout the day a device founded the home of the Clintons in chapter ... about thirty miles north of New York city and uh as as details emerged we will cover that story for you right here on WGM J\nUh joining us in a few minutes we'll be Wisconsin congressman Glenn growth many debates with his opponents I'll ask them about that will I'll ask him if he's going to meet with the president most any today\nI Know he's only ... only talk with the president a couple of times but ah [noise]\nIt's an interesting race a lot of money being poured in he he uh his opponent has a lot more assets than Glenn Grothman has\nA green growth when does the popular congressman out there in a very conservative district so we'll ask them what is the outlook looks like having a November six as early voting has B. gun that's all coming up on the show today the city with you on this Wednesday regimen WGM Jay [noise]\nWho you're going delays right now I guess way possible\nNews radio WGM Jay\nWisconsin's best company for replacing their homes windows is called citing unlimited\nUnlimited [noise] years ago they expanded from just citing into windows and roofing day as a whole lot more and became Wisconsin's best contractor for all of those things the names citing unlimited was already established trusted\nBut they do great at all of these jobs here in Wisconsin citing unlimited is the best at windows and the vast roofing and of course the best that citing citing unlimited us the best that everything on the outside of your house\nCiting unlimited as the only Palo windows them certified contractor in Milwaukee citing unlimited as an elder being smart side mastering stronger citing unlimited platinum timber tech hand exec desk\nBuilders when you need and want the best for your house contacts citing unlimited started citing unlimited dot com [noise]\n\nGreen Bay football means one thing to Wisconsin It's time for Gina della from Palo oh come on you big Wayne Larrivee will be a little too busy for this during football season I'm never too busy with the price is right you know our him Wayne and get back to the play by play with the Green Bay football season underway leading Gina data from Palo more\nReading my mind the gears Gina thinking Wayne but it's just a messenger and Green Bay football means plenty of called name and you need Paolo windows and doors of Wisconsin to keep people calling me you don't say Gina what on earth just fell I have to do with keeping you warm\nStates acting Wayne State they're not footing the bill for acting school chip prima Donna\nHere last year when it because you need the\nVaccine you might just be true in your home alarm windows and you also get your point nine percent for having your hands bear\nIs your fellow easy money Yes sir\nDowntime slash rainy\nFor credits or something like ... the cat any we prepare your children for college life from K through ... graduation day flat as the eye neighborhood\nSchool ... ... looks like he turned his final Alice Randall how the ... and I\nSaid he's out now than my to train their role models a lot of times and he joins Simon is okay and you know just to get back in the class that teachers have a lot of passion for what they do and match or a\nVery positive and environment so I'm very case will say I'm very confident in taking risks not being afraid to the long but just real\nThis is Shane king had for example the cat and printed out open house French Sunday Passover twenty eight eleven PM submission screening as November ... for some of the cat any data on call to six to seven eight three thirty two hundred\nForty forced to be with you on this Wednesday [noise]\nJoining me on the line is congressman Fleming growth and good morning congressman [noise] morning glad to be on the show\nSo are you going to uh meet the presidents and most any today by any chance\nWell we gotta decide later today I I don't know yet for sure um we have to change some other things out in the ... I may go up there\nAll right so your your opponent and yourself have now had a debate how did that go\nUm well I think it well well I mean for those those paying attention to this race or frustrating thing is I think my point is not addressed a lot of issues he didn't address last night I think welfare reform is an important issue I\nThink a lot platitudes but we have big problems the current immigration system I'm not sure he feels the same way and some of it was kind of interesting I was clear my opponent\nOut against photo ID and while that I Do not necessarily anticipate voting on that a federal level we couldn't the future have a Congress come in and say uh against the law federally dashed\nSay a against the law federally to ask for a photo ID I think that's extreme position and I was kind of surprised\nThat Dan Cole was so adamantly opposed a I felt that during the debate to a a a simple requiring produce photo ID something and he sometimes for for buying drugs or you know renting movies that sort of thing and all of a sudden I thought that it became a little bit extreme\nThey're so on on health care like most of the Democrats they're talking about this single payer health care did that come up in the debates and and I would have guessed that the your opponents are getting cold supportive of that the that efforts\nBy it it kind of opposite leaders on that talks about you know bringing in Medicare and I don't know how we're going to pay for\nUh the Medicare that we currently have you had a lot of people to Medicare he clearly was a big advocate though for Obamacare initially and he was for a a a very big a government health care for ... years ago when he ran for the state assembly in Milwaukee County the last time he ran for public office\nYour district is still conservative district in and one that I think understand the issues probably maybe better than a lot of other districts so when you look at the race he's obviously the nephew of a former senator us a U.S senator Herb Kohl or he's outspending you correct\nYeah yeah I think is outspent you'd probably two to one so far so it's a very scary thing I mean there's a reason why people try to raise money money counts or something like ... to to wander these up on Green Bay TV maybe three ads for every ad I have a puts me in a very precarious position\nDo you do you sense that people understand the fact that he really he hasn't been in this district for very long\nWell yes they are listening you know he spent the last eight years of his life prior to coming home being in Washington and being a lobbyist\nFor some of that time in Washington he also doled out packed dollars to people so I think maybe the shadowy is job in Washington is the person who goes around collects money he had to collect money from very left wing people then turn around and Dole out tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars\nThe candidate he was going out while overnight nine percent of the dollars he collected a turn them over to a democratic candidates are the very partisan a lobbyist up there and ah that's one of the reason why they will raise so much more money than me by the way he got\nThese connections with the hyper well in New York by for wealthy in California\nThe hyper wealthy in Florida through his job with a an organization called J Street but it is a scary situation for me um because you know people believe what they say on the air and like all we have therefore I Would call lies certainly distortions\nAnd I'm I'm afraid that people believe it and hopefully you know as we get a bar at maybe\nHopefully will approach to the point where we had on half as many as as he as in Green Bay I don't know if we can get there but it's a scary situation\nWisconsin congressman Rosemary I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you to hold for one second we're gonna update on the on the current situation with the discovery of bomb at the home of a bill and

pieces a lot of moving parts and obviously the breaking news story is going to lead off our for our town that explosive devices mailed\nSome cases are showing up at the home of George Soros and the home of bill and Hillary Clinton that's number one of our fortune the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the states and the world CNN evacuated at one point while they were on the air\nEric [noise] uh not a lot known about this yes but we know these certain figures were targeted\nThey quickly said that they believed they were linked to say well when we first heard about it it was the Clinton house then we heard about the Obamas\nAnd immediately they said they believed that these devices or whatever they happened to be we've heard pipe bomb we've heard explosive device whenever it may be which they also called rudimentary which means very basic device\nI was linked to the George Soros situation yesterday he is the liberal financier who found that his compound some type of device\nOn my yesterday or maybe Monday I was I'm so now here we are now learning that a pipe bomb or some type of device was also sent to the White House it was an intercepted well before it even made it close to the White House\nAnd he he issued a statement actually saying accused him of playing politics with health and safety of our citizens delayed delayed delayed seems to be the president's monitor here referring to President Assad's you Hamilton the real issue is transparency transparency in truth the citizens and families of Milwaukee deserve so these two have been going back and forth on this Hamilton comes back\nAccused excuses ... who ah who has already announced remarkably so that he's a twenty twenty mayoral candidate of grandstanding here's what Hamilton says I'm not interested in wasting staff and council members time create a spectacle that would approve nothing but an opportunity for you to grandstand on the issue I come down as a ... year\nLet's get to the facts of the case let's find out what's who's responsible for the delays for the bad communication maybe in some cases the retribution that was raining down upon health department employees for not producing information not letting them tell people about what was happening in their departments\nBottom line is people can be affected by these decisions or lack of decision and lack of leadership whether it's a shanty Hamilton urban Baker\nI think ... he's always he's on the something here you have to ask these questions let's get Bevan bakers subpoenaed so we can find out what the real answers are I understand that politics understand Tony's Lewinsky's throwing his head into a race that hasn't even begun yet\nThere's always going to be that when you're talking about elected officials doesn't anyone to take a shot the Hamilton has some career aspirations when it comes to a higher office\nHands mayor of Milwaukee they're not no one's immune from this but the bottom line is the citizens of Milwaukee deserve answers on their health and if you have any health departments and as someone who led that department the words and his conduct matter and that's where I think ultimately\n... getting too we've also reached out the ultimate lifted he wants to talk about this and\nI I don't think we've heard back yet but uh I don't I don't think that a shot to Hamilton president Hamilton is right when he says that someone is leading hundreds leadership\nHe's asking tough questions\nQuestions that should be asked\nLast thing from Hamilton whereas the city trying to respond a probably a probably to this crisis while you and your accomplices offer only criticism and conspiracy theories wrapped in misinformation that confusion so as you're a leader I asked you excuse yourself from the table when when the hard decisions are being made or I by God's will it will excuse you again that's much on the Hamilton\nI'm not sure where he's going with that and again let's let's mute the politics out of it let's get to the bottom\nOf this and figure out what is the problem here who dropped the ball what we can do and how we can fix it classic Milwaukee problem\nPolitics overcoming overriding everything else not fixing the problems that exist get the politics out of its ultimate someone's he's an end\nPresident Hamilton are both welcome to come on

but I think it's important that when you when the health and safety are citizens are on on the on the table I think we have to think about what we're doing number three more positive story brewers

September and October last week we expected those guys to to be a big part of our future and one capacity or another and and I still think they're going to be a big part of our future\nSo I Know Jeff is out he's not watching the world series you're obviously in you'll you'll take part so we'll Stearns indoor council wants to fall classic\nI'll watch it this is ... is it going to be painful sure but but I'll I'll watch it and and uh you get to watch two very good teams go at it for for a chance to be a champion\nA man I've definitely watch it a hundred percent it's look it's it's really high level baseball it's fun to see it\nYou know from my perspective there is things to pick up on and learn and understand situational lay strategically you know what happens in these games we we play all these regular season games are still much smaller sample of of playoff games\nAnd uh to to kind of sift through and learn from so they're they're very valuable in that regard\nSo the uh the last comments probably we will here for a while from David Stern and credit counseling at the last comments but as we wind up twenty CNN look it was a great run fantastic season or\nBy all accounts has access you don't everybody doesn't win the world series ever doesn't get to go to the world series but they came one game away from being able to do that and say that so I I give my uh lots of credit you both Davis turns in credit card so we're in good hands and the brewers organization\nThis isn't just an occasional thing Steve a damned back she wrote this story actually former former a game that journalists himself former Journal Sentinel journalist\nUm did the story and counted over seven hundred instances of a Center for investigative journalism pieces appearing and didn't have papers since two thousand Thirteen\nGive me some idea of what those storylines where whereabouts\nWell you can go on to their website and see how they described themselves and I think right there is proof that it's really advocacy journalism on we've had a whole series of stories about Scott Walker and\nAs they describe themselves an attack that's the word they use on public sector unions\nOkay I Know folks who are in unions would consider it an attack I Know many people would say that what ... did is not good for unions but there's another perspective too\nI mean how about Daschle describing it as what Scott Walker has done for taxpayers through at ten so the way they frame their stories and they probably maybe don't even realize it themselves is a\nIs I think has perspective somewhat safe bias in his advocacy but that's just one example there seven hundred\nOf these uh of these are stories that have appeared well some of those I I Can't say seven hurt me some of these stories have appeared in multiple get out papers but another one that a damn Benson pointed out was one from last uh\nLast August in which\nThey I think it's fair to say lamented the speed at which the Walker administration has pushed through some significant legislation that yeah you know so those were a couple of examples\n... here's how I see it playing out when I when I look at the coverage and I read everything about the the elections I was obviously of the mid term elections coming up I read everything about them and I and I and I look at the stories the choices that editors make\nOr to send reporters outs ah at two do uncovered certain elements and it does seem like just from the casual perspective of somebody who talks about politics for a living there\nSeems to be an increased emphasis on covering the critical elements of the Walker campaign less so on ... campaign let me give it a direct example the plagiarism story last week\nTony Tony Evers responds with no discipline we'd knowledge that have happened and then that was like the end of the story where's the heart journalism being done on that story and why is that not continue to\nBe I mean I I have to say that I I was a little surprised especially with journalists who if you plagiarize in a newsroom at least when I was in a newsroom he got fired because a big deal and it's a big story\nIt's really a big deal when it's when the policy has posted on your own Web site at the department public construction and yet you were found guilty Tony Evers being the you there of doing that very thing yet there's no discipline in there\nYeah and you know I Do I Do think that a lot of reporters they do do make an effort to be fair to to be to be objective um\nAnd and often succeed I'm with the stories that they do right I'm not always but I just think they're in an atmosphere where they often don't see the things of interest to folks who are in the stature even let alone on the right so it's also the things that they don't like the questions that they don't ask\nWe're talking to Mike Nichols president of the bathrooms which over here to take a quick break here we come back other issues facing journalism in in the era of

reading your rights are pointing to the ... ex boyfriend Ryan he'll I guess\nI'm framing it that way that he had something to do with it questionable action suspicious actions and are also people

point\nI understand the role of of groups like the Innocence Project in trying to make sure that the evidence and the the er\nThe facts of the case or ironclad that's really not how the justice system works you make the best case the best argument and then a judge and jury decides there's no absolutes you could they have done things better in prosecuting the case absolutely\nShould they not have done some of the things that don't probably there is no perfect case but I think the avalanche evidence suggests it was Steven every and rented that's involved in this case and I'm Sorry I don't feel

the work that's being done CNN was threatened uh\nAnd uh the work that's being done CNN was threatened a that's suspicious device was sent there as well causing a a\nAlmost a widespread panic as they were getting alarms as they were broadcasting Jim shoot ... some of the other house had to actually the building and we're broadcasting from the streets outside CNN so there's a lot of uh information out there they're going to bring in the latest on that in a few minutes on the on the news coming up\nBut in the next half hour in talk about something more technology related and it has to do with a decision\nAbout our country\nAnd in this case the countries Sweden but we've we've touched on that story here with Wisconsin with the company three square market and they have I think about sixty five employees now that are microchips embedded in their hands between their summer for finger\nIf as was the case with the George Soros explosive device was rather crude and design\nShifting topics and shifting gears slightly here and you can weigh in as well for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I Love this topic I Love talking about technology to begin with\nA well back early on in the ten year old ... my ten year on T. M. J. we're on the team we talked about the three square marketing company in Wisconsin\nWho had asked their employees are the ones to invent a micro shift microchip between their thumb and for finger to ease the process of logging into the computer or buying items in their snack bar opening and closing some of the doors at the facility\nAnd I and I love that story because I think they had about up there a couple of hundred employees it got like fifty to sign up for ... they've ramped it up like sixty five or Seventy five now that have these devices so I saw this story or\nFrom Europe and if you don't know part of the part of the uh thing you get to do and you're on the radio shows you spend a lot of time reading and I read the story about sweet and they're jumping into this thing in a big way\nAt this moment for thousands Swedes have implanted a similar microchip like the one at three square market utilizes that contains information about their identity they can use these things these four thousand people\nTo get cash like an ATM cash tickets that can use it for access to buildings and facilities parking and even social media\nAnd you think about this technology and and the the limits and some of the questions that it raises\nAnd one of the big ones just because somebody hack into your system and your body 'cause it's things inside your own body could they do and there's companies that are looking at that as well\nJune ... twenty Seventeen so go back a year Swedish train operator hundred people were using microchips to pay for the train trips\nYou can read the chip with a smartphone and they can confirm the past years paid for their journey so that that is as easy as it gets\nAnd again it's it's simply injected really into your your hand between your thumb in here for finger\nLot of large Swedish companies knowing implanting employees with microchips as I said keys credit cards train tickets they used as it's called near field communication NFC technology same as the contact with credit cards is we have mobile payments\nAnd it only has to be a few centimeters away the the two things are two devices the microchip and the device communicates\nThe implants are passive\nThere's no other information that they can get off of it but you couldn't easily find out somewhere else\nBut my question is really will just catch on here I think it will clearly in Wisconsin a three square market it has already we haven't seen a rush of companies doing this\nAnd when I when I originally member talking about this with Scott Morris and Eric long time ago I had some hesitation but you know what I'm almost to the point where like if I could make my life easier by not having to carry something in my pocket or in my coat certainly jackets wouldn't it be an easy way to do business\nAnd ultimately that someone's gonna cut me open and cut it out of my hand I think would probably be safer than some of the things we carry around in our wallets for one for seven nine nine what six one of the acting in markets talking text line maybe I'm the only guy that cares about this I think it's a big\nDeal I think doing something like this Sweden thousands of

got to the gas station to fill up half a tank and to grab it\nYou are not supposed to be allowed to work and again I draw the distinction between in the country illegally versus somebody who is a legal immigrant if you are a legal immigrant you can in fact get a driver's license for one for seven nine nine one six twenty Nick in Milwaukee Nick good afternoon\nI Know I think it's a horrible idea 'cause like you just said there are already here illegally by offering urged you're going to reward on ... a driver's license or what you're going to go out\nOn it [noise] well I think it's a terrible idea\nI'm not too well I mean I I guess I mean that's one of the concerns of people have is it just means that\nOkay it's going to be easier to vote because you have the data vacation I don't know about that or or otherwise but\nI did just want it maybe it's it's just the simplistic thing but this is one where you go back to see what part of illegal do we not understand if somebody is in this country illegally All right\nAnd they are for example involved in some massive automobile accidents right do you do think they're going to have the wherewithal to make people whole do you think that they're going to be able to get insurance the answer is probably pretty much know so what\nWhat why are we encouraging somebody who's broken the law to get here in the first place to be able to stay and then again it to me it all begs the question if you're in this country illegally you you're not supposed to be allowed to work\nSo this idea will they needed to drive back and forth to work\nWell okay the employers aren't supposed to be issuing you're not supposed to be employing people anyways if they're not in this country legally I mean we're\nJust stationed there there next week or so they're they're going to a sales scripts his own just a good karma so you know all of the employees at Scripps nor are now going to become good karma employees don't last week I had to fill out

the roadway legally a coup o'clock in the morning my son had your car your\n... your I mean I played out I think on my car thirty one hundred dollar doesn't hundred dollars for damages people ... are we knew who it was\nBut we both filed\nA brief apartment I'm a complaint for liquid around them [noise] um [noise] what could have it of course a week later get a call from the police department\nOr the guy with a new legal itll you're in ... and I'm In I'm ready for me to have you went back to Mexico\nRight we're going just gone right right no no bond no insurance you're out of luck bottom line right\nYup nothing to see that and that's I guess I mean that that is the the reality now I get to an extent what are you saying because he's saying look at people who are in this country illegally they're driving anyways so they're going to do it anyway so why don't we just make it legal for them to do that\nNow my friends and colleagues keeps these ... and he had a great analogy when I was telling the stories of okay well that's the case if we assume that people are just going to shoplift why don't we just I don't know have merchants all the stuff out put it on the curb to make it easier for people to do that\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty um let's talk to let's see Jamie in Milwaukee Jimmy or until the MBA\n[noise] yes well first of all these people are not illegal their own document and nobody illegal there in the country illegally while yeah for for the dot com illegal aliens\nYou you can use your term I use mine there in the country illegally we agree on that right at\nThe bill that out for a number of years where um it it it it and it's a nonpartisan if both parties are there's like a young guy that's how many people who agree that um yes we should allow its for public safety issue\nWhy do you say it's a public tell me what tell me what you mean when you say it's a public safety issue\nBecause it was they will get license to what's going on a lot of the road and offer offer mandated to get insurance\nWho's one insurance company is going to issue a policy to somebody that's in this country illegally\nWhy I think you need to talk to elected officials that are great because it is a great it's out there they will insure people it's a money and also are are um\nState coffers won't get money so when people are going to get a license and they have special feet so it's a win win for everybody well\nNo the only way it would be a win or do they ask you this do let me ask you this if somebody registers for this license and they're in this country illegally do you think that information should be available to say immigration for enforcement purposes\nWow that that's a different issue of safety I mean you mix a federal law with ... you know first of all states for federal law right as far as I ration right well that's not that\nWell no but I mean the states could make that information available where would you would you then support giving people driver's licenses with the idea that this was going to be a public record and that I don't know federal immigration officials could check it out and find out who is driving who is in this country illegally that has one of these permits\nOne important thing is these documents if people or a biometric they'll have I Will have those biometric subject commit a crime they can find them a director dirt dirt documents that as far as public safety there here\nIf I can say that I ... I understand okay to him I could do you keep saying public safety I don't\nBut [laughter] okay so I don't know what why you think it is safer so somebody goes in and they passed a vision test and they get a license why that suddenly makes them safer on on the roadways bottom line is they're not supposed to be here in the first place\nThey are committing a crime by coming into this country illegally and staying and for this idea that again we're\nWe're we're going to well that they needed to drive back and forth to work well I go back to my larger point they're not supposed to be working either I mean the we have laws that say to these different employers you you're not supposed to be hiring people who are in this country illegally so if the idea is\nThat we're going to give drivers licenses to people in this category so they can do the work to work at jobs they should be legally doing in the first place\nWhere is that where is the sense to that for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to carry and Madison carrier WTO O. J.\nHigh I got in the last caller I'm a ...\nI got in the last you know if they are making but fortunately that's why you know legal driver carry insurance on a plane or\nYou know the last like that getting some on drivers like right right public or insure that that's right I think it's a horrible idea a warning or illegal activity are here illegally\nShould not be working and you're not able to track just because you are getting them I guess\nRight ... ... ... ... exactly on all those different levels now than they used to call I mean look\nI I I understand there is the simplistic appeal low welders there here anyways they're going to do it anyway so why don't we authorized this well this\nAll right that you you can make that argument about just about anything hey why don't we have heroin legal because people use heroin so I mean they're going to do it any ways why should we care people are going to shoplift let's just put all this stuff out there I Am sorry\nThere are all sorts of provisions to allow people who are legally in this country to get driver's license I support those provisions one hundred and ten percent but as far as treating people who are in this country illegally with giving them licenses I think Scott Walker is right I think Tony ... is Ron twelve twenty seven ...\nAren't our insurance provides knowledge and the guy the businesses and families throughout Wisconsin\nAs one of the largest independent insurance agencies in the mid west Marin darn provides on natural resources we measure results to make sure you're protecting anything should ever happen to your family or that business you've worked so hard to build\nOur and our insurance we aren't the knowledge rovers\nPleases if my knowledge broker dot com to learn more\nFrom our urban centers bursting with festivals door beautiful outdoor Vesta Wisconsin has something for everyone discover all the amazing adventures winning W hat on trial in Wisconsin with John Ritter your\nWisconsin's radio station\nIs exploding GM Jay he's witty where every Sunday [noise]\nYesterday I got to what happened on the field for do you believe it was to have gotten this done it's nice if they did they feel better about it as well\nAs you said the hikers Wayne Larrivee on Wisconsin's after the news with genres your Tuesdays at three twenty\nBut you you do have these competing interests you have people who are in many cases looking for a better life so they are fleeing en masse thousands and thousands of people begin reports are second Caribbean ... is being organized\nShould we what should we do I\nMean it ... this is a country of course then it one way to the country built on immigrants you know come give us your your your your tired your poor yearning to be free\nAll right should we do that and if you have five six seven ten thousand people whatever the numbers are who present themselves at the southern border saying you know we're looking for a better life\nShould we just let them into this country is that the humanitarian thing to do is it the right thing to do or are we heartless if we turn them away for one for seven nine nine what six twenty that is the acting it mortgage talk and text line right now\nPresident Trump is saying hey I my plan is to deploy the military I Want to stop people from getting into this country they're trying to use diplomatic measures with Mexico to get Mexico to stop people from coming into getting through Mexico stop 'em before they get to our border where you didn't have this issue created\nThere's also threats to go after some of the Central American governments who are\nI mean again some of the arguments are the those governments are encouraging people to leave but you know this is a mess\nAnd it's going to hit home assuming the caravan stays together it's going to hit home in the next week or two for one for seven nine nine one six twenty should we just let people in understanding that\nBy coming in they are probably going to just assimilate themselves into the United states\nFor one for seven nine nine which six twenty we discuss in a moment if you're on the line please hold on top forty one ...

visited originally decided they were going to ban clowns costumes from their Halloween celebrations and we had a guy who called and said he was driving around with a clown mask in the front seat of his car\nAnd I I asked in that that obvious question of of why and neither is Halloween he's I assume it's the same guy said or else there's two of them like that sent me a picture of this giants like clown math [laughter] dropping out of the car [noise]\nOkay well I guess it it it's Halloween just just get with it that's a it's kind of like it's this and this particular case it's kind of like uh what sort of like a clown dummy or some I don't know exactly what it is but it's Halloween get with the program All right\nAs we've talked about on multiple occasions before Milwaukee County is for all intents and purposes it's broke when when you look at\nThe obligations it has\nThat is the money that's going to have to pay out and the money it has coming in it's it's it's broke and you look at some of the big spending projects that that are out there the the court house\nOr the safety building actually um it's it's it's decrepit it needs to be replaced that's probably two hundred and fifty million dollars right\nThen you've got all the issues with the maintenance of the parks you've got the Milwaukee public museum which is in part county you know that they're they're looking to move they they need what a hundred million dollars or whatever\nYou've got the controversy involving the domes you've got the ongoing pension problems I mean it just one thing after another and the truth the matter is\nYou know they're they're just not enough money that that's just the reality so into this mix we throw an item that is in the the new budget and that is\nBus rapid transit\nNow we have talked about this before in my opinion it's part of the ongoing war the ... and Tom Barrett have about cars and the idea of bus rapid transit is essentially to create a dedicated traffic lane\nThat will run from downtown out to the Medical College um for example I mean here it's been nine mile route\nExtending west from the lake front wrong Wisconsin Avenue through downtown through the market university campus out to North holy road where it would then turned south and go down blue mound road\nThen you'd go down blue mountain road till it got to Ninety fifth street and then it would turn west on Wisconsin Avenue if you wanted to go from the beginning like the lakefront out to the Medical College of the total route would be thirty seven minutes on weekdays okay that's that\nIs the idea now the downside of this is that you're going to essentially be destroying the traffic flow because you're going to be taking away a lane at least the lane of traffic\nAll along that route if people live on Wisconsin Avenue are blooming road or you have businesses they're\nWell look out because it's going to be impossible to get out of your driveways and it's going to be impossible to get in and out of of businesses so that's the thing and it's thirty seven minutes I mean I don't know how much time that really shaves off if you got on a bus now and and took that route but it's thirty seven minutes\nThey've got some cocker Mimi projection that claims that if you did this you'd have more than Ninety five hundred writers that would use the service each weekday by twenty thirty five well I I don't know but that's Fifteen or sixteen or Seventeen years\nI don't think so the only way people will be using it in those type of numbers is if it just got to the point where people just said we can't drive cars in the city of Milwaukee are Milwaukee County anymore so we've got no choice but to use it which might be the master plan of people like Tom Barrett\nAnd Chris safely but in any event here here's the deal\nI'm the estimates are to get it started\nWith the bus stations the bus rapid transit lanes the diesel hybrid buses the charging stations if they used electric buses the whole deal to do this will cost fifty two point two million dollars\nFifty two point two million\nMilwaukee County is asking the fed\nTo give us to give them like adult in the market county more so to give them those of you who live in Milwaukee County you are asking the feds to give you thirty seven point four million dollars in grants thirty seven point four million\nAnd again I mean there there are things like you know you talk about these new things you could do if you want it to you know give the buses for example the ability to play with some of the lights to extend the lights in the goes where you could do stuff like that\nAnd it it wouldn't cost you fifty two million dollars you know thanks junior obviously know about what you're talking about gee here's what I did this is what I Believe and again I\nDon't want to go too far down this conspiracy route\nBut this is I think part of this big plan\nTo again it all comes back to the trial which I think that the ultimate plan the new people was okay once we get is dedicated bustling All right then then All right well then we don't want to take these buses then what we'll do is will this is the justification give us another couple of hundred million dollars and we'll extend the trolley line there will be out there I mean it's just\nThat the bottom line is is fifty two million dollars in seriously if you look at all the major problems that we have in this community\nFifty two million dollars for rapid bus transit line that knocks a couple of minutes off this particular route and he's going to really really really today is a really really screw up traffic along that route because this has\nBeen when the freeways for example have a problem Wisconsin Avenue blue mount road these are some of the principal alternative things I just taking away a lane of traffic\nAt the cost of fifty two million dollars is just to me what's the word I'm looking for nuts nuts let's talk to Mike and wins lick my current campaign\nAfternoon or Jeff from Milan first with us or Orange County and this is just kind of sickening nobody's reign of buses as it is for the most part they have enough buses going on what are they doing about the court house it's crumbling right it's very old\n... rebuilding the safety building is two hundred and fifty million dollars and it's got to be done there's no question about it\nAbsolutely has to be done also the more the county mental health facility that thing is sixty years older so poorly run what are they doing with that these crimes that they're not doing anything about it I mean these are the facilities people are using every single day\nThe courthouse want the county mental health facility or what\nOne of the nice things they do is the truth or that's what they do the but this ... situation is ridiculous for some people aren't you\nWrite and aren't going to use and then of course you get these Cochran made me number saying well you know within Twenty years we'll have you know nine thousand people using it well okay maybe maybe not a I guess a lot depends on stuff but\nBut right now given all the needs that you've a genocide Milwaukee County gets we're not even talking about some of the ones we're not talking about you know what would they want to do with the dome you know if that's worth preserving or or like a museum or all the park maintenance and stuff like that we're not talking about that\nBut you're going to spend fifty two million dollars on a rapid transit lined give me a break\nAnd the bottom line is I haven't been the millennial generation my generation doesn't want to ride the bus or a medium level city where we can afford it hurt and afford the parking and we want to have her own car and drive a nation and not take the bus\nYou know and they used to call my ... you are you are so right to the reality is that there are ...\nReality is that ... ... there are there are some cities that you go into where ... we were in Europe a couple of weeks ago where or if they're so congested\nUm is it that you just for all practical purposes you can't trucks that that's just the reality\nSo that's why you need a vigorous and vibrant public transportation system and there's places like that in the United states as well Milwaukee isn't that place and I I don't think anybody's arguing with Milwaukee's gonna be that place in the next Twenty years I it cars are cheap parking is cheap it is affordable and that is one of the things when you talk to people who really\nYou know our objective about this for people who don't have cars\nI mean once they get jobs one of the first things they buy is what it is a car because they want the freedom and flexibility to be able to get around when they want and I'm not anti bus\nAnd I'm not saying do away with a do away with the bus lines that we have running out there now also if you've got enough justification add a couple of more bus lines if there's that much but this idea of spending fifty million dollars tearing up the streets\nTaking away lanes from traffic creating all the problems for people who live or work or who do business in that area all to save a couple of minutes it's just not worth it\nAnd it is an ineffective and almost obscene waste of money given all the other needs that we have around here Jim in Franklin Jimmy a WTO O. J.\nHey Jeff not only is there is there a lack of a positive benefit to this there's actually a negative effect on if they put this and on traffic so it'll it'll go things up even more\nAnd uh one other thought is that I'm trying to sow Sharon Hi going to have done for six months and most of the people that I talked to don't want to live in Milwaukee County they all want to move to walk ... county right because of this kind of goofy and that's going on and I was in Milwaukee County it's amazing\nOh well yeah I mean ... ... exactly I mean especially when you look at all the all the very real needs you know that that they have in Milwaukee County for for money you know in these things that you've got to spend the money on you got to replace the safety buildings falling down\nYou've got all these things and we're going to spend fifty two million dollars on a bus line really\nLike you said it's the talk of maybe\nNow Mexico it's just and it it's sort of like one of these\nFrustrating sorts of things and again it's it's all based on this this idea that well okay we're we're going to be able if you build that people will jump on this and this is what people really was\nUm I don't think so I I don't think so now again the best news is this doesn't get off the ground unless the federal government decides that it is going to take thirty seven million dollars and just\nPee into Lake Michigan I mean that's that's effectively what we would be doing so this doesn't get off the ground unless the feds come up with thirty seven million just like Tom's trolley folly wouldn't have gotten off the ground if it weren't for the tens of millions of dollars of federal money that was around hopefully at least for the foreseeable future\nMilwaukee County doesn't get this grant so we don't have to worry about this but you know who knows how that'll turn out to forty five ...

Bay block to shop forty five in Milwaukee forty four degrees get breaking news trafficking weather right now with the WGM Jay mobile app I'm Tony ... news radio WGM Jay [noise]\nSome big decisions to be made and I think a lot of decisions are are are going to be tough to make here for the brewers as they try and re assemble a team worthy of the world series or at least the playoffs or something else scrap Tom in West Alice a double duty um say Hi Tom\nHi Greg I'm my theory um that that could be happening and I want to know what you feel about it is to use him packing up John gulp and Eric than any they're getting themselves the pitcher Oregon themselves and other infielder um one other thing that I Would I Would like to see 'cause I think you're pitching staff with\nBurns down a bunch of other words are are going to be out in the starting rotation depends\nOn what Jimmy Nelson does the uh how he's going to come back from his injury but I can see them constantly doing that or\nI can I can also see them a also making making at the top ... ... a pitcher but Ali and either either and then killed her or or picture might might might help them out I\nWhat would you do with the doctors some\nI I Would actually find most doctors I really like him I Would I Would like to talk as I Hope that they keep the unemployed John second\nWhat'd you bring it back at Fifteen million or whether you looked at it and maybe do a two year deal that reduces the annual value\nI Would actually have a two year jail because I think he wants to win a championship and I think he really likes Milwaukee\nAnd I think that you know you got the talent already here I think it's just a matter of ah doing all that stuff one other thing that I Know they say Greg if it's too bad game seven and a little bit different as far as uh\nWho they brought in after after the second inning I probably would have done a little bit different but that's just my opinion [laughter]\nYeah do I get your comment and that's you know if that was going to be the most ... sort of game seven win or lose it would be the use of Josh hater and are brought in what he was brought any work three innings uh he was not going to ... it also at extending jobs data to afford the ending means you would have had the bat ah in that situation\nUm I I bought bring against Xavier city and it was a little questionable I'm maybe German shepherds doesn't even the Yelp who we get in that ending if he starts the ending of cleaning for Jeremy ... we'll see I think kind of what he where I think in game three that's actually came to that's where I felt like the series\nIt took a dramatic turn brewers had the lead they call it up and it was unfortunate um\nMove stock is it's an interesting case because you do you detect a lot of the boxer's experienced been there done that left handed hitter is a good glove at third base can play first but that's about it that's about all you're going to get out of his doctors are from a defensive versatility uh aspect\nBut I kind of in just a down here are physically handle the power numbers were okayed came up with a big hits\nGreat clubhouse guy sex a lot of boxes but\nThose guys sex a lot of boxes but\nFifteen million bucks that's happy for a guy who hit a little over two forty and uh I don't ride broadly hit about two forty as well a little better than that but he and he's at Nineteen billion but you get the point\nRon it's under contract he's coming back I don't think he's going to be traded to the Dodgers here a stock if you have to make a decision so it was two years ten million\nOr or two years twenty million worth it instead of one of your Fifteen ... that'll do I think that's part of what you have to make a decision on Fifteen million bucks for the numbers he put up that seems to me\nBut can you do a two year deal that less than the average annual value I think that's possible\nI'm also in the position of of the I Would be surprised the very famous and Jonathan scope we're back with his team next year\nBecause I think you've got this little versatility recover first base Aguilar comes back in a more reasonable often a lefty in shock could play first you've got a righty abroad who could play first was ... first if they just kind of worked himself part of the rotation had if he's not an everyday guy\nI really struggled in that pinch hitting role and I just can't see them getting regular at bats with the other names Memphis that's assuming was doc is does come back what is the I'm David Stern sick about the situation\nWhat we'll hear from the

Marty in ... before we do it ...\n[noise] Hey Greg I'm I'm not sure that I Would bring the stock it I guess you know maybe she could work out some kind of like you were saying\nTo me in shock team why her face layer on the line a more reasonable um [noise] so I don't know that it would [noise] you know but I think\nThat being said I think everything starts with what the brewers do at least on the field what they do ... ...\n... ... and now you got shot a place second base or space which banned in scope expendable\n'em sock it doesn't come back and sharp pretty much have to go back to third base and you've got some decisions to make you know as far as the other the other two guys they mentioned and then I guess the other variable and all this\nIs ... ... army ready and even if he is that they bring him out right away or they try and get off\nAnd also they get some another year salary ... and so\nUm yeah yeah and it was\nYeah I think you're right Marty if you're looking at in a house candidates so it does look in house here for a second what would you rather have moose at third and saw it second or would you rather have saw it third and Jonathan scope at second or ... seconds ... you know second baseman a second base becomes a bit of a question\nHere if you decide to depart ways with microbes darkest moved Travis shot back to third base I'm ... and I don't have a great answer for that in a house but I Would rather give doctors the money to stay in play third\nThan I Would rather give is then I Would give scope the arbitration money that he is going to be due to stay in place second so to me scope is on the outside of his looking in the trade of prey to find out if he hangs on I I just I don't see it I I don't see it working in Milwaukee what's on the scope I just don't\nUh enough of a sample size to make it really question what his role would be\nIf they kept it here a peace if another wild card I I Would not imagine that he would be imprint as the starting second baseman from day one um\nMauricio to bond is another name he was a guy that I think was going to be brought up to this team last year when they were really struggling in the middle in field and uh it for a variety of reasons and then he got injured and he's going to be back involved at some point or next season\nA hero I you know he doesn't start with the team I don't think I probably see him at some point next season I just don't know whether that's a crystal ball to the question but\nLooking at in the house candidates\nMoves that third shot second looks pretty good\nGiven the other options that you have otherwise all goes back to a third they got to figure out what to do at second base cuts in hero I'd be shocked if he were not the future at second base for the brewers but I don't I don't know how soon that's going to be next year early on especially I I don't think that's in the cards yes\nUm we still see you'll see him at spring training no doubt Mike is in Brookfield joining us next Mike you're on WGM day\nGood evidence or if you're ... you're chick Jonathan Little cry you only had a one year contract or play\n\nUm I maybe I I don't know that I don't know that lucrative left on great terms\nDavid Stern is that I don't know if that was\nA peaceful and amicable sort of deal or never done it to look right turn down that three that were to send them to Cleveland it didn't just didn't work out so we ended up going to pay taxes and ultimately ended up in Oakland um\nBut was part of a free productive Oakland A's him and they look or I was going to start again pretty much every day character that there is an interesting one I I think a lot of fans would like to see look back in Milwaukee um\n[noise] I I don't know I was not on the inside of those discussions I don't know if there is any frustration between the two parties David ... with a whole parade went down\nBut certainly kept there was a question and there are limited great options available I'm In the in house you've got Matty ... who sort of became a back up the aircraft I I don't think that kept her situation is going to look the same as it did this year next year and it was kind of a turnstile vet baddie didn't work out of Nottingham got a little time but\nFor to Eric Eric had a a season um that was a challenging issue that he started off really well\nUm he had an injury and and uh the guy behind them played really well and and in many ways to get a job um but he's a really talented player and he's proven to eat a talented player a industry now for about a year and a half and found that exciting for us\nUm you're going to come just Frasier any with a chance the endgame meaningful playing time and um we know that uh we know that when he's on the line if you've revise or a pretty impressive\nPowerful force to once you have a system that's enclosed and\nWhen he performed a Thomas French there where do you see Johnson skulls and that that's a\nDiscussion that we're gonna have to continue to have here over the next couple of weeks to a multi um obviously Jonathan has has proven that he is a quality major league player he's had a really impressive stretches throughout his career\nAnd and unfortunately for both him and us read it we didn't see one of those stretches while he was a ... speech to sit down determine if we can determine why and and then we'll go forward\nHow sad that can allow you crack try different and also what does that do for\nMore than you are an option [noise]\nI think look the versatility of players um you know allows me to consider different things that a lot of David ... considered different things more things that just gives us more options in more\nWays we can um you know attack a pitcher or attack roster or something like that so\nUm you know that's you know versatility is that's why we you know we're we're always seeking versus so it's always the deaths of death and verse to kind of go hand in hand some time\nAnd so um you know we did this that's another successful part of this season is that we found a player that's that's got to be with us next year that\nUm you know player that's that's got to be with us next year that that now is multi position on um [noise] you know we we feel comfortable with him is three positions and that's that's a really good thing moving forward and something that uh [noise]\nI'm sure at some point next year we'll we'll we'll use to our vantage\nSir I was gonna say as a former player that you have options to decide on to them into your show the same danger other various tee shirt and the\nI Believe it's all now with the wishes three days of the condition of the world series\nI suppose you share with us any hints on how where you're leaving especially at my socks you you you as opposed correctly\n[laughter] how can you say with good value\nIs if it were the rental for moods and zoom sort of what he gave you over the period\nI think most provided our team with what we're looking for when we acquired and um it was a powerful left handed that I'm really quality survey see and we had a guy who had been there before I'm a driven into our clubhouse culture is a\nUm it was a pleasure to have around I think it was on a lot of fun for all of us to get to know and those of us who didn't know him previously um ... there's a reason why he has a reputation um he has a big game firing 'em where we're having a half [noise]\nYeah you kind of have to read between the lines with David Stern these uh you know gives kind of a company lied for a lot of those guys that are ...\n... what stood out to me is that if\nYou obviously recognized it was very open and honest about Jonathan scope not producing in Milwaukee a there was some question whether or not have to go with going to be part of the brewers playoff roster I was for him not being a part of the playoff roster and they really didn't do anything to do to prove that he belonged to the brewers playoff are out there so a\nBig decision to be made and microbes doc is it's one of our callers what it might end up being\nThe first a dominant on the stand tall and has brought back to Milwaukee others will fall if dominoes\nFall and the way of life was dark is going elsewhere then you know what do you do with your ... or do you seek an office from outside of the organization it's going to be an interesting all the firm here for the brewers I'm not thinking it's going to be a wholesale changes but we know David there's not just going to sit down and rest\nThinking that it could bring
