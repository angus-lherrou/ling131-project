Thompson I'd like to think that Brian ... boys and get different trail and I think it's time you will but I'm Wondering if there was a move to be made or anything that makes sense coming up\nBefore the trade deadline for the ... well especially in a league wide it's always pretty quiet last year was sort of an exception because there were a couple of big names that got moved ... for one um and uh Jay ... who went from Miami to Philadelphia and I was a big pick up to the titles of the second half of the season but by large you just don't see\nThat the kind of movement that that you see obviously in major league baseball or in the NBA there's a variety of reasons for that\nThe second thing is you know well I don't doubt that Brian good it comes to it you know at least trying to do things\nThat Ted toms and maybe didn't do or shied away from you know for example of me being in the ... sweepstakes is probably something ... dumps him absolutely would not have to touch 'em over the last several years of of his tenure in Green Bay um\nBut as we were talking in last hour all the issues for this team and some of its defense some of it's often a lot of the execution\nAnd I was even thinking about this when when it was all the speculation with Errol Thomas and with the Packers you know be a landing spot for Thomas before he got hurt I think you're more than one player away I to me that's that's the biggest thing is\nOkay I mean who do you can do you get a wide receiver\nA you know I don't I don't know that that just one guy makes a difference to you try and get yourself a a another outside linebacker\nUm unless it's ... you know the man himself I I just don't know that there's anybody that would be available that would be an instant upgrade to uh to what the Packers happened you know they've gotten home a few times I mean I'll be at\nA you know ... was a rookie and and the sax against Stafford were really I I think kind of coverage shacks or you know staff are just trying to scramble out and falling down they weren't really\nUm I I Would say a induced by you know a pass rush but\nThere's just too many problems I think you've got some secondary issues you've got some linebacker issues ending defensive line it's been great I'm often said why are we talking about is bits of issues there I mean it's just been issues everywhere so you're not re hauling there's this roster and again it goes back to\nWell you know what can you do here you know can you change the the skin addicts or the often skinny make poaching changes can you make roster changes and the reality is that this is for most games once you get the week one\nThat's it you know I mean you may be able to pick up a guy\nI'm all for somebody else's practice squad winds up being a diamond interrupt you may be able to get a street free agent but by and large the fifty three that you have the philosophy that you have and the coaches that you have your right and that they got your writer dial the wait till the end of the season just feel like the best opportunity to acquire the kind of impact player you could be searching for\nThat's gone right and he's on now we have like that that was the silver platter\nOnce in a in a generation kind of offering here that it was totally ruined the raiders deep and hands it already\nPretty good yeah and that's the thing is you know I think it was among the changes that we've seen over these and the NFL over the last few years is\nThat ... or the or the roster or cut deadline deals and trades or to me it's become a lot more fun and a lot more enticing to watch then then the trade deadline\nOr deals because again there's just so few of them but you know you just said see now with teams somebody rebuilding teams that want to go beyond that are willing to jettisoned or you know like the like the raiders willing to do jettison a guy like to live back you'd think how it was clear lack\nA guy who's on the trading bloc\nBut areas there he was and you know pay they put up an offer\nI've ever tried you know [laughter] I think you know if if the guy who uh well it doesn't it's not worth rehashing anymore is it I mean the real loser and the whole ... deal with Aaron Rodgers 'cause he has to worry about where that guy I was wasting water\nRoute and you know if I'll mainly what writers have blamed yeah here's the thing about the bears I Know we'll talk about this a lot is at the season continues to unfold I'm not totally convinced just yet I mean I guess you've you've got to totally respect what they're doing a lot of defense\nOr despite what we saw from Mr basically against Tampa Bay uh I'm not convinced that he's a big time quarterback yet but look at the bears schedule and the second half of the season where they have to play five divisional games\nPlus they also play the rams as well that's a lot of big time football we talk about well look at all the tough matchups the Packers out but they at least know by and large how to handle themselves to those big games the bears don't which ... doesn't know how to how to you know just play that high pressure football week in a week out so let's wait and see how that plays a\nStar and here we go coming up next we will go back into the locker room here from Aaron Rodgers also the injury report somewhat likely will go through it after this on the other whites Packers play

because neither and weeks six and you're still talking about it absolutely right I mean it's not we two of the pre season so I I look at this team and I I feel like there's enough talent for it to be

for a full four quarters of the deacons you've got it against buffalo we've not seen a full four quarters from the off it's probably the forty niners for all the issues they have the opposite side of

M. J. [noise]\nHad a good evening love committed drillers weekly here on WGM Jay my name is Matt\n... for the next hour we're talking all things brewers baseball on the eve of the national league championship series getting underway at Miller Park\nPianist six months ago did you ever think that those words could be coming out\nOf anybody's mouth including mind\nThat the and I'll see us would be opening up at Miller Park maybe you believed in the brewers is B team getting the you know the U.S but my goodness\nIt held to be true and so when the going gets tough\nFor all of those other teams for the cardinals who are in the playoff hunt at that point for the cops who are trying to hold onto the central the team that that have the best chemistry and the best makeup was the team that hit the accelerator and started going faster\nAnd I don't think that's by accident I don't think that's just one of those things where hey the brewers get hot at the right time I think because of who they are is why they got hot at the right time and I think that's a good omen moving forward to are the stakes get bigger it seems like this team plays better\nBrewers radio broadcaster lingering does continuing to join us\nThis there there's a there's this feeling I think for many brewers fans that the nation has not pay attention to the steam and where it's a small medium market I I did that I never too worried about that I I don't care if there's a million people watching or if there's forty thousand people watching\nA wind towns the same to me but now that the ... the national media there year there in Milwaukee it all changes once you get to the ... is that how do you view that ... is is a good is that all of a sudden the nation is going to kind of learn a little bit more about who this brewers team is\nI think it is um I I think this team has enjoyed the fact\nThat they weren't in the spotlight that they could kind of go off over here and just do their thing right show up put their work in ... game\nGo to bed wake up the next thing to do the same thing I I think they enjoyed that part of it\nGo ahead keep paying attention to everybody else will just be over you're worried about us I've heard guys talk about that fact over the course of the year but now that it here I mean this is what you were fighting for your fighting get onto the stage you were fighting to get yourself into this position and here's the thing about the brewers\nThey have guys that have gone through this before you know there's a lot of narrative bone in the playoffs since two thousand eleven\nBut they have just not altogether runs a cane and Mike Lee stock is we're kind of this team but the Kansas City royals and nobody was paying attention to and then they ran through the playoffs in fourteen on the way to the world series losing seven the giants\nCome back on a mission Fifteen when they finished the job um they've been in a very similar situation of the in the past that just postseason experience the same kind of situation with kind of a similar team in a lot of ways that they were a part of Kansas City\nUm guys like I'm Curtis Granderson I mean he he played in New York in the world series for for New York teams I mean he knows what he's doing and I think probably when everything is over when this season is\nSaid and done and we're looking back on the things that help this team get to where they are\nOne guy that's going to deserves some credit as crazy as it sounds came in in September\nHe was used off the bench primarily but I think that the trade for Curtis Granderson is going to be one of those things that go hey that was a big deal that ended up being a really nice addition is getting on base he did a lot of good things on the field\nBut you talk to people around the team and they'll tell you he's got a huge impact in the clubhouse as the guy that is that is so respected and when he talks people listening and it's not just standing up in front of the whole team in addressing them but in individual conversations helping guys along there so much of that on this team\nI'm mad ours who has had a tough year on the mound but you talk to young pitchers carbon burns and they'll tell you look at Albert has had an impact on me and he has helped me get through different things and\nI think that's what this team has so well so um there is experience there are guys that have been on the stage before I don't think that the lights are going to make them blink and relief\nAnd I think those veterans guys that I mentioned are going to help the core of an burns and the Josh Peters of the world move past that and still perform\nLast thing for you something I appreciate about just turned the philosophy of this team is they have their beliefs and they're sticking with them we saw\nA against the Rockies bullpen game in game number one they were avoiding starting left these so they pushed shot scene in the second game in in a lot of people say what are they doing it works out\nNow it's the exact opposite scenario when uh they're taking on a Dodgers team that's really good against riding Anders so they're going to go geo in in ... in games wanting to\nHow much do you do you appreciate the fact that\nThis team thinks outside the box\nAnd they got to this point a certain way oh so you know yes they're not going to fall into a more traditional role whether you know they leave themselves open criticism from some of the traditional baseball folks but they're going to keep doing it the way they've been doing it to get to the point that they've been at\nWell I think the thing that we've learned in the last five to ten years with playoff baseball specifically or\nThe the rich ... of a hundred and sixty two games schedule where you say okay look it's a large sample size and we don't overreact to one performance here or there or one specific matchup here there because over a hundred and sixty to kind of works itself out right and so you can apply saber metrics maybe a little bit easier to one sixty two\nThen you can in a smaller sample size like the playoffs and so the game play so different when\nYou get to the postseason you're going to the bullpen and the third inning you're I mean you're doing all sorts of things you wouldn't normally do and I have long felt like ... council have a step ahead\nOr in in a lot of respect in terms of being very fluid and saying okay we're not going to be confined to a box here we're going to try to find the most creative and most efficient most effective ways\nTo get the outs we need to get so we can win this game\nAnd I like that about him a and I also think that's also a byproduct of not having that through a ... or Clinton Kirk others not quest and you're going to win\nOf all of that guy the brewers don't have that they have strength and numbers they have strengthened that they have sprinkler great bullpen and so it was how can we get to the sixth or seventh inning with a read and what gives us the best chance to do that and it is it's kind of a clip from Iraq where they had had so much success\nAgainst left with their line up the Dodgers have not had much success\nAgainst left these and they've hit right he's pretty well one of the best hitting teams in baseball I guess right handed pictures\nI think I looked at you can follow those numbers against this current\nMakeup of Dodgers and I think collectively they have like a five thirty three O P s I've worked ... dollars so I think it makes sense I think getting those left these at Miller Park makes sense because it gets left handed hitters like max ... Peterson potentially out of the line up\nWith that porch and write that the ball kind of flights out too\nAnd uh then you go with the righty out at Dodger Stadium annually should seem so it makes sense to me on the surface we'll see how great council poison too I mean again I think we know that just because you can always is getting the Baltimore on I started the game that does not mean he's going to be on amount on the sixth inning by any stretch of the imagination\nLane great stuff as always appreciate the time enjoy your ...\nOf the imagination lane great stuff as always appreciate the time enjoy your evening and we'll see at the ballpark tomorrow Matt looking forward to it thanks so much like aren't very\nGood there's a link rental joining us here on brewers weekly aren't well open

I'll keep saying that you can you can go back to whatever you want to go back to and I've said this a playoff team I thought\nAt some point I was saying they're going to be competing for the play offs but I think the day to day choir Christian yell at each am Lorenzo gain the goal became the this is a playoff team they didn't make that move\nTo make it into the playoffs in twenty Nineteen they made that move to be a playoff team in twenty Eighteen Don is in Madison Hey Don thanks for calling your on WGM jak [noise]\nHey uh I uh I actually work and I thought I was back in Madison so I'm back here a guy in the Madison right now I'm two points one because I'm I'm kind of know here with the national\nI I really like the fact that they're going with tomorrow I'm I think that was a really sharp\nTrade and if you look at is performing\nCancer I mean that's really one of those deals new baseball all the time where like I might be struggling but there's a trade you give them a new venue you get this focus back and it it lightened\nAnd that's what we've seen so far away so I I\nThink that you know going to get it done around the block are not gonna get rattle too easily um for game one and I\nI really liked the fact that a count on that trigger\nA the second thing is I really like holding back just seeing a bill and three and and my thought is the worst case scenario is probably that they split the games in Milwaukee and so if if they go back\nTo LA a tight one why you want to get the momentum back and you take one of those games in LA to get back in Milwaukee so why not you know\nThree and and make your best effort to grab the momentum back\nAnd and uh\nAnd and go toe to toe with them and in their own so I'm curious what you're saying\nYeah down I appreciate the phone call and I I I especially like your second point\nOr ... dollars clearly change of scenery was was very good for him he looked different once he got to a Milwaukee and that was something that\nWorked out pretty well I mean the numbers don't lie on on Gonzalez he had a to point one three are a in five games with the brewers his he already was well north of four with the national so he he cut his DRA in half going from Washington to Milwaukee I don't have to sit here and expound on ... to to break that down that's pretty simple\nI Do think the thing about you know setting yourself up for\nA worst case scenarios they're down ... to go into Los Angeles by by dictionary definition\nThat's the worst case scenario but I Do think you need to go into those first two games at Miller Park and feel pretty confident that the brewers at the very least can win one of those first two games and if they do that\nAll of a sudden you go back into those three games in Los Angeles and all you have to do is when one of those to take home field advantage back\nWhere you know as Don just mentioned getting back to Milwaukee I Would take it one step further you at home field advantage back\nIf you can take care of business on your home field so I Do I I Do like the idea of your lease shot seen how David in could OSHA text in and say that a light likes to see a shot scene pitch there because a shot scene pitched on the west coast to pitch with ... with the Rockies knows how to pitch on the west coast I don't\nI don't think that plays into this at all if if they're if anything it's the familiarity of the Dodgers can help shot scene I don't take which you your plane that is going to help but I either way I liked the way how this all works out I'm more about the match ups at the end of the day\nThe Dodgers are not as good of a team against left hinders as they are against right hinders now you can say the exact same thing about the brewers and the Dodgers are going to ... to start the first two games\nOr was shot and here's your review and you look at what the brewers have done this year in the regular season\nOr against a left handed starters they were twenty foreign Nineteen yeah about five hundred that sounds good but it gets right handed starters they were Seventy two and forty eight so that's the challenge for the brewers because they have they've not been anywhere near as good against left handed starters\nAs they have been against right hand starters so that's another thing where you're where you're playing in the first two games doing what you need to do to find a way to win at least one of those two games if not both\nAnd you try to stack the deck where yeah the Dodgers are going with left his daughters in both those games what can you as the brewers due to weaken their position as much as possible you weaken their position by putting a left hand to start or on the mound yourself\nAnd then you let the whole thing play out\nFor one for

do recently really has made me hot under the color [noise]\n\nClerk reaches moment [noise]\nSo things are always going to come out you know Google had a data breach\nWhen Google had tried to compete with Facebook with this thing called Google Plus that didn't work at all and it was a big fail for Google and then on top of it there was a data breach that\nAre exposed people's personal information and Google chose to keep it secret\nBecause apparently they didn't want to ah hurt Google's reputation at a time where all the big tech companies are under a microscope so all they did was amplify\nThe damage done to them rather than just when you mess up you pass up period it's simple and all people to know that gosh Google certainly is\nOne of the companies that should know that if you do have a screw up with people's personal information you need to tell them\nThat there is something good coming out of this and that is that Google is launching a new initiative to make estimation through Gmail much more private\nAnd that's the direction they should be going but if you want to make sure that your emails are\nIs protected as I possibly could be use another free email service called proton mail which I mentioned to you before bed is an email service bit is ultra secure and private no prying eyes for search\nWhy don't you consider instead of using Google Search the

of getting back to a more normal\nEconomic environment and so as a stock investor I'm changing nothing because I Know this is part of the game as it goes through cycles if there was money that I had an stocks but I knew I was going to need to use\nAnd the next few years I Would be nervous because that money shouldn't be in stocks\nBut everything in life is about knowing the risk based on the time but you can afford to take risk\nSo money that you are putting in let's say is most people do most people's involvement with the stock market is through a four one K. or off the IRA\nAnd through a plan where you're invested in fines\nAnd if you're putting in each pay period or putting in regularly each month let's say in a Roth IRA\nDon't even Fred about any of this just remember that what happens today is pretty much irrelevant if you're ten or more years away from when you're going to need any of the money\nAnd you just keep going studies you go as long as the money you're putting aside in a retirement plan is well diversified well diversified what that means in simple English\nIs that having money and a variety of stocks not your employer zone factor percentage like you to have an employer's own stock in a four O. one K. is zero percent\nThat your money should be well spread out the easiest choice of investing bores you confuses you were intimidates you\nIs going to target retirement fund the you're offered where you work for the year closest to when you plan to retire and not necessarily from that company but you plan not to work anymore\nAnd and the Roth IRA again if the whole thing about how to pick and choose\nInvestments is not your thing\nGo into a target retirement fund because that is a simple way so you diversify your money across many different types of investments and you diversify overtime as long as you're doing those two things\nPutting money on regularly steadily for years to come\nWhatever they report about the dial up to Dallas down the S. and P. this yesterday that the NASDAQ whatever if all that ... fine is not important as long as you were doing the basics of putting the money aside each and every pay period each and every

great idea Dan is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Dan Hi clerk Dan how may I serve you\nWell I have a question about my daughter is traveling to Italy on a school trip and\nHow lucky is she she got to have fun you get to pay for it you stay home that doesn't sound like a deal to me\nIt doesn't sound fair I'm so her question is how ... what is the best way to bring spending money to Italy is because she is kind of shying away from using a debit card because of um identity theft issues\nHow old is your daughter she's twenty okay does she have any major credit card yet\nNo not yet she's tried to get a store credit card but she doesn't make enough money according to them to qualify for a credit card\nSo what I Would recommend in this case she very responsible as a person she is All right you know what I Would\nRecommend that you with your cards see which of your credit cards does not charge of foreign currency transaction junk the yup and do you know if any of yours or the free for foreign travel\nI'm not sure no I'd have to look into\nThat many cards you have I have to any chance one of them are capital one one is the capital one my odds that he would say yes capital one was the pioneer in issuing cars that don't charge foreign\nCurrency chunk fees yep just make sure that the capital one card you have doesn't charge those chunk phase okay and then get her an authorized user card you can get that like just a few days\nAnd she travels with that and with the beauty of that is that she can use it all across Italy and she will be able to\nPurchase things at once those bankers spying rate which is the actual real rate of transactions they would go on between the U.S dollar and the euro okay now as far as ATMs\nDo she have a a a credit union account or bank account or whatever\nYes a bank account regular savings account a checking account at a federal savings back\nOh and in a federal savings bank you don't hear about those much anymore now so to a federal savings bank those are those are kind of like almost like ... credit unions\nSo they may not charge of big fee for her using an ATM card to withdraw euros she needs them in Italy\nOkay yeah she was going to check into her back to see if what the fees were\nSo normally that's the best combination you have a major credit cards that charges no foreign currency drunk fees\nAnd you have an ATM card that doesn't hit you up with a bunch of drunk fees that an ATM give you a comparison most of the big banks charge a ten dollar per transaction fee when you withdraw money at an ATM outside the United states\nWow that's a law it is huge and so a lot of credit unions a usa as an example\nOf a bank that doesn't charge a fee when you use the ATM overseas oh in Charles Schwab stock brokerage she have any investments or do you have any investments for her\nYou'll see some of those very cheap choices for track phone's fine art Clark Spencer says I agree with you about the use of credit unions but I was thinking about using usa as my financial institution they call themselves a bank though what should I Do usa a bank is a great organization it is one of the nation's\nOne of the top two dozen banks and the country somewhere right in there it's a huge bank\nAnd they serve their members so well that I Would say usa a bank is an honorary credit union it's such a great thing to do

on the cars Howard show Chris you want to talk about finishing college but I'm I'm I'm thinking about how far along are you on your journey\nAnd then in a county program air I've gotten all the business classes all the accounting classes and all I have left for probably about twelve or so credit so\nYou know the standard math and English but the other stuff that I've been taking no one to two classes per semester take a break the last two semesters um and then actually ended up paying off a little bit of students that I could learn those few semester\nSo you're working full time and squeezing out around that picking up courses to get this going to be a bachelors or you're getting an accounting\nOr actually starting with the thirtieth and hopefully transfer\nVery good All right that's great how can I be of service cars you picked a great field\nSo well you know I'm working fulltime or six days a week or during the summer when we were almost sixty hours per week and um I work at a motorcycle shop so they aren't really enjoy what I Do but uh there's not a whole lot of room for\nThe answer is sure he uh he ended up in a job so I'm kind of the I'm thirty eight years old and I'm Wondering if uh should choose which my major to something a little more practical and technical or possibly\nWell I mean in counting it was a great field for you to transition into ... you're talking about getting an associates an accounting right yeah\nThat's a that's a wonderful field that I wouldn't switch gears on that matter if you finish the associates and so you said your twelve credit hours away see\nIs each course three credit hours that held the math works so you have born and where to go so you get the more and more courses done and you've been going to take that accounting degree and go get a job in that leave those motorcycle shop is that the\nThat that's what I'm planning on um I ... yeah I'm just not sure what jobs are available as far the accounting\nWould I Would do is I Would call one of the owners of a local CPA from okay yeah I thought about that\nAnd go sit down with the owners they're always looking for people to work doing accounting or various levels of bookkeeping and to go in and talk to one for advice is the first half do you are finding a place that may ultimately employ you\nConsider doing that I didn't know that was yeah ...\nYeah ... what are you all knew hundred percent\nBecca people love being asked for advice they generally don't like being asked for a job there so I think that what you've worked so hard to achieve complete\nJak at accounting degree get into that as a field and then see if you if you want to then go on while you're doing that and get a bachelor's in accounting go ahead if you decide after a while why did I think this is what I wanted to do then maybe you take your career path a different way\nBut I think he picked a great field\nIt takes a special person to work sixty hours a week and go to school you are that person you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nOn your score effectively what mortgage interest rate you'll get and what your monthly payments will be on that mortgage when you get the home\nSo this is a simple math than\nThe lenders when they're evaluating your credit or when the credit bureaus who they're scoring model or through the one that most lenders use for a mortgage the my psycho people the psycho score\nHow much of the credit you have as a ... percent you're using currently directly translates into several hundred points of your credit score\nIf I wanted to be exact it's nearly three hundred points\nAnd so that wasn't exactly I Would stay close approximation [laughter] but you get the idea so when you are applying for a mortgage is gonna sound weird\nBut your which does your utilization of credit cards in order to get the very best interest rate on a mortgage needs to be below ten percent that means and simple math view of ten thousand dollars available credit on credit cards\nYou want to charge on them in a month less than one thousand dollars or manipulate the score\nBy sending in payments to your credit card company before your billing cycle closes so that you're essentially pre paying that much balance before it would generate\nAnd that can move your score big time\nOr the other huge chunk of what makes up your credit score is paying your bills on time every month\nAnd if you have had a problem with that that's not easily heal that one takes ... significant time but if you are\nGoing for a home and mortgage\nAt least four months out I Need you to get copies of all three of your credit reports and you do that an annual credit report dot com completely free\nAnd look for any note pays or late pays for particularly no pace and unpaid balance uh most of the time it'll be for some medical thing you didn't even know your money on and you want to take care of those\nBecause that is an important factor in underwriting\nBut remember the most important factor\nIn terms of getting a quick jump on that score stop using your credit cards Jennifer joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello Jennifer\nHow\nI'm doing great thank you and you have\nA mortgage\nTo pay for it\nSo tell me or you just starting a mortgage are you in it and they're offering you a bi weekly\nFar\nOut of all of them are weaker offering oh [noise]\nOkay so what are they gonna charge you to go from paying your mortgage monthly to paying a bi weekly\nFat for for\nFor free really\nFrom what I thought it said [noise] I like [noise] [noise]\nWell that is a great question and there are a number of programs\nWhere you can pay your mortgage bi weekly but it is not it's not really doing what you think because they do just what you said you pay the money to them half a monthly mortgage payment every other week\nAnd then by the end of the year you've made the equivalent of one extra pain that since there's\nFifty two weeks in a year you've made twenty six half payments are Thirteen full payments and I'm looking at the website of its Quicken Loans is here mortgages with\nRight and they say free and sample other companies charge a fee and they say it's completely free with no extra fees and when you make the payment very sliding uh gosh it exactly like I Do that you've made an additional payment\nAnd they talk about the set up and all that it's the first time I've ever seen one\nThat allows you to do this once you have a loan in place completely free but it does not say in the explanation\nIf they're just holding your money for that whole year and then making the one additional payment for you at the end of the year\nSo you're right past that question but I'm starting because I don't recall anybody ever offering this as a freebie\n[laughter] [noise]\nYeah I mean if you if you if it works for you to get paid every other week\nNow [noise] [noise]\nOh well that works the same yeah so if you want to do this in ... years off you're alone and they're not going to charge you anything for it\nI think it's great\nBrian is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brian cyclic area great thank you Brian you did a good job you save money at your own job yeah I tried to well that's great how can I be of help with that\nWell I just recently started a new job and the previous employer and this current on both as four one K. matches or they're managed by different companies and I'm Wondering what to do with my old four one K.\nAnd how much did you have in that old four one K.\nShift a little bit less than Seventy three thousand\nOkay that's great that's great to see how old you are Brian\nI'm forty six okay\nSo you know you want that piled or grow and grow and grow so they are you can have a point that you can retire and comfort in that retirement and building up that four one K. money is great your new employer the match they have how do they do that one\nUh it's just a direct eight percent that they put in\nNo way to do you put in money and they'll pop in another eight percent\nI don't have to put in any I Do but they they will put in eight percent\nWow I'm In the wrong business or whatever busier at that very generous you know\nYes that is so the the question on the old plan since the amount of money you have a minute it is completely your choice\nIf you will have the money there or you move it to the new employer and the way I'd decide is it the old employer plan is a one of the ultra low cost four one K. plans\nI Would leave the money behind on the other hand if you're a new employer has an ultra low cost four one K. plan then it would make a lot of sense to move the money\nAnd if both plans are kind of\nEqual and cost then you could either move the money to the new plan or put it in your own IRA that do you have to have any information on the kind of cost structure that you have with either the plans\nI Do not I don't know that\nSo that would be key for you and making a decision because over time over the next Twenty years till you hit the key to retire you know mid forties when most people were just hire mid sixties the costs and the plan\nHave a massive effect on how much money you actually end up with it\nS of effect on how much money you actually end up with at the end of the day okay so do the lowest cost plans in America are offered by one company and that's banned guard\nAnd so if either your plans or vanguard then you'd want to operate based on the factors vanguard plan for your whole plan was vanguard plan where you put money behind if you're a new plan\nIs vanguard plan then you'd want to move the old employer money from the old employer into the new importer vanguard plan if it's not vanguard then you've got to go a step further and dig in\nAnd see what the costs actually are in\nJust for frame of reference how many people work for the company you're working for now for a fortune five hundred company\nOkay so the costs on the plan all and should be less than one half of one percent\n[noise] okay and it is managed by banger my new company and\nSo then if it is a vanguard plan move the money from the old plan roll it over into the new company plant okay and you and centers or vanguard plan you don't even have to worry what the expenses are going to be because I'll tell you they're going to be ...\nOkay

WGM Jay will start at five o'clock with brewers tonight\nNFL we'd six it was the eagles all over the giants thirty for Thirteen ... news radio WGM Jay\n[noise]\nThank you for being with us on the ... from Westwood One radio where is one eight six six five oh Jim both one eight six six five oh five or six to six [noise] online you'll find as a jumbo had a show dot com you can\nFollow me on Twitter at the gym Botox has got to be talking to life about parenting and a couple of terms that had been used over the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been reached by our guest Dr John Huber a clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health Dr Huber thank you for being with us tonight\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll the first term is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term of ... referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make some mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nI'm not sure that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nAt because their parents those types of things [noise]\nAll right uh that's something else that it it seems to me that\nLeft the generation that has provided us with a helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably we're not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean a ... it's hard for me to to think that uh\nBefore this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that have parents that are essentially provided the role models for these people uh it it seems to me that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own end of the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back that many generations does it\nDoesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation of there's a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents had to have had to scrimp and save and do without during the war and so\nA protective of their kids they make a lot more parents look like like you know kindergarten versus college\nAh Levi on more parents literally mowed down any obstacles any threats of confrontation any chance of failure for their kids which\nYou know a rational adult understands failure for children as a learning opportunity and teach you how to deal with loss and how to how to recover from that and build on your experiences and these kids are\nI'm getting much less of that than the helicopter kids from the helicopter\nSo it's getting worse the helicopter parents on steroids\nExactly exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others that tonight the dog who calls him from Albany, Oregon\nAt the weather channel and even though and they're good at doing fine\nDuring hurting myself I just got to say the helicopter and got warm or parents sound like the kind of parents are we're glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles Tibet responsible\nNow you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much there to adopt some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think that the dog maybe closer to the literal truth that he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI told you the exactly correct unfortunately\nWhat that Creole too is a a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely entitled they deserve this and you know I was taught right off day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thought Saddam because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo me right now I you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure the than I Do any of these people granted I I I ... the the young people I Know of by by that by my definition I'm Talking about the\nAh parents' today's parents who are generally of course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not in this category uh I mean they may do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and just set includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself abducted yourself off and and the whole learning experience\nIs there any kind of a of a originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have ever actually match a helicopter parents much less a lot more parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily region analogy I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six into two thousand Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents go what do you mean my travel got us thirty on there yeah and I go I Can't even confirm it your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what you mean I go where you are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't just you know\nYou used to be when I got thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level Mardi Gras for high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me about their child great [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens above that that does almost daily literal helicopter\nOr this case an airline I guess a remarkable All right uh Greg in Springfield, Missouri joined us or the jumbo had a show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\n... a doctor I miss question are okay I've got I've got a one year old grandson on kind of worried about situations the daughter wall or maybe I don't even know if she'd be considered a lot more ... it is something else going on me\nShe obsessed with taking pictures I Love your death if he stands that you know like the only baby it's ever done it and she won't even let them\nSo like what myself grab a ... office we go there and grab and it's always on top of all you know it it can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get into the germs you know it's like real low lowest worried about I mean\nOr maybe you should be more than almost worried uber Dr Huber sounds to me like get Greg may have found an example here\nI might have but I'm I'm assuming this is her first child\nI buy that graves ...\nOkay and you know at first child you know like the kids are at the store or the or in the living room they spent their pacifier out and you got to go stick it in boiling water for him as he can put it in a ... by by the time she has her third kid she become dusted off it doesn't matter she didn't know where to get up out of gathering dust\nOff now so the more it that'll change how well she jobs\nTo pass by she goes by they was doing\nA well All right oh yeah the ... and why is it yeah going going way longer\nYeah Rome I heard that you know you you're raising a child and grandchild or you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah a reminder that you know you you raise the child and grandchild or you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here I Am a doctor you were I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah\nThey have a common enemy okay a little cynicism there for the program I Love it it's a job in Port ... Washington really been job\nOh gentleman I see a lot of things to generate showed up your mom just the amount of legislation that's out there that you're a seat the judiciary the child is ... ... people\nIn a good indicator dish\nDrink get word of ... got your your child got injured or did you leave it to play in the yard and this happened or the chart if you're the car seat issue who your do you have the right one for your ... that that age are there there there's a whole lot of stuff that\nYou would never even dreamed up as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church is right\nAnd and my parents never would've dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand Jared state or local level [noise] uh so that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering that are used right up trucks predators are fifty three Chevrolet pickup truck and hang out with a\nTruck yeah we can All right and the bad and the truck now yeah exactly you are now\nAt ... and and it does you know the things I could take out but you guys go out ... ... ... ...\nWell that your your thoughts atop a to what extent it has a government if not imposed this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from a government and I'm here to help and running and and what happens\nIs you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand up in front of a school board then governor meeting\nOn our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things in post now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with that but you know uh I've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of\nPeople following a pediatricians word to the letter a on a first child or something and the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know they can't ... you don't wait three hours to feed them even though I said you know do you every three hours\nAnd all of a sudden you get a child protective services involved\nThat because yeah the kids take being taken up the hospital because we have cry all the time and the other they think oh they're not\nFeeding a kid and the mother's like no I'm just like the doctor told me every three hours\nAnd it's crazy yeah it's scary for new parents especially young when\nAnd uh they\nThey follow those rules and then what happens with care they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey your parents do this this child abuse of your parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says ... ... really you can do parents you know what you can\n[noise] well uh suffice it to say it would somehow it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and other people in the audience managed to get here a\nCourtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess the the the old methods at least a do not a cause a ... a tremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from that we'll talk some more about this tonight this tendency\nIn the direction of not just helicopter parents bunch\n... parents I mean at some point or this has to be arrested has to be stopped one eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment\nTo wake up with I literally had moments before I was driving through the market interchange I always get morning again you have that rain storm last night it was coming down so they use that news candidates for the

organized will uh will become politically active will elect people who are who we agree\nI I think she was they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of places where the problem with these kids they don't know how to problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections you know somebody said she had the process\nAnd they used to teach civics and then suddenly the more I I had that that they do that's also part of the problem\nYeah but what you just said it was very telling Linda they don't know how to problem solve come ... hill is the point of raising a kid if you do at the end of the day produced someone who can problem solve I mean\nI as true why have them [laughter] you\nKnow seriously why have a kid and you can't just be doing it out of cruelty less producer a human being who will split failed miserably who will slump in life and and do all we can to to handicap dumb and nobody says that there is what they're doing\nThe guy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that Republicans are running the country or\n... again it's it's if you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do something about it do suck your bomb and organize I mean I I may I Will be out there are those of you and I hope that I don't step on your precious little self esteem\nBut that's one of the political debates all about if you feel that way they do something about it all out\nI went into this whole still ISIS problem is that the school she took control your kids [noise] yeah they became the parents in many cases here you have to have to say anything or not going to win it PTA meetings the old way they used to in place there you know\nWell and if they do go to complain about the about their kids don't want our guest to comment on what ... does that say which I think is a lot to Dr Huber\n[noise] she she has a lot and there's a lot of validity to that the schools\nYou know they they used to be locally controlled and now they're they're nationally control than just like what what they need in in their state in in California or Washington state\nIs different than what they made in Florida and Texas and Georgia and New York straight you know we need to I think my history of the school psychologist tells me we need to go back and let the states\nStarts setting a the the standards of what their kids need to learn their at because our federal government has dropped out of the picture as far as you know they don't even requires recommend

smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do that [laughter] um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check\n'em but not as alone more as ... you know they might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\nWhat kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called event and they're only client right now is Wal Mart but they say they're going to be expanding a chart just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interest that you can pay on a on a payday loan if it's relatively small\nUm I Try to another company called daily pay and days and therapy they're more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know in\nAn inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than from the interest rates ended up being free as I mentioned in the end\nAnd play but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reason for not I think going into that story I thought you know there must be some tax free than or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that um their contract with that company depends on how many times\nThey have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria Lamont yet Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nTo it already is actually um you know who burned left our two companies that compete with each other\nVery um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they've worked with a company called green dot to do that and square um and so now that those\nType of ... workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payments cycles\nUm you know every day workers are now saying we I Know someone that get paid every day or every ride why can't the top and for me so that conversation it's already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the school for that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide that meals\nA nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday\nJust to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal that\nChild might be getting you know during the during the school day period\nSo a daycare has been a really big issue but and you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district she use for day and and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not\nWant it but didn't they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's not let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to\nGet away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents\nStarted out not liking it but they ended up liking it\nTurned out I guess the biggest question at twenty thousand dollar question what kind of an impact does this have on learning do we know yet\nYou know and I've looked at

scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days during the Cold War that's how that's how they sell 'em but academics we haven't really seen

fear is a motivator\nBut beyond that her point is adults are supposed to be role models for children and and I certainly don't disagree with us here here's the problem though [noise]\nAnd I mentioned this on the earlier this week in the long segment that I did on this all this really changed here is\nDemocrats see someone who's a bigger bully than they are bullying has been a part of American politics for some time now for Republicans conservatives felt that they were the ones getting bullied that\nIs how Donald Trump got elected I think even some people who voted for I'm surprised at\nWhat he is willing to do and the things he was willing to say [noise]\nAnd that's really what Hillary Clinton and holder or talking about is not hiding it anymore\nI made the comparison to colonel just up in the movie a few good men in that famous\nSpeech on the stand in the trial\nJack Nicholson is colonel ... says you know Europe parties and this and you don't want to pretend I'm there doing what I have to do for you [laughter] well in modern politics they don't hide the criminal justice up anymore that's all Hillary Clinton\nUh holder or talking about his you know what we're not we're not going to hide it anymore so Republicans don't hide their colonel jobs that pay more so we're not gonna hide ours\nAnd my response to that is one I have been highly critical of the president's behavior and you know a lot of things getting checked off the conservative agenda doesn't change my position on that\nAnd it was a problem you have is when someone who is a Republican or conservative his way to criticize behavior of the left you just you have no credibility and doing it if you just turn a blind eye to what President Trump is doing\nWhat you have here is look\nThe Democrats did not take the high road in the whole Kavanaugh\nThey got to where a guy because they didn't take the high road because one Senator Dianne Feinstein didn't do the right thing when she got the information and to and really to his number one they they demonized having all before the the allegations from Christine Blasey Ford\nThey considered him an evil based on this judicial ideology or I should say philosophy\nSo that that's that's just that's not the high road\nPeggy Noonan has I think what is an excellent column on this today's Wall Street journal I Want to share it with you and a couple of

tip my hat is brilliant\nIn the way that he does it\nWhen he came out after the confirmation any just both barrels against Christine Blasey Ford it was clear clear why\nHe was trying to incite them into protesting and get it because they just vented outside ways\nAnd it's very very effective\nI mentioned that it's it's affected for him as I mentioned\nPeggy Noonan I has a vote I consider a peace related on this I'm going to get it started here will finish it up after the news\nVoices of reason and on the reason Peggy Noonan today's Wall Street journal\nWhat did the cabinet controversy tell us about our historical moment it underscored what we already know that America is politically and culturally divided and that activists and the two parties soldiers disagree\nWith each other but dislike and distrust each other I Would argue bordering on hating each other and public opinion surveys bear that out\nWe also do the Supreme Court has come to be seen not only as a constitutional and inevitably political body but as a cultural body the follows cultural current moods assumptions it has frequently brushed past the concept of democratic modesty to make decisions that would\nMost

nominations to the court will inevitably drop passion and this was a fifth can serve it at the seat on a nine person court but\nFor the cabinet hearings had some new elements there were no boundaries

believes he told her the idea of precedent as not only a practice of tradition but tenet rooted in the constitution as dumb as Ford's charges since the confirmation process is not a trial the rules are more elastic\nBut certain fundamentally legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence and fairness do Baron my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nWe must always remember she wrote that it was when passions are most inflame the fairness is most in jeopardy\nThat will Susan Collins Peggy Noonan rights she calls with a gang rape charging outlandish allegations of no credible

further from the truth\nThe atmosphere surrounding the nomination has been politically charged there reached a fever pitch even before the forward and the other charges\nThat has been challenging to separate fact from fiction but a decision must be may judge Kavanaugh's record has been called one of the exemplary public servant judge teacher coach husband and father for hope is he will work\nOut that he will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we are far fewer five four decisions and so the public confidence that our judiciary at our highest court is restored and so she said she would vote to confirm it was a master class and with a friend called old style thrown this combined with the feeling for justice\nOr word on the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic party\nThe Halloween and screeching that interrupted the hearings and the voting the people who call them the door of the court the ones who chased senators to the halls and screamed at them in elevators who surrounded and harassed one at dinner with his wife\nWho disrupted him brought an air of chaos who attempted to Fort democratic process is so that the people could

walking around the city over the course of the last four days and you feel it\nAnd you know how big of a deal this is to the city and there's such a buzz about the brewers I think the players feel that they they're not blind to that they're going to see that and they get they hate the stakes are are huge here and we have a chance to do something really special mattress for this organization\nNot just for ourselves for an entire community and for an entire state in many ways with the state of Wisconsin I don't think that's lost on these guys for a second but as Mike most doctors said all that build up and all that stuff you can't really avoid it but then once the game starts it's baseball\nAnd I think that for a lot of the veteran guys that's what this will be one of the game gets going uh this will become baseball to them again and in some ways that might be one they're the most comfortable\nIn a lot of ways to a guy like weight Miley might be more comfortable out on the mound competing\nThan he is doing pre game press conferences with\nYou know sixty some people staring back at him that's not exactly his favorite element uh learns the pain that love doing that either I mean they do those things because that's a part of their gig but were they were the most comfortable is on the field competing so I think once the first pitch happens and McCain gets underway for a lot of these guys it turns back into baseball again for them\nOne of the great voices the market ... joining us for a few more moments\nSo Ryan Braun one of those veterans who's been here before what what level of experience what what can he tell his teammates to kind of a maybe a calm down some of that tension and help them uh hopefully move forward to the world series what can you bring to the table\nWhile he's given a speech at every stop along the way with the the clenching celebrations and he's been the first guy to speak or in this club house and talk about hey this is a great celebration let's make sure it's not our last if more things we want to accomplish\nThe lights get bigger the state gets bigger um but at the same time you know we got to just keep doing what we're doing this kind of in his message over the course of these last three celebrations but I think those words matter so much more because of the way he's been playing when things got\nSerious towards the end of September when the brewer started making their run ... the entire season and there were games where he carried this team and I think that matters just as much as words and the way he's been performing\nIt's been a huge deal if you look at the brewers against left handed pitching they're going to see a lot of it in this series and they went out and they added Jonathan scope and and and that has helped to a degree obviously there's been some mixed results with Jonathan scope at the plate but he has provided some big moments at the plate to\nBut I think the two things are on top of that that have really made the brewer so much better and more balanced when Mondays are on the mound than where they were maybe earlier in the season is the way Ryan bronze playing right now\nBut also the emergence of the two catchers and crafts and putting those two guys are swinging it very well also and it's just and and really if you go one step further than that land or sea has been much more effective at the plate over the last two or three weeks\nAnd so when you have all those guys performing from the right side just makes you better against the left handed pitching that you're going to face throughout your line up um but I think Ryan Braun experience matters he certainly come a big big moments over the course of his career he has been a klutz she had her\nFor the brewers we all understand that and there have been games over the last three weeks or so during this winning streak Ryan Braun is kind of put the team on his back and\nThat's what makes this seems so good it can be Christian yell at age it can be might move stock is with the big tempting walk off it can be Lorenzo can it can be Ryan Braun there are just so they can be ... there are so many guys that can hurt you in this line up and that's why the brewers never feel like they're down and out even if they're behind\nBecause they know there's somebody around the corner somebody on deck and step up and provide the big moment if they don't do it\nIt was an ounce of lingering you got to be excited about calling this a series as well\nYeah I I'm I'm just excited to be there you know ... this this this is a one of those things where I Know this is my third year calling major league baseball games I've been a fan my whole life I've called\nGames at different levels my whole life and to get to this point at any level is so hard to do and it doesn't happen every year and you never take it for granted and so I think it's important that you enjoy\nThe ride and you you have fun with it but at the same time I I the thing that I'm the most excited about is is these guys getting a chance to perform and they said because the brewers have been kind of underdogs and then ask them over the course here\nAnd that's no more and now they're on the big stage because they've earned their right to be here and everybody's talking about the brewers nice guys have to work this kind of no use among so I'm trying to see it's fun for me to see these guys get that kind of attention because they work really hard they're great group of ... and they have fun playing the game they play at the right way\nAnd joined the series were announcers brewers announcer lingering do great to talk to you you but Thanks Steve for she ate it\nMore brewers we're going to do a lot of brewers on the show

S. as we had to the un out see us today tonight rather game one brewers Dodgers I Am live from Miller parts these pretty joining on this Friday thank the jury beta for doing a flip to that typically amount of year in the mornings but I wanted to be a part of this uh this brewer success story\nNow we're going to do about a half hour of non brewers that's the only non brewers are only the only numbers around during the show today so we're going to spend some time in the next half are talking about two things one\nWas also a referendum against Hillary Clinton and the Clintons in general and I I this isn't to also breaking any news and and I said this before [noise]\nHillary Clinton lost probably the most winnable election and the history of presidential elections unless you did it in a number of ways she her strategy was flawed her absence from some key states that she needed to win and beyond the example Wisconsin which hadn't gone for a Republican in a long time\nSo she followed that that election but Donald Trump has to be given credit for winning that election for doing it the right way for astounding not only a lot of voters in in this country and its and frankly the voters in California is still reeling from twenty sixteen and has it as my uh\nOccasional guest on this show Dennis Miller likes to say they still haven't gotten over twenty sixteen and and I know a lot of people who live in California that's the way they feel but this president is popular despite all the tweets and all the missteps and which I cited on numerous occasions in Charlottesville\nWhere he compared Nazi sympathizers to the the other protesters as if they were equal and on equal footing which is frankly ridiculous\nAnd missteps in his treatment of women and his comments regarding world leaders very much a a leader of the free world who is learning on the job which is one thing to be a business leader\nIt's a whole nother thing to be president United States and this president has certainly has has had its challenges but I just wanted to highlights [noise]\nThen after five hundred days this president\nIs still popular among Republicans and conservatives and while there probably won't be any challengers I'd be surprised if there weren't twenty twenty\nThey're still going to be questions about that whether somebody is willing to go up against this president and of course a lot depends on what happens between now and uh this is really the the ramp up\nOf the of the election process and twenty Nineteen but for a lot of Republicans and conservatives\nThey're still giving him a pat on the back and that's that's the reality of politics today when you were entrenched in your own camp it takes a lot to get out of that hole and or frankly they haven't seen that so far after the break I'm going to tell you I'm going to paraphrase because I Can't use the words that he used\nWhat Kanye West said in his Oval Office conversation yesterday with the presidents and uh some of it is astounding\nAnd shocking and something about it actually makes a little bit of a sense of well I'll tell you what that all sounds like\nA from the

Schroeder the rock and I think is more commonly known as and he joined us good afternoon\nThanks for having me I've been a big Mitt kind of a busy man today you know I don't get a chance to do the games any more I mean yeah we bought these guys up into the\nInto the playoffs and uh they kind of dumb plus they leave us at the altar so I'm doing a bunch of interviews I Apologize for being late over the period on the M. O. B. network real quick I have my times wrong as they told me to Fifteen but it was two Fifteen eastern I Need to check my emails a little bit closer\nNo apologies needed I Want to ask you are going around the brewer so long just like I had actually we're both born in Nineteen fifty eight how about that [noise] um yeah that makes us it makes us sixty years old but um let me ask you about this team compared to all the other teams you've seen what's unique about this twenty Eighteen version of the more the brewers\nIsland this team uh I don't think they know you know what the word pressure means and um\nYou know try and letting you know pressure and out our pressure to get to them and mean that the loose group and that all stars were great counseling is even keel [noise]\nGuys are able to really be themselves they have a good time and have dug out but when push comes to shove these guys are\nPlaying some good baseball it has been unique in watching Craig cancer navigate this pitching staff I mean I Know that's that's the big word around baseball you know right now is the fact that you know the initial out getters as Craig likes to talk about you know the starters when you can almost\nTo talk about you know the starters when you can also that you don't know how long he's going to go but this bullpen\nHas been as good a bullpen as we've seen in baseball for a while you know and that's what is going to get you into the play offs and what you did get you in the play authors brewers into the play offs and\nThey will carry you through it you know the Kansas City royals is a good example not that long ago so it's important to have a good book and the brewers have as good a bullpen has any team in the playoffs right now and [noise]\nUm I think that's the biggest difference I think when Craig council feels like he has a lead fourth or fifth inning you got to feel pretty comfortable about still getting the rest of the way through the game with the outstanding and\nTalking to bill Schroeder the rock that the Iraqis had a great office shut them down the Dodgers are next level up what do you expect to see in the series we talked about the great pitching the brewers have is it good enough to to to shut down that Dodgers off and it's\nNo doubt I mean the question I think should be or you know the Dodgers starting rotation is is very good there's three left hand is in there and that's going to have a heavy emphasis on the brewers right handed batters I mean we talked about yellow ...\nAnd his successor against left these um this year hitting a three twenty five or so against left handed pitching and um I think you know Ryan Braun and have to say you learn the Bruce catching core\nCrash and ... have been swinging back very well Jonathan scopes going to play an important part in what's going on here Lorenzo came so I think it's going to be important to be able to get to this starting rotation of the Dodgers it starts out with Clinton curve show here tonight which is no certainly no slouch the brewers are hit I'm fairly well as of late but Clinton Herschel\nWho's coming off a really good performance or you know against the Braves or a scoreless innings but um [noise] I think it's a it's going to be a you know the battle for the brewers is going to be getting to the starting rotation getting into the Dodgers bull fan as soon as you can [noise]\nTalking to bill Schroeder who's been around this team for almost as long as anybody else maybe not as long as Bob euchre but when we talk about playoffs the tension the excitement fans are certainly going to be ramped up does it get to the team to it does every level of playoffs ratcheting up a bit\n... and a Christian ... said it you know couldn't set it any better and the players Tribune article that he wrote that\nYou know the fans here at Miller Park and even the fans around town these guys cruise around town and they see all the brewer paraphernalia and the [noise] um you know all the signs and people are excited about you know the brewers again I mean that churches these guys up and it's been that way you know all season long I mean you know the brewers draw extremely well given the market\nYou know the market size that they are the parameters that they weren't in and it's been one of the reasons why this team has been so energized and\nYou'd be able to get these performances out of these players because of the brewer fan base has been there from day one even in the lean years there's no good support and um you know we'll everybody says they have the best friend in baseball but then we know the joke to point eight million fans for regular seasons\nYou know schedule in Milwaukee is a is a credible and it continues and they were really loud against the Colorado Rockies and they were into it and\nI'm looking forward to this I mean I I'm just excited as any fan that's going to be out there of course I'm going to be a fan because I'm not doing the game so\nI can scream and yell as well so um you know the fans play a big part in this and the players feet off the energy that they bring to the ballpark each and every day not just in the playoffs but in April games you know a pro games against the Miami Marlins to say you know not to minimize that but uh you know they'd been behind the brewers all season long\nWe've got about a minute left with Bill the rock Schroeder let's let's we know the stars yell at you and Braun who could be a star for the brewers that maybe we're not thinking about in the series\nMother's been you know aircraft try to big series against Colorado you know don't forget about the Lorenzo came he's kind of the guy who gets things going in ... in the early part of the playoffs yeah well\nYou know I get and so they they they're still able to win games even though maybe you know can't and yell at each\nYou know they didn't really have to rely on them as heavily as they have throughout the season and [noise] you know I think that I'm I'm looking for Jonathan scope to have a good play off so I think it's going to be a tournament Jonathan to swing the bad all these less painters or the Dodgers offer um I'm going to

afternoon to Wisconsin and we are live from Miller Park that's I'm I've been saying that throughout the whole short I'm sitting in the same spot I was an April second against the cardinals that when they kicked off their uh their season the twenty eighth\nVersion of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball and here we are gave one else cs brewers Dodgers will be a first pitching tonight what is it about seven o'clock I think seven o'clock our local time and boy there's a lot of people\nExcited maybe a little bit nervous about what might happen I wanted to play a piece for my radio partner bill study\nHe's the guy that kind of is the guy behind the guy you know we all know the the story of Bob euchre legendary Mr Hollywood Mr baseball hall of fame broadcaster but there was another guy that uh helps Bob be as good as he is in the great ... bills that did a piece on him I Want to play for you right now\nBut sometimes it can be a distraction as well I think uh you know there's no\nThere's no heat are heading there is no you know one exact wage so I'm you know you you can we can definitely use that to get guys within a rangers closer or also just a ease their mind on like\nThe mechanical site if they're if everything looks good Scrooge technology or [noise] or some of the ah blasts notion and stuff like that then they they don't have to worry so much about mechanics and think that they have to rebuild their swing because so much of its mental anyway rarely\nI Do you guys get so far out of whack mechanically that that's the issue it's usually\nIt's usually been you know in the head and and confidence more and more so than eating [noise]\nCan you make changes\nBased on an ash bat or is it more long term them out as a hitting coach [noise]\nUh it's it's usually over the long haul it's it's you know there might be a certain keys that that uh you can\nYou can remind a guy that that are like his ... that that sort of get him\nBack to square so to speak but [noise]\nYou can't do a whole lot whole lot of that in game you know we we try to reach that we you know we do our work we prepare for the game and then once once again starts it's [noise] it's about just competing it's about a dog by up there and and whatever you have\nBut talking to Jason Lane one of the hitting coaches for the ... who's impressed you or as a player this year who's kind of made some incredible progress when it comes to their at bats and and and they're often as a Milwaukee Brewers ... who stands out in your mind\nAh well I think I think a\nFirst off his shoes Aguilar get the chance to play every day in and taking advantage of that and doing what he's done has been been really impressive [noise]\nUm I think what he did last year in Israel as a as a\nTime player in off the bench guy\nWas even more impressive because I I Know both those roles personally in in that role is it's so tough and and to produce the way he did last year\nA sort of earn them the right when the opposite he came to to play every day this year in Grand but take advantage of that\nThroughout the throughout the season I think as\nHas been great but we've had we've had so many guys you know I think ah [noise]\nI heard on for as it's been been a great bad for us off the bench um [noise]\nAnd even even like Domingo Santana who had had a rough first happened went down to AAA and and they came back and got some big picture tourist off the bench\nOr after you know probably being frustrated he spent some time the minor leagues but he he got some huge ... home runs for us and can should double and and off the mansion really bought into that role when he got back here and and obviously you know works with things out down there and and was a big part of a September ... the playoffs instill\nStill a big part of our playoff run 'em\nGetting some ... here in the playoffs event\nI'll give you the opportunity brag a little bit how much of a Christian yell at your success can you take credit for\nI [laughter] I I Can't take a whole lot I mean it's it's been it's been so great\nTo watch and and and you know learn from from a great player you know I I pride myself on [noise]\nOn learning every day as as well as these guys are hopefully learn too and I'm just to see his\nHis understanding of its own swing and um his routine is his discipline\nA day in and day out\nAnd and just to watch them mentally go through all of that it has been\nOne of the more impressive things to deal with um [noise]\nYou know that last month and and and the run he made to get into like the triple crown race but not ever letting that\nTake away from us needing wins and ah you know we had some conversations the last week about wild man the ...\nThe city's right there I never would have thought that\nAnd then I I think that's why it's right there because he\nI've watched you never think about it and you just played baseball and [noise] you know it's either going to work out or it's not based on you just find baseball and and\nHe's here to win games for the team and and the games are ordered them that way and and he's he's had a great season [noise]\nI heard some of the experts on and I'll be talking about are you also swing and it reminded them of Barry Bonds the smoothness of it how easy it seems [noise] do you see that same thing as well [noise]\nYeah I mean he's he's he's very naturally very smooth you know he has the had Barry over in ah Florida Marlins as as a hitting coaches and\nYou know he's he's she shared some stories about what they used to talk about how they used to joke and and uh [noise]\nYou know his his second half of the seasons rivals rattled I think are so seasons that Barry had like consecutively so that's how impressive very was the man or a yeah he\nHe's just a natural hitter that that has a really good understanding and and I think\nBeyond his latest mechanics competitive nature is what\nReally such a little far from from a lot of guys to seek quietly to teach seriously in the box and em wants to win and I think that [noise] so much as adults them so much of what are\nSome guys don't pay attention to often enough that I experienced you know being a pitcher and a hitter I I\nI experience both sides and realize hey\n... you can get you out so you ... what do you think you can beat him you know 'cause I [noise] I promised most of them say they get ya so [noise]\nHe does a great deal of traits it it's great to talk to you or Jason Lane outfielder pitcher and now hitting coach for the brewers I enjoy the heck out of the series was the Dodgers [noise]\nAll right we're going to have some fun and thanks for having me now [noise]\nAbsolutely great to talk to you Jason Lane not one of the hidden coaches for the brewers as I said and a boy you love to hear those stories are you you watch Christian yell at you\nWhen you hear him described in terms of a Barry Bonds and and the smoothness and easing herself a swing it's not surprising that he's a ... probably more than likely going to the MVP of the national league as we are so we had the game one of the CS brewers Dodgers were alive for Miller Park I got about a half hour or more\nBefore we had it off the John Melissa but before we get there I'm going to ask you guys are question you listeners out there is this the best brewers baseball team you've ever been a

tidbit Curtis greater ... member of the brewers a year ago at this time\nWas playing in the ... yeah there was a member of the Dodgers\nThere was nobody the brewers clubhouse more familiar with the Dodgers of their way of doing things that Curtis Granderson who joined us of Wisconsin's after new news earlier today\nI'll give you that love Curtis graders to jog Curtis thanks for joining us manage it crazy what difference a year make a year ago you were playing with the teams that you know facing and the doctor is probably the way the world series practice\nThe crazy part about baseball you know growing up watching it you always saw guys play with the team for ten Fifteen Twenty years and now you know you're likely to see a guy play with a team for a year though you know a lot of switching and guys moving teams are switching up but that's what makes a lot of fun you\nMove through the stages of the play offs here Curtis does anything said is there a mentality you sort of shift at all or is it is with all of that you don't do or die kind of\nAtmosphere I still got to be exact same way you know you're in a situation where you've got to try to win a series in both teams are trying to do that right now we've been doing that for a good part of the last month fear health food continue to keep that thing going by starting with his first came here tonight\nWill be celebrated the bet a lot of fog would it be cool to do and actually at Miller Park you know\nWe don't mind where we do as long as we get a chance to celebrate it you know and hopefully the fans are with us whether they're in the stadium or they're traveling on the road like they've been doing so well up to the point or you know watching it on TV you know the fan base has been amazing you know hopefully no matter where we get a chance to celebrate everybody's a part of\nI don't think there was anyone in the ... who does the Dodgers better than you what sort of resource if you've ever for the rest of the guys\nYou know what I tried my best to bring as much information as I can to these guys but again it's been a year so a lot of things have changed you know what that organization and I was only there for a little bit but I myself have ... you know by plane was shot over there we're trying our best to provide as much influence we can but they're also doing the same thing I'm sure the Dodgers and their organization from what I remember being with them a\nVery good job of with her advance scouting and their pro scouting and trying to figure out what our game plan and the fact is going to be over the course of the series straighter\nJoining us on the program Curtis you also do a lot of acquaintance ... tonight start or what is it about him that that makes them for such a challenging at fast\nYou know what he's attempting to aggressive he's also very confident and wants to ball he definitely going to come at you and you have to really good approach\nAnd get each individual ... doesn't necessarily pitch to the to the ... was going to be a battle you know fatter and fatter sorry veteran Fisher feature bad Everytime you go up there and these guys are faced him quite a bit of time but obviously you know there's nothing really you can do to prepare for guy like her car shopping done when he's done over the course of his career\nIs a lot of let these you are going to take them out for the Dodgers what sort of challenges does that present in terms of you know practical lie to\nYou know for so far I think I'm a count has done a really good job of just letting guys know that they may play in this situation they may not play in that situation but outline of hasn't had too many changes\nYou know for the most part no matter who the starter has been for the last couple of weeks the life has been pretty consistent except for some of the middle and feel there's there but I think you know the fact that you have the ability to mix and match up there like to do with our senior Sharm\nStop us or scope you out there and I give it a lot of uh\nOptions for council go out there and say okay well we'll try this one we can do that one but I still feel just as confident\nCurtis I'm sure the days off it felt night you're the body gift to regenerate a little bit but you also want to Lebanon in a row so how do you make sure that none of the most votes why they're able to face are\nPros and cons of having days off everybody obviously looks to get healed up you know God has bumps and bruises nine hundred and sixty two plus the postseason you look forward to getting a chance to give some rough at the same time with baseball uh you don't necessarily get consistent days off except for the all star break so playing on a day to day basis\nOr something that you definitely want to do a good thing both us and the Dodgers are very similar situation they've only had one less they often us so we're both in a very similar situation trying to stay ... remain hot come off the gates hot you know so it's going to be a ballot who can actually execute it do it and continue to keep their hot streak growth\nField advantage is healthy they think it is that here up until the world series [noise]\nAh it's interesting because regardless of the really when it comes down to you know if you have to do a game seven I think you\nThe first couple of games are going to be dependent on\nObviously you have no choice you of the mill apart fan they're going to be cheering for us in in trying our best to try their best to take jobs out of it but if you end up winning or end up losing games and don't make it to a game seven home field advantage really doesn't make any difference on where the other so often depend on how you know the first came go here at the next day the game's going Dodger Stadium and if we have to come back here to another part\nIt's Curtis credited from earlier today in Wisconsin's afternoon news will wrap up rivers tonight after this

I can say is that what you see a museum great maps it wrapping things up Robert Miller park where the brewers have\nDodgers game one of the ... you know get to the end of this series that you have this massive tonight the brewers vote that has been absolutely remarkable really all these laws but what was the last twenty nine games how about this a record of Fifteen or do you know the real one sixty seven\nThat's over a hundred twenty nine and two thirds getting hit just twenty four or roads in opponents are better just won the eighty five\nAgainst the brewers ... pen that has all but it's that is absolutely dominated if you consider that okay you you had a little bit of the tigers in there and not everybody was in the playoffs on but that also includes a widower Chicago and gave one sixty three the entire series against the Rockies that's a pretty high leverage baseball being played down the threat that's included\nIn that series including a are those that I should say including a series at St Louis so\nThat's the good news here for the Milwaukee Brewers what is the bad news wasn't really isn't that the team was what eleven and a rope\nDid not lead perfect series against the Rockies but they didn't sweet the Rockies with pitching serving as the ... some tightly hitting especially in game three you saw it I just play games water into runners at scoring position maybe it is not what you'd want to see overall was pitching could do what it did against Los Angeles\nYou should be a happy brewers fan in about a week and a half or so now as for the Dodgers they have\nThree left he's scheduled to start against the brewers in this series and they also have a right hander add water dealer who was arguably the best started for the Dodgers this entire season so it starts

I think maybe you and I are on the side of the job market things lots of the cops\nOut well I guess he just wrapped it together really well because if they thought that you just said the reason that they didn't do it because they thought to protest to be too much to handle that that seems like the exact opposite if anything if anything they think that while there's the protests that people really don't like that and that's the reason why we should\nCall it the way out now I don't mind that was that\nI disagree with that mark and slot for the call but I disagree with that that you're going to cancel something because some people don't like\nBoy I cannot disagree with that more\nBecause that is the essence of free speech\nThat some people do in fact and remember the school board is a government\nSo you can argue that are limiting free speech here\nBased on concerns of some in the population are we still have a lot of people don't want to talk on this we will stay on this\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty on accident mortgage talking tax line nine forty two news radio WGM Jay lovers are sent to host the national league championship series at Miller Park is this a bass first team in the history of the franchise\nSteve scruffy the ways in from where else ... one of those southern this afternoon it's hard topic to say the least for one for seven nine\nNine to one since ... the academic mortgage talk intact flying I think we had an excellent variety of calls on every angle on this issue shore with a high canceling scheduled productions of to kill a mocking bird\nBecause they got word on social media of protests over the use of the N word\nThey had options they could have just tried to have a conversation with the community and say look we if if you're offended\nUnderstand this is why we think is important and they did on their website but apparently didn't get the word out enough to accurately and honestly complete the narrative the N. word will be use I think that is absolutely fair\nThey could have taken the word out they didn't feel that that would be right to do that\nThey could have just you know the heck was that we're going to we're going to do this and we'll be able to protest they could have taken the word out I disagree with that are cancelled my really don't I I certainly don't agree with that\nI don't do they fear violent protests and and if so why\nTwo days in a war with suicide David Hi you're on the um J.\nVery good morning I'm I'm Glad I don't ...

I Believe that they should not have canceled for play and my take on it is is is that when heartburn he wrote the book was written as\nWho's written meant to be a time sort of and to draw attention to the extreme bigotry and prejudice of the time so when people want to protest the ... the during you know certainly voter but there are offended and we should of that that's why she rolls\nAnd force in advancing the civil rights movement and is now seen as at least an element of it is seen as offensive to the African American community\nThat's exactly my point\nYeah and it's a great one who's saying one of them said\nDon thanks a lot for the call and and and that gets ... that you were that gets lost though is you\nHave to put it in historical context\nWhat we're saying on this I tell you what we're going to take calls probably up to the news and I've got a bunch of tax I I got there was really good tax I've got to share them I'll probably end up doing that\nOr after ten o'clock and it's a hot topic and they're just an absolute excellent thoughts um even if I don't agree with all of them I think people are making some excellent points and that's what it should be all about the accident mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine months twenty nine sixty\nOne news radio WGM Jay nine fifty for news radio WGM Jay with\nThe hot hot topic we have I forgot to ah keep you up to date on bounced back friday on Wall street the dial up to Ninety six points Seventy eight talking about the decision by the shore with a high school to cancel a production of to kill a mocking bird threatened protests over the use of the N word\nTo Amy in West Alice Amy higher in GM Jay\nOkay so I think the adults can or can't put a lot of kind of energy in Akron I think the coming up with this production there was a group that money ... why didn't go for that kind of why we cover laugh I don't think that with fair to anybody\nI don't have an answer to that what I Would say is the districts are saying they didn't do a good enough job of getting it out into the community I'm speculating I don't have the answer and they were happy they just recently found\nThat ... know slim maybe maybe they just\nLike I'm not saying that they were I guess we're going\nTo be around school ... and I think it was a throng of anybody to think that's protesting at ... like that\nSame he thinks a lot for the call appreciate it from Amy Amy this one in Racine go ahead Amy\nSorry Jerry into walking my ... uh no wait a minute who we got\nGo ahead Amy sorry about that boy and struggling with the phones today go ahead\n[noise] [noise] well I was thinking I don't think it was profit but I'm tired cancel at I think in certain ... certain garbage in order to provoke the emotion that they're going par for the other times\nUm if they're gonna do separate murder I'm over here a play about bad\nThink what they're looking for insurance on the rich get richer than\nI Do in fact it's a really disappointed because and let me let me put some words in your mouth is is what you're saying we have an issue if you're going to be offended by us trying to show you the way things used to be\nCorrect yes yes and you want to get out of a theater is about it's provoking hours on end and the third conversation you change that verbiage in order to get that emotion and and the idea of the time it wouldn't it wouldn't be effective\nAmy thanks a lot for the call I it it's the same thing is when a movie studios are told don't have people smoking cigarettes in period pieces that when a lot of people smoke cigarettes it just really doesn't ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "12"}
