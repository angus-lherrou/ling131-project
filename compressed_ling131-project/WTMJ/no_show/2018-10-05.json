J. good afternoon\nI compared to the over right there on the show you have to you know you have to really think that it's time for people to move on if you're in eighty or Ninety okay voyage differently and they have to do that there are available but\nWhen you're a line to get really don't want to keep going to work I mean if you hang up\nAnd ... yeah well\nIt it well it it is in any even be looking you hate to say that because their their second and third and fourth accident American Life and there's all sorts of stuff that you do but\nLike I said that the best example there's a reason why American businesses have mandatory retirement age is I mean there there is so if it's good enough for the the biggest companies in the world why isn't that good enough for I don't know the U.S Senate or Congress it should be\nBasically Mike appreciated in Milwaukee camera WGM J. lo\nO\nNow your allies and I'm going to go back and I'm going to look at my emails and my text messages and when they have all sorts of people accusing me of being an age is so and so and I'm really not I'm just trying to call them like I see him and this one\nNo you're right I Am but I think I think that it can um we are I think a lot of people that have their Morrow all the way you know God Bless them\nWhen you're pushing that I didn't have a name and pushing and if they are going to war and ... and you're you know and that somebody else pick up the paper\nWas that the the other thing I mean and I mean I understand for example being a U.S senator has an incredible amount of power and stuff like that and I get that there's a a lure of power but at some point in time and and I don't know when you hit it could make it whether it's sixty five or Seventy or Seventy five or certainly by the time you start hitting eighty\nMaybe it isn't there other stuff in a life than go traveling back and forth between your home district in Washington DC I takes a lot for the call and I appreciate just\nLet me just food for thought look you need we have a minimum age requirements and I I\nLook I get into this discussion from time to time I've been doing this job long enough that I I'm One of these people who for example argues that\nWe should have additional testing of older drivers and then you probably heard me go on my my rant about this\nI'm simply because again was the fact is I don't see as well today if I did twenty five years ago I I don't and my guess is unfortunate enough to be here twenty five years from now I'm not going to the U.S will ban as I Do now\nThat these in Wisconsin the way it works is you can renew your driver's license and and you can go if you don't have an accident or a collision you can actually go eight years without having you know any sort of checks at all and I just think that's crazy because\nAgain the effects of of aging and I'm never I Would never argue that somebody should not be entitled simply because of an age to drive a car\nBut I Do think it's reasonable for example to say OK once you hit a certain age we're going to have added testing maybe some maybe some on the road things maybe instead of being able to renew your license you know for eight years without being checked maybe and make it two years I think those are reasonable sorts of things and\nAnd I think we need to move to them unfortunately there's no political will for it let's take a break it's one twenty six year factor WTO O. J. broadcasting live from Miller Park\nIs one thirty this year ... U. T. M. J. WGM radio presents hometown\nCall eternal all it is a viewing party for game one this afternoon it it's a free of here's what we're going to do massive movie screen broadcast it to turn our whole ballroom per whole course right across the street from the Bradley Center game one of the national league division series between the brewers and the Rockies and here's the cool thing it is going to be sinks\nHall of famer Bob ... play by play broadcast on totally T. M. J. radio and the associated bank brewers radio network doors open at three o'clock this afternoon first pitches it for so if you're not in a position to be able to come out to Miller Park and enjoy the game in person you can check it out at Turner hall All right\nOne of the things that's become an issue in the governor's race is the condition of the roads in this state\nDespite the fact that I I think Governor Walker has put millions of dollars into road building in road grows you you got it really gets frustrated by the state of the infrastructure and in many respects trying to build and improve roads is just a bottomless pit because\nGiven everything that goes on and the weather the roads are always a need to prepare and you want to have growth and all those sort of things plus you have the department of transportation the for the last\nSeveral decades really I don't believe has been responsible to the taxpayers we talked about this before [laughter] Journal Sentinel had the story about how ... ... there's this project involving the market interchange where are the zoo interchange where\nThey were double built state was double bill like four hundred thousand dollars for gravel was delivered blunt load of gravel four hundred grand\nAnd and they were ... they were charged twice for it and and people caught they caught it and administrators department of transportation decided to look the other way now we're not going to try to get the money back and say the the road builders groups a consortium that had the deal they\nThey've behaving in a way that well they should have been wearing masks carrying guns they refuse to give the money back that's unfortunately part of the thing that goes on in Wisconsin where you have\nJust a a lot of just uncaring people when it comes to health taxpayer money is spent but anyway there was a story a little while ago that were out of state\nAnd maybe out of country investors who wanted to come in and we're offering to privatize the roadway the journal sentinel has a little bit more of this and it's kind of interesting here's the way they report it\nCanadian and British investors\nTold Wisconsin transportation officials last year that they had over a billion dollars available to fund highways in Milwaukee and around the United states\nApparently what happened is they they they reached out to to Governor Walker's administration\nAnd it got kicked over to the state transportation secretary and apparently you know he he took a meeting you know or at least explored this a little bit in November\nSome guy from one of these outfits told state officials that he was interested in investing in Milwaukee highways and had about one point four billion dollars available\nFor the the projects now they didn't explain explicitly how this would work but typically what happens in these arrangements is that\nYou have this private company did come in and they agreed to either build or maintain the roads you don't have to worry you don't have to worry we'll take care of this but\nThey said we're going to end the roads and these wells or we will we're going to typically putting tolls but it it's going to be privatized for the roads now that's something which we don't typically do around here and Governor Walker's administration said we're we're not interested\nBut of course let's take a step back here you have\nThese foreign investors who say look we're willing to come in here you're complaining about the roads\nYou're saying you don't have enough money to fix the roads tell you what we'll do it we'll maintain them and then we'll charge people to use it why bother now we've privatized other things and in some cases it works in other cases it doesn't work\nBut these companies now again the Walker administration said not interested in this at all you know kind of shut it down\nI understand why they did it this isn't to be critical of him but given where we are and given the fact that you know I I Can't talk about the governor's race without savvy to people call in and complain about roads what do you think about this idea should we explore\nPrivatization the idea that responsibility for certain roadways will take it\nAbout this idea should we explore\nPrivatization the idea that responsibility for certain roadways will take it from the state will take it from the county will take it away from the city whatever and we'll let a private company do it understanding that the private company is going to charge people to do it\nIs is a solution to our road problem for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that's accurate mortgage talking text line\nUnion organizers who are paid to go out and show off well yesterday it showed up at a McDonald's north avenue the owner and McDonald's hit close so there there wasn't anything to see so what the group did then there's an effort to get attention is instead of protesting the Donald's\nThey decided to walk into the intersection sit down and then essentially forced the police to arrest them so they ended up getting themselves on TV yeah they ended up getting themselves on television okay you've accomplished that\nBut if you brought anybody or to your caused by deciding gee you know we're going to move the protests that were going to try to disrupt things my argument would be well okay maybe these are the cases where TB should just stop giving these protesters what they want\nIt to none news story they are encouraging again the lawlessness by putting them on TV you just ignore 'em and maybe they're going to go away something you can't ignore the Milwaukee Brewers in two thousand Eighteen we're gonna be talking about that and just a couple of minutes stick around as one fifty nine this is Jeff wicker double duty I'm Jay [noise]\n\nIssues\nCivil use him Jay ... is the sun is shining a little bit cool out here it is hard fans are streaming in right now we are position right out in front of Miller Park way by the circular drop off for all the different shuttle buses come in from the different bars and restaurants in town it shouldn't just flashed\nWatch all this going on um people are getting ready for his pitch two hours from now a lot of people out\nHere people tailgating people having a lot of fun I'm going to be with you for another hour today were turned over to ... and then he'll take into brewers baseball the game is sold out forty five thousand plus people the brewers are cautioning everybody\nIf you're coming out to the game they're encouraging people to get to their seats Hurley I Know they've got some special pre game activities that are going on\nBut also you you've got security lines semi think opening day and actually the weather can recommend it sort of opening day when it's been dry All right but I I Want to kind of segue now into a conversation about baseball and the play offs and\nHow cool this is we've got a couple of topics related to that\nFirst of all one of the things that I was saying earlier for the people who are selling tickets in the secondary market\nAll the the bottom is kind of fallen out of that because if the cubs were coming up here you know that there would be incredible demand from the Chicago fans while those for virtue of the fact the cubs\nLast Denise I never get tired of saying that by virtue of the fact that the cubs last the other night what happens is now you've got the Colorado Rockies and I'm sure there'll be some Rockies fans here but it's not like people you know drive in Ninety miles from Chicago Ninety minutes up from Chicago\nSo you're you're going to have I think many many many many many brewers fancier clearly you're not going to have that thing but you have some time from the you know it is it you know Miller Park is it like Ridley park north or whatever Wrigley Field north\nBut it it's going to be fun now this is the first year that my buddy and I\nWe we broke down and I told the story before we we we bought it for twenty pack of season tickets and I I Will tell you that the twenty pack season ticket I thoroughly enjoyed it so I went to I used almost all those games and then got a games from T. M. J. or whatever so I think I've probably been to about twenty five games or or thirty games maybe this year\nAnd if you're going to make a purchase this was the year to do it next year will be the year to do it as well\nBecause it's fun to go into the games in person I have a lot of fun now there is true it's true that when you go to a game you give up some stuff you give up the convenience of being able to listen to the game at home or watch the game on TV\nYou give up the convenience of being able to walk ten steps in your in your bathroom\nYou give up the convenience of being able to walk into the kitchen and grab a beer but what you do is you get the shared communal experience and you and thirty thousand or thirty five thousand or like today forty five thousand or your best friends all hanging out together cheering on your team\nI got into this conversation with somebody the other day though 'cause they said are you going to the games and you have it be broadcasting from outside the games and then you got the tickets I'm I'm going to go and then I'm going to be enjoying the game\nAnd they were telling me well you know that sounds like it might be okay but I just kind of like to stay home and and watch the games on on TV or listen to the games on the radio and I said really I mean if you had a chance if you had the opportunity to go to the game you'd rather stay home\nAnd the guy was talking to said yeah that that's kind of it and I admit I don't get it All right for one for\nSeven nine nine one six when he does he ... mortgage talking and text line does it matter to you\nIf you were there if you have a chance to go to that we're talking about the brewers playoff games but if you have a chance to go to a sporting event live particularly a sporting event like this something that you know we haven't had a home playoff game in seven years [noise]\nWould you rather be they're alive or just being there live not matter is it died she I I can listen to the game on the radio I can put it on TV [laughter] yeah it's it's not quite the same but you know I don't have to pay as much for the beer I don't have to wait for the hotdogs I don't have to stand in line for the restroom for one for seven nine nine when six twenty\n... mortgage talking and text line\nIs it important for you to be there in person for what for seven nine nine which ... we just got to the minute to poor teacher record WGM drag [noise]\nRelationship with her WGM may go to Facebook got commerce ... W champion Facebook page just took the picture\nThe trees all standing outside the mobile all broadcast facility me in the background I tell you it does not get any better than that\nRight a guy was arguing with me the other day saying well I understand why you might like to go to the ball game but I just stay at home listen to the game on the radio watched on TV I don't get it but start with Derrick andme anomaly falls Hi Derek\nOh thank you for taking my call\nIce her saying\nI agree with you wholeheartedly that are more\nWell known it every year\nAnd if I don't want to do it again I would've done it\nWorked in a way if I said we don't get to I don't want to do that you had to take advantage\nOf you know it it it may very well be I mean you always that the team's going to get back in next year's team is going to be better or whatever but the truth is\nIt's been seven years since the brewers were in the play offs\nAnd the brewers haven't been to the world series and I want to put the cart ahead of the horse they haven't been in the world series since Nineteen eighty two so when you get these kind of opportunities I I think if you get a chance you got to take advantage of them and you got to show out a show up and there's nothing like being at someplace in person there's just not\nCorrect that makes it hard preacher for one for seven nine nine one six twenty John ... good afternoon\nMan jobs and like all the things that are in the last may and my brother was alive and then also and it it it it got it for it it's not that famous all your regular game that they\nWanted their own by all means you know you know you you you might as well go if it's worth\n... well it is because you're you're making memories no thanks for the call John I mean I Would say I vividly remember one of the things that I'm really kind of hung up on is it doesn't seem like seven years ago I mean I remember being here for the last time they were in division series\nPlaying the Arizona Diamondbacks and and you might remember they they it was a five game series they ended up winning that was a team that had Paul Paul modern out that was the team that had Ryan Braun and Prince Fielder and Niger Morgan and they ended up winning game five in the tenth inning with just spectacular sort of play\nAnd I can remember walking out of of Miller Park and the place which has been rocking\nEverybody's coming out everybody celebrate it seems like it was just yesterday but it was seven years ago and and yes I Know if I'd been watching it at home I Would have been celebrating I Would have been incredibly happy but it it just\nFlat out was in the same and it it's a memory is being there I I Know I'm dating myself but I Am\nOne of my most spectacular brewers memories as I remember it eighty to the American league championship series brewers head to win three in a row at the old county stadium I remember those games particularly that Sunday and everybody's seen the replays where you know the ... the shortstop it in the game\nThat I was there how cool is that\nAmes particularly that Sunday and everybody's seen the replays where you know the ground ball the shortstop it in the game that I was there how cool is that Sherry and Milwaukee Sherry or T. M. J. good afternoon\nMy mom does ma'am\nI'm we won't be going to the game and I can comment on my phone number ...\nMetro\nJerry Lewis ship it's okay if he or she was\nShe was yeah um we got Sherry Sherry's phone kind of dropped out there it was one of those situations where he would she said she was going to be going tomorrow night I\nGet to look and I understand that everybody has the opportunity to go and the tickets are expensive and the tickets are hard to come by and all that stuff and and and I get it\nAnd I certainly would not suggest you for example that\nYou know you if you can't get into the game that means you don't listen to it or whatever you want to be a fan and you want to participate I'm just saying that if you get the opportunity to take advantage of it because there's nothing like being at a game live period right to twenty two Jeff WGM shape back with more just a minute\nLooks like he's going to score and all of a sudden he does a face plant falls down gets thrown out at home plate\nThose are the things that kind of tell you maybe you've got a team of destiny okay here's the deal we're we're kind of up against the clock here only have about ten minutes or so\nWe've been talking baseball we were talking about all sorts of other stuff the brewers are getting ready to start the playoffs I understand that I look at things maybe through a fans' eyes but I have to tell you objectively\nI think the brewers are as good as any team in the national league may be as good as any team in baseball I think they are going to the world series\nHow far is this team going to go for one for seven nine nine one six twenty as he accurate mortgage talk ...\nThis is our last chance to discuss playoff predictions before the playoffs actually start brewers are at home they got the home field advantage throughout all the national league playoffs if they win the series\nThey will be at home against either Los Angeles or Atlanta games getting ready to kick off the brewers have been no kickoffs sorry ... mix my metaphors the brewers have announced\nYou know their their playoff roster how good is this team for one for seven nine nine what six twenty medically accurate mortgage pocket and text line just like any team they need things to go right but I'll tell you as somebody who's watched sports for decades and decades and decades\nSometimes you see these teams and so I was the players\nBut first of all are the he's healthy and the brewers in general are healthy right now secondly there's teams that just seemed to get breaks it becomes your year it's the guy that falls in does the face plant instead of scoring the winning run for the ball that should have been caught it goes over the fence\nFor one for seven nine nine one six play let's start with Paul and Colgate Paul you're on WGM Jacob afternoon\nOn what do you think how far does this team go\nDo this and the Braves aware and and the Braves will come on here we're\nOnly get one with the Braves over the brewers tell me why\nThey're whatever they could very\nWell it makes a call I mean I guess you know that would be an interesting thing you know the the team when the Braves were in Milwaukee they won the world series I guess that would be sort of an interesting type of thing for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I'm Sorry I just think\nI think the brewers are better team I don't I don't I got to confess\nI don't follow the American league that well I I pay a lot of tension the national league don't follow the American league except inevitably you know if you watch ESPN you can't help yourself because it's gonna be a Boston Red Sox from New York Yankees but I'm telling you I think the brewers compare well with them can in Milwaukee Kenya and double duty I'm Jay\nI'm going\nI'm doing well how far to the brewers go\nBaseball back in Milwaukee Brewers will go to the area\nAnd they're going to go in bars are hitting is going to take I'm hedging about Sandy ... great chapter nurturing like they got to be able to get those wires and I'm Sorry they're showing\nThat we are now um I don't think that all the money from the correct on why don't you write that great\nYeah I mean actually I used to call that you know that was ... and and listen to these games at home and my my wife will testify to this I'm I'm kinda scream out you've got a guy on third\nBase with no outs you got to be able to get them in but I Will tell you the last month or so they've been doing that you know they've been cashing in on those opportunities and you're right you have to be able to do that and you need some breaks\nIt's always going to be interesting to see also who are the players that are going to merge it seems like\nIt's always somebody that comes out of the clear blue somebody even think of them give you an example\nJust the other day the game against ah the cubs on Monday okay Orlando Garcia who gets who's a great shortstop it gets into the minor leagues because he was hit the less than two hundred you know it comes back he goes for for for ... arguably the biggest game of the season how cool is that\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty All right Glen in Glendale you're on WGM Jay hello\n[laughter] come on and now you know what I'm going to go and what do you think how far to the brewers go\nActually here are very iffy that I think the brewers are going to go all the way they're going to win the world series they got the pitch can't a sequence and and the system down\nThey've got to get him down or they got a player a somewhat like they had or what the objects and yelling and all the rest of them backing them up and I are fairly thank you very very scary yeah this\nIs Harry Harry Jacqueline I and I know you have been a long suffering brewers fan for decades right or wrong right\n[laughter] well I tell you thanks for calling out from your lips to God's Ears ... absolutely you look at this\nAnd I mean that's one of the great things about this brewers lined up to I mean you know there's I mean you go you know one through six you're talking about world class hitters for land or sea is hitting it's great no doubts thanks for the call up the way\nThey used to call I appreciate it for one for seven nine nine one six twenty All right Mike in Chicago Mike you're on WGM J. lo\nO Cosby Show Monday at times you know I'm not a cubs fan I'm a diehard shame but I think walking while you or I think they showed a lot of a lot of personal very the effort in game the other night coming from LA and I think they're going to try to learn were those were sitting around for a couple\nOf days I guess much leader I think Colorado split cheer sports law goes for the ones total in Colorado and one in four I think it got enough right and the power and their line up\nOff the road so pitching staff and I of course he he's a great player who watch the ... the ...\nI think he feels the show in Colorado and just before ...\nWell I I I might call I appreciate you listening and I appreciate opposite perspectives and I also appreciate I Know you called the show before and like you say you are a Packers fan and bears country so you've got a special place in my heart but in this particular one I think you're all wet but you but I get I I Will say that I mean the\nI think today and tomorrow are important games for the brewers\nSimply because the the better Colorado pitchers are going to be lined up\nOver the weekend I'm so and again anything can happen but I I think it's the brewers could get these two games and it would be to install it today and tomorrow we'll be in ... credibly important get would be a great jumpstart now I understand the kind of an obvious thing to say well gee you saying that you know when the first two games\nYou know in a five game series we've got to win the best three out of five isn't it okay but what I'm saying is I think Colorado they're better pitchers taking nothing away from the people that are pitching today and tomorrow they're better pitchers are gonna be lined up to pitch it home so that's I think one of the concerns in the issues that you have\nChanged in my nominee fall Shane euro WGM Jay good afternoon\nI was going on or are they sure are pursuing your as long as they keep the ... the way it is I don't shoot him back and they and their pitcher extra they got to put yourself in the third\nGuy from a hundred all parents are just knock on orders when it comes to the pictures I mean look you got here that's been there for a strike last everywhere never off my reward for a while but it's warrior hundreds of hours or what if you refer ... worker\nAgain I'm I'm I'm with you I mean ... I Will say this I mean if you look at the qualities and simple brewers have in the bullpen ... if they get a leader early and you know\nSo I mean if you look at the quality and simple and brewers have in that bullpen ... if they get a leader early and you know their their head after five or six innings I mean is there a better bullpen and the league to hold is going to be interesting to me today that today's what they're calling one of the bullpen games they've got Brandon would rip who was a starter\nThen they had him in the bullpen he's going to pitch a couple innings and I think they're they're going to go to different alternatives but it's a lot of fun\nWelcome to the WGM Jay dot coms live streaming feature right now WGM Jay is broadcasting play by play sports or syndicator programming we do not have the rights to stream these broadcasts please check our website for the program scheduling upcoming games\nAnd of course you can hear live play by play an syndication by using a radio and turning to six twenty Eliot GM jak\n[noise]\nWealth than the ... we are broadcasting from the WGM Jay ... city oh outside of Miller Park it is game one of the national league division series playoffs first pitch\nA little bit after four o'clock this afternoon here's the way it is going to work for the parking lot and I said just a minute ago and it's true it's like the home for the storm what's going on now is the parking lot is centrally empty\nEssentially empty they're going to open up in a bounce I'm\nWell about one o'clock sometimes the brewers make the decision to open up a little bit earlier\nBut the parking lots are going to open up three hours or so before the first pitch\nThe stadium itself opens up about two and a half hours before the first pitch but right now it's kind of this\nEerie sense of anticipation you see some people that are milling around the Milwaukee police were here with their drug sniffing or bomb sniffing dog or whatever walking around but everybody is getting ready some of the workers were coming in to get the stadium staff\nIs that what the Senate should do when it votes on the nomination and it will vote on the nomination tomorrow and Saturday for one for seven nine when six twenty if you're on the line please hold on we'll discuss in just a moment\nWe're broadcasting live from Miller Park in advance of game one at the national league division series it's twelve twenty four this is Jeff record double duty M.

I Believe that it's fundamentally an ethical for a prosecutor to bring criminal charges in the case that they know or should know that they have absolutely no chance of being able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and that is clearly the case\nOr electrical fast fast alert if a child claims that priest molested them thirty five years of gold should they be held accountable and currently charge\nTo any ...\nWell not in the corporate not what the answer is is it depends if you have an unverified and completely uncorroborated ... an allegation from thirty five years ago\nThere's nobody that's going to bring charges based simply on that now it might be that you're able to find some cooperation might be that you're able to find a pattern and practice and other people who made those allegations of but but just\nSaying we're going to charge somebody for something that they allegedly did thirty five years ago would again there is no cooperation ... it's it's just flat and now it's flat not going to happen and\nI I guess my next to the point I've been making all along about these investigations that if you're you're never going to have more evidence and you have you have the lady who makes the allegation\nAnd I can't remember this I Can't remember that and again people can argue about whether that is legitimate or whether it affects her credibility I don't even want to get to that point in time I just wanted to say that the mere allegation itself\nIs all you were ever going to have\nBecause of the passage of time or or whatever\nSo this idea that well simply because he's been accused of something and there's no corroboration at all\nThat should be disqualifying that's a really really dangerous place to be in America if that's where we are now where somebody can come up and say ... any of us did something thirty five or forty years ago it was never reported\nThere is no sort of cooperation but this now means that you shouldn't be able to do this job or that job or whatever we're going to pick it up right there if you're on the line please hold on for one for seven nine nine one six twenty Cory Booker senator from New Jersey says it doesn't matter where the capital is guilty or innocent\nHe shouldn't be on the Supreme Court what do you think\nThey're each other just whether shovels U.

J. was broadcasting live from outside of Miller Park six twenty ... mobile\nStudio it appears\nThat they're just in the process of opening up the parking lots of leaks the main parking lot\nThe preferred parking lot right in front of our\nBroadcast facility here they're starting to let cars in and people are unpacking their vehicles and they're setting up tables and they're getting ready for their tailgate if you are coming out to Miller Park again uh the the gates are going to open up um generally speaking sometime around one thirty I think the state to get into the stadium\nAnd what's the brewers are saying is\nHave fun and you're tailgating but they're going to be security line just going to kind of be like opening day there's going to be forty five thousand people here so they're encouraging people to make sure you get in getting your seat Shirley my understanding is they got some special stuff lined up this pre game activities\nSo don't miss the first pitch of this game for one for seven nine nine one six twenty if you're just joining us\nThe FBI report is now complete\nAs I said when we were having this conversation over the last several weeks just as a practical matter I don't know what the FBI investigation was going to reveal because the the allegations against judge Kavanaugh are older and they're unconfirmed mobile because of the passage of time\nUm the lack of recollection of some of the accusers so this is the fact that they've turned up nothing is is no surprise at all but there's still a number of prominent Democrats are saying it doesn't matter whether turned up or not he should still be voted down but shock to Suzanne in Greenville Suzanne or there'll be tamped Jay good afternoon\nThank you for taking my call and I wind is now I think that a lot of flak about not only is your story I'm cooperated\nMinister from being afraid of flying in and and I know that you find all over the world and then her story by that right now claim that were there\n... and not only not cooperated refuted ... story in the door to door she got to find in the house what turns out her next meal that nine out of your house and she didn't get to enjoy the charm\nAnd I find out in your house and she didn't get to enjoy the charm and then also that lie about how they craft not knowing if you're being he owned by her lawyers and highly graph I mean your lawyer would have happened you know I'm a\nLawyer and certainly inconsistency hit me that there's there's clearly inconsistencies I guess but what about the whereabouts of more fundamental things that the allegations in them all ended up themselves compare and you look at that plus the way he\nReacted he he was angry et cetera et cetera it is that enough or should that be enough to disqualify him from Supreme Court\nWell you know Andrei ... Chelsea the time and sharing everyone now if you're going if it if I'm like well that Miller I don't know you don't have the evidence to find\nYou can't you can't go to court or you can file a claim and on and say that while you're at my age and you have some kind of evidence playing if you will see that for instance claimants and you're not that mean they could actually do you practice here and there and found out what really in the plans\nFor slander against or if he wanted\nTo do that but you can't just fine Sal and he had a lot it again I might get an allegation you have some kind of evidence of that claim like right on that you know read about how can share with not only the allegation is your\nStory and cases and there's a lot of out of it actually made you know\nA lot of the call I mean I understand that I I Want to look I have already said if I was in the U.S Senate I Would vote for judge Kevin I Would vote for him I think he\nHas the qualifications to be a Supreme Court judge and I don't think that you should be saying no to people\nBased on uncorroborated serious allegations of misconduct and unpredictable and I'm uncorroborated allegations of misconduct I don't think that's fair to the process I don't think that's fair to anybody who's going to be a nominee now having said that though it were were not in a court of law where we're not in\nInnocence until proven guilty our first caller was saying well I think they should you should criminal charges against him well\nSo to respect that's ridiculous I mean nobody's\nNo prosecutor is going to\nBring a criminal charge based on an unsupported uncorroborated and unproven all allegations from thirty six years ago but at the same time we aren't talking about innocence until proven guilty is not a criminal setting it's not a civil setting it's a sin at the U.S Senate in the context of\nAdvising and consenting to you know a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court so it is a different standard for one for seven nine one six twenty seal in mosquito Phil thanks for waiting on WGM drag\nThis is one where you know maybe MSNBC really kind of cross the line because you know the difference here is\nThe these allegations are explosive there is no cooperation and if you do multiple interviews this woman seems to back off and all of these I really I think as I said earlier the Supreme Court nomination process has been forever change and not for the better and I think again\nThe way the media particularly the mainstream media handles allegations\nAnd what they choose to present when there's no corroborating evidence\nI think it's changing the media standards as well and like I Would say that's not for the better as well we got a lot of great stuff coming up on today's program we'll be back with more just a couple of minutes like I say we're broadcasting live from outside Miller Park the six twenty there'll be team the mobile studio it's twelve fifty seven to ... [noise]\nIf one can decision whether WGM Jay and I AM broadcasting live from the ... the chief mobile studio\nOur mobile broadcast facility house in front of Miller Park got a chance to wander around a little bit over the last couple of minutes the\nParking lots are open for grills or going people are in the mood for baseball stadium opens up I Believe in about a half hour or so out of the brewers are suggesting that people get in their seats Hurley there are security\nLines and things that I Know they've got a lot of special pre game activities first pitch a little bit after four o'clock this afternoon so I'm telling you it is exciting great\nEnvironment out here if you cannot get out to Miller Park if you don't have tickets the game is in fact sold out would remind everybody that we've got our W. A. T. M. J. hometown call eternal hole the watch party at the ballroom maternal hall which is in the second floor we're going to have a giant screen TV sets\nAnd what's really cool as we are sinking up that TV a broadcast to our W T. M. J. play by play so you can hear ... bringing Bob euchre making the calls that's very cool Turner hall the gates the doors open up at three o'clock at a get first pitch\nSlightly after four o'clock so check that out\nOn this program we're we're sort of shake weighing in towards baseball to spend a lot of time talking about the play offs and baseball and the two o'clock hour the program but some other stuff going on in the world and some interesting topics I Want to discuss with your\nLast week when I was watching the the Senate Judiciary committee hearings on on Brett Kavanaugh ... I Will say one of the things that struck me was\nHow many of the senators were\nIt it and if if that was the impression that you got well it it's correct\nCharles Grassley for example um who was that the committee chair person Grassley he's eighty five years old Orrin Hatch eighty four years old Patrick Leahy Seventy eight years old Dianne Feinstein you know the list goes on and on and on you know in the case of\nLay he and Orrin Hatch and Charles Grassley\nThey had experience with confirmation hearings flight crew one that happened last week 'cause they handled the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One and here you know what twenty plus years later they're still handling these types of things now I thought this was interesting because in most not all\nBut most publicly held corporations in this country there is there's an age limit\n'em for example many many many many many companies have a policy that says once a a CEO hits a certain age well then they kind of kick him upstairs put them on the board of directors making chairman emeritus or whatever but they make room for a younger person\nGenerally speaking you did it privately held companies\nThere is often a transition process project process that takes place where you know you make way for a younger generation because I mean look I understand with with age comes wisdom but at a certain point\nEverybody starts to slow down\nAnd that's why you know many like I say many companies make way for younger people in politics it doesn't work that way in politics you have\nElected officials who get into office in some cases people move on but in many cases that they cling to it forever and that's why you have senators that are in their eighties in some cases you've had senators who are in there even longer than that\nAnd look I I understand that we all age differently but the truth of the matter is already there are certain effects to to aging and in many situations I don't know there's a reason why people decide to retire and that's because they don't have as much energy\nSay it's Seventy it's they did at forty I'm cognitive processes start to decrease a little bit those are all the different factors that are out there but we don't have a maximum age limit when it comes to political office we have a minimum age limit\nHey you have to be thirty five years old to be the president the United states but we don't have a maximum age limit\nAlright for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the ac unit mortgage talk ... what do you think about that\nI wouldn't make sense to say that beyond a certain point and and again I understand that people age differently no question about it but beyond a certain point\nMaybe should there be sexually a mandatory retirement age you're not talking about term limits I'm just talking about and I don't know what that time term I don't know what that age would be would it be Seventy would it be Seventy five would it be eighty but beyond that\nShouldn't we say All right once you hit that age it's time it is time to make way for somebody younger\nFor one for seven nine one six twenty to the accurate mortgage talk and text line it's an issue that we don't like to address in society today because the reality is we are all getting older and that's certainly beats the alternative\nBut you know when you do look at for example the Senate Judiciary committee last week you see a lot of people who\nHave a ton of experience no question about it but they're also\nOlder would it make more sense with the\nWho have a ton of experience no question about it but they're also older would it make more sense with the country the better off would we have a better system if we said at a certain point in time\nJust like lots of private corporations do we're going to have a mandatory retirement age for one for seven nine nine what six twenty to check it at mortgage architects flights I Will tell you where I come down on this and we'll discuss in just a moment\nMandatory retirement age is for politicians would it make sense we discuss next if you're on the line please hold on we're broadcasting live from outside of Miller Park it's the playoffs kick off and just a couple of hours it's\nOne sixty this Jeff record WGM Jay\nWhen I teach a class or WTO once again broadcasting live from Miller Park I was on some numbers during the break it kind of interesting\nUm I guess it's two thousand Seventeen report that says nearly three quarters of an F and P five hundred forms and roughly half of the S. and P. Fifteen hundred companies\nHave by laws that require CEOs to retire at a certain age most typically sixty five Warren Buffett since late eighties he's still shows up at work every day but the he's the exception not the rule\nAnd uh the average age of S. and P. CEOs as it is in the mid fifties\nBut more and more of these companies have mandatory retirement age is sixty five Seventy and yet you've got the U.S Senate that has people that are in in their eighties\nShould we have an age limit for politicians for one for seven nine when six twenty to start with Nicole in Sheboygan identical\nI'm really as a matter of fact um I Can't be happening in in in what I eat I start actually had a nice when you end up in other actor in Ames\nMhm what would you say that wage would be\nI Know that my parents maybe that they need to eat what that means but I mean you can call me starting in Lancaster in front of each individual\nRed and of course you've got to generalize but you've also got\n... visited Syria ration of physical skills and and that's just a reality no matter how in shape you are\nYou know your ... your body starts to break down over time and I guess\nI I kind of look at that as well as part of the thing that's frustrated me Nicole is of course\nThese entrenched senators in particular\nAnd once you've been there forever you have this power you have this incredible ability to raise money so you know as you get older you become more and more entrenched it's tougher to get you out of office and as a result you you start to wonder are we really getting it is it time for is it time for people to move on and\nAnd is that time eighty four eighty five years old\nI don't think so I think as much earlier than regular in the area and I think they have very very easily either people around that there's a lot of money going and\nYeah I Know they just called because you're right too because you know a lot of times and and you saw this in in the past with senators\nAnd congressmen who were extremely old\nUm [noise] and and candidly who's best days were behind them\nThen what happened was you know they had you had the age that took care of all the work and\nIt's just absolutely fine you love being out here for opening day are at Fort one forceps what six or the mortgage\nPocket techs lined up several months ago apparently foreign investors came to the state\nAnd said hey you got problems with building the rose tell you what we'll we've got a billion plus dollars we will essentially by these roads we'll fix them up will repair and we'll build them\nAnd then we'll charge people to use them right the state of Wisconsin said no for one for seven nine what six twenty let's start with Peter and Milwaukee Peter your first\nYear in front of your mind off thank you for calling to her\nAbout it is good and then it's not a good idea and how are you a matter of finding someone who really\n... from the nominee may ... may maybe a year and a winter when I'm home you might among the leading memory right ...\n\nExpects them to go in and tells us private how funny\nIt would be better to do that otherwise you remember one has to be a cause and how much they can increase that phone because the European countries including Paul every year more than I Am in their own\nRight now they have to call Peter I I'm with you I mean I I think Governor Walker did absolutely right thing by saying thanks but no thanks [laughter] we appreciate your interest I mean here's the bottom line I we have I think a really screwed up system\nParticularly in Wisconsin when it comes to some of the stuff that's out there and the lack of controls and things like that I think it screwed up but the one thing that I Will say is at least you got some degree of accountability and and you've got the state that has the power\nTo at least come in when you have the road builders that you know do the lousy jobs in the cases that they do and they're they're able to hold them accountable and in the state at the end of the day is ultimately responsible I don't think this is an example where you want to privatize stuff\nFor one for seven nine one six twenty days in graft and Dave you're on WGM Jay good afternoon\nI agree with it your first stop let me say that every time this road thing Congress off my just got mad at night I drive between Milwaukee and ... and ... again ...\nMadison every day and and the roads that I use our rating and even now I get into the city I'm On the roads are terrible but I don't think that just got one small I think that mismanagement by Tom\nBarrett but aside from that\nUm I think privatization is a is not a good route to go down one of the public transportation and roads it's one of the most basic functions of government like providing police and fire service and write off privatization is gonna be\nProfit driven if there is no profit\nUm what are they gonna do closed the roads like Toys R us in Boston in a store on the show where where are they going to make a profit they're going to increase fees to the point that it's unaffordable or some people that drive on the roads or they're going to skimp on the roads themselves to the safety standards are going to be high\nQuality or instead of a like Milwaukee County following snow to have a air world policy they're going to stay well we're only going to uh ones that they can't afford a thorough it's a you know ... I'm Sorry I I think it's a huge disaster and again I\nI I agree with you and see and I I think you know there are some things that candidly I think you can do the privatization might make sense for her and\nAnd but I think you have to look at it on a case by case basis\nI mean it's one thing to say okay can can we hire out custodial services or something like that\nIt's another thing when you're talking about again like you were saying what are the basic requirements of government which is providing rose complete completely different than I think you can support some forms of privatization without saying hey turning into turning the rolls over to a private European company would be a good idea\nI think that's being done in in some cases like the city of Milwaukee\nUm during large snowstorms they do hire private ... so they don't have a hundred thousand dollar trucks shedding or ... months of the year I'm I'm all for that but the government is controlling those contracts and\nAgain I just want to reiterate the south east was constant the roads are perfectly fine\nBecause I think it's called ... I mean here's\nHere's part of the issue and and people complain about the roads and\nAnd and I do I do think it's it it shows how far we've come in Wisconsin over the last eight years that this is now becoming a primary issue we're not worried about jobs we're not worried about the economy that's all going crazy [laughter] we're not worried about the state of taxation but you know we're concerned if there's a pothole well there's always been potholes that's kind of the reality\nIs always a challenge though to figure out how you're going to do the road building we need to do\nDo the expansions and also do the repairs and I think it's it's fair to have an ongoing conversation about it but as far as privatizing this I think it's a bad idea carrying Sheboygan Gary you're on WGM Jay good afternoon\nAfter it on a I have to look at Chicago at a fast ... daily get down there by Shelley leaders of the parking layers\nI have to look at Chicago at a fast ... daily ... meters was ... years all St Mary's little private company and it just better and he'll form because for one thing if Korea revenue they thought it was\nThe other thing is that what was what they were\nA half the street or if it goes meters out they get charged for that and the last thing I heard was this company ... story in Chicago for forty seven million dollars in revenue\nEach has been a disaster all around us a call ... okay I I have no problem with thinking outside the box or any stuff like that but I did at some point in time you want to say look we we really got to go carefully here the governor apparently shot this whole concept down from the jump I think that was the right move this is not\nAn idea whose time has come it's one fifty to this is Jeff Wagner WGM Jay were broadcasting live\nFrom outside and Miller Park people are coming in everybody's excited about the game stick around [laughter] [noise]\nIt's one of the ... weather WGM Jay broadcasting live from outside of Miller Park\nGrills or going people wandering in the gates are now open first pitch a little bit over two hours from now slightly after four o'clock I'm going to be with you for a little bit over an hour that we're turning over Greg Mexican and we're going to turn it over to our brewers pregame thing\nAs we move into the two o'clock hour we're going to kind of segue into some conversations about baseball ... not the ... and that type of stuff but some\nSome bigger picture type of points as we talk about you know what games like this I mean\nIt's been it's been seven years seven years since the last playoff game that I Will tell you I remember I remember the first round playoffs um when the brewers beat Arizona in five games against inning of game five about as ... as exciting as it could possibly get and\nThat's the type of stuff that people will remember if you were a long suffering brewers fan you can remember the world series in Nineteen eighty two you can remember getting back to the playoffs in two thousand eight you can remember two thousand eleven and now here it is two thousand Eighteen you gotta teams got the potential potential I say to go all the way and we're talking about\nNow playoff rituals and showing up in person and supporting your team that's all coming up in a couple of minutes before that I just want to offer a comment about a story that that occurred yesterday I mentioned briefly on the air\nYou periodically you will have these group of protesters many of whom are paid by various unions and what they do is they show up outside of fast food places and they're arguing [laughter] we need Fifteen dollars an hour for minimum wage well of course the problem is\nIf you if you have government for example forcing somebody to pay a minimum wage that doesn't match up with what the job is worth\nWell you're you're you're going to have a recipe for disaster you know if you had a lot of fast food places that would actually adopt a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage what you would see is you would see massive unemployment she massive layoffs because the fast food franchise ease but they're going to end up doing is they're going to automate\nThey're going to say okay well instead of having free people behind the counter taking orders what we're going to do is we have one person behind the counter and we're going to have a kiosk well in any event as the people that are protesting in many cases their their\nUnion organizers who are paid to go out and show off well yesterday they showed up at a McDonald's north avenue the owner McDonald's close so there there wasn't anything to see so what the group the damage is an effort to get attention is instead of protesting the Donald's they decided to walk into the intersection shit [noise]\nWow [noise] wow we're up one oh in there in L.

have a chance I appreciate the phone call this is the team that had the most wins in the national league\nOr sometimes I feel like there's this sense that there are an underdog\nAnd I get that from um from like gambling odd standpoint they are not the favorite to win the world series in fact they're not even the favorite to win the national league I last time I checked the Dodgers\nI have a little bit better odds than the brewers but from a raw statistical standpoint this simplistic to stick in the world and when you get right down to it the only statistic that really matters at the end of the day\nIs wins and losses in the brewers\nHad more wins than any other team in the national league they are all legit World Series contender I Do think the Dodgers are legit World Series consider I don't think it's only the brewers are not going to be a cake walk into the world series but absolutely they could get there I don't think anybody should be shocked at this point\nUnderstand all the

it's the playoffs people it's Tom this is a good Rockies team there's a reason they got to this point this is a very very good Rockies team they scored\nA couple of runs in the ninth some things went the brewers away early in the game that maybe don't doesn't go in the night there was an air German shepherds wasn't quite as on but the brewers when this game enjoy this when playoff Windsor special and\nProbably eighty percent of the text messages and get them right now are are very negative the brewers won this game enjoy the playoffs are about surviving and they banned scene in ...\nThe playoffs are about surviving in advancing punching your weight or win and that's what the brewers did today I'm not saying there's not things that we can talk about obviously there are that's part of the fun of baseball but we don't need to be negative about this the brewers won just\nIf you're if you're on your phone right now typing a text message and there's anger coming out of your thumbs just take a pause and say to yourself the brewers won three to over the Rockies let's go down to the clubhouse Greg magic with Curtis Granderson\nStanding by brewers outfielder Curtis Granderson Chris won't be through the the mean shifting in the ninth inning in the middle of like it was going to be disaster you guys are do you live in the dugout when you've been a disastrous for me it was shot\nAnd then you realize that you still got twenty seven obviously within long as we can get out of the situation which are Jay Jay was able to do in that situation\nSo I was at that point definitely don't need to understand that we got some great coming up to give us an opportunity and we have sort of coming in who's been lights on all season long for so happens once when I was like is it tonight on the team in Oregon they should understand that we've done it before and I just don't we don't even\nTalk to combine to some of the navy and the opportunities and really you voting

I've always been a big believer and you can pass and tortured you just keep them on movies you've got an opportunity to do some things and\n... men behind me in that situation if I can get it and we got a chance to get things going yellow started by getting out and get in the next guys up and sure enough the more time to continue to put guys after I got to college traffic you have enough to do stuff the Rockies in a nice anyway was doing\nListening is to walk out of your was when after looking like it was all working to plan and really in some in shifts but to be able to walk out of there was a win for\nYou know especially when you have a five game series anytime you can pick up especially the first game of the series is very important to you Mike Colorado had plans especially recently all season long you want to go ahead and try to get as many of which is you can because anytime there in the ball game they had a chance to strike you saw it again in my city and he didn't want to go ahead and give them more\nOpportunity so you know and a half hour\nThat yet again for doing an amazing job for ... and when he's on a female and typically more difficult for for righteous defense

official about against him so\nI'm definitely has a plus asphalt slider from what I saw from everybody else was very good as well in the office of this amazing things he's brought him into that situation again if not Charles definitely one of these are the games are coming up in the series [noise]\nI ... just a little while go downstairs with Curtis Granderson a back to the tax message is getting a lot of text messages asking why Domingo Santana was the pinch hitter delete things off into third for brand new ... and I think there's a different conversation then\nShould have branded Woodrow extended I have a day to day the plan was they they were going with the plan the pictures weren't going to hit today and that every time a pitcher spot came up\nThey were going to use a pinch hitter so then that creates the question said ten has been one of your hottest bats down the stretch the season why is he the guy coming up there and the third inning and I guess my question to you would be\nWho else should have been a day or they're more outfielders on this roster that if you're going to burn up position player group you're probably going to burn an outfielder you're not going to use camp rocks in that situation because quite honestly\nYou're saving Roxanne probably for pinch running duties if need be through really the pinch runner that's why he's on this roster and could also be used as a defense replacements so he's probably not the first guy that you want to come up with a pensioner you don't want to use a Curtis Granderson\nA in that spot either you're saving Jonathan scope and you're saving their not present Casey to double switch out or an infielder so Curtis so odd to me go Santana as the guy in that situation I think it's not so much about why Curtis Granderson there I think the answer is more about why not everybody else\nIn that situation or why excuse me let me rephrase that\nIt's not so much about why Domingo Santana there it's more about why it's not anybody else there and I think the arguments are stronger for why you would not bat those other players in that situation this is different than a week ago when he had nine million guys on the roster\nAnd you were able to bring up a ... D known you were able to bring up\nAnd Eric themes and those kinds of guys to the plate they aren't there anymore you're back to a twenty five man roster and at the playoff series playoff game you need to utilize that roster a in a very smart to kind of way back to the phones Sam on the east side hey Sam thanks for holding your on WGM Jay\nHey Matt thanks for having me but\nYeah I I'm I'm you know I Love listening to your your your knowledge and be a fourth grade but\nI mean but I'm not going to criticize anything tonight I think I'm\nI'm ... I'm happy we got the when I think Craig council has a great form and closing came there but I think you've got the sequence wrong I just think I think ...

down relatively quietly in the top of the tens of ... story it comes on\nHe does a nice job he has a one two three inning and he is able to force things to the bottom of the any\nSo in the bottom of the inning Christian he always comes up the place he starts behind than the count owing to add to his credit he was able to really work things and he eventually is moves up to where he takes first on a walk so goes from two to three two and then he draws the walk\nSo that puts him on first he is then able to move to second\nAnd throw it away\n\nThat's another thing you gotta worry about a lot of

the brewers as they get the W. final score intent innings three to rulers want to do in the playoffs the Rockies oh and one the brewers reruns seven it's one air they leave in the Rockies to runs\nFor

three thousand\nThree hundred and eighty two folks we got a bunch of callers on the line we will get to them in a moment as we do start to wrap up the program but up from the brewers that club house where he has been joining us throughout the course of the program we've got a ... year and\nA Greg this is a game where you can look Jeremy Jefferson the ninth you can look at the fact that the brewers are don't score or an ad on running the eighth inning but it's the playoffs games are going to be tightened are not going to shut out seems very often they're going to give you the best and the brewers find a way to when I\nGot it felt like it was a a regression to the medium as if you will of the night then it was remarkable what the guys were able to do on the mound to think about the future here the brewers pitching with guys like woodworking burns what they were able to do they're going to see pretty Peralta before the series is over as well maybe as early as tomorrow\nBut you know if you took a hey maker any real to come back in ... you're on the ropes but not on the road\nAnd then put together some nice of bats is still the storyline is not a blown sea of opportunity and how ... brilliant plan ended up back in the ninth inning\nYou get exactly what you want to set up and the brewers were not able to push some runs across in the late innings they had some great opportunities a couple of buddies running misused as well but\nAble to put it together and that you lose this one are really really ... clauses do but uh the winter's even that much sweeter I got to come back again tomorrow in some of the civil or energy to try to do the Rockies and protect the whole field\nOf five minutes left to the program ... year for a second while we get to a couple of phone calls we will start with a gym in Sherry bill hey Jim thanks for holding your on WGM Jay\n... thanks I didn't have to wait in an hour that was nice [noise] um I just wanted to get the one thing I'm not going to complain about the book because how many other teams in baseball can have a book can gain we've got the best bulletin in baseball and they're not perfect\nBut you know you've got the ... guys out there and you did a great job\nOne thing that gets me is the bases loaded thing\nAnd I was doing some checking and I think that the brewers are still meeting the majors in leaving the bases loaded with oats going or run\nThat's got nothing to do with the book and they could have put this game on ice if they would have scored with the bases loaded and there's so many times this year ... and ... the bases loaded\nSo it baseball stuff's going to have in Milwaukee people have to learn to win gracefully there used to be in the post season so the team is learning how to function\nNow the ... just up guessing second guessing the manager when we when that's the key part don't be complaining when we when we got a great team and we got to stick behind them each get behind the manager\nRaj him appreciate the phone call and\nA great I think Jim's point you can look at that eighth inning and man if the brewers would have been deployed losing this game of that ball by black men down the right field line would have been a millimeter towards the line and that any continues to go in a bad way we would be sitting there looking at that age ... insane they just needed to make contact\nAnd there's always a handful of lazy you look at one run games in ... what does it boils down to it's usually a handful of different places that happened I mean Ryan Braun admitted that was his call to try and you\nKnow students from second based on a wild pitch or any cedar was kind of back and forth halfway down the line he was looking at the cats are trying to figure out where the ball was by the time you look back at Ron Brown was already on top of them so that was a risk bronco was worth taking in the early stages of the game was to out\nI'm probably wouldn't have done that a little bit later in the game and then you look at Lorenzo came to your throwing a ball to home on a sec point when he probably should have wrote the third base to give that rotor because getting a guy at home it just wasn't going to work\nThe balls that Ron hit very hard off the glove of a first base for the third baseman instead of first and third and a great situation late in the game you're talking about an out of a hard hit ball by Ron so I mean so many ways like this I mean it was from a baseball fan the standpoint\nIf you weren't locked into this game I'll tell you what there is some amazing stuff that happened at a series of plays that boy just inches away from affecting the result\nLast phone call the night I only have about thirty seconds I Know you've been holding just got a moment for a DJ in greenvale DJ you've got the last word about twenty seconds or an WGM Jay\nHello DJ we've lost DJ he does not have the one of the war emotional after the ... yes he does not have the word\nSo here's the deal coming up tomorrow it is a game to this series you guys think the brewers they need to come up with a few more than seven hits that can't be leaving a ten runners on and we'll see how it ended up going down is going to be a leash shot scene he is going to be pitching on short rest tomorrow\nThe thing is you want to get that will done you want to get your will updated\nBecause otherwise I Want you to think about this you know this hard your minor children you don't do it will\nYour state will decide who raises your children your no count relative that you don't even talk to be the one the court decides is raising your kids do you want that you don't\nWant to make sure your kids are raised how you want them to be raised by who you trust to raise them no way you can do that with the will let me tell you what it will can't do a\nLot of times we'll have been a fishery designations on a life insurance policy or on a bank account or any variety of times where we're asked like in a four one K.\nMorass if we want to designate have been a fishery makes no difference what you're saying you're will\nHave you've already designated been a fishery that designation Trump's your will\nVery common issue involves where somebody his name somebody has it been a fishery or something who they used to be in a relationship where there used to be married to and you forget about it\nAnd then you don't realize that when you die that person you're not with any more cats that stuff\nI think about these things is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Tom\nI'm doing good how are you a bad\nTime you want to talk about helping your young daughter get in the habit of saving money is that right\nKind of um we've been doing it for a wheel\nUm we've been doing it for a wheel is I plan on college that I saw before she was born and that has all their money but I Want I Want to put it someplace or that she doesn't know about it but until she really mature enough to know about it honestly\nOkay and the thing is if you set up a custodial account how old is she now fourteen oh\nOkay so if you open an account for fourteen year old and you open a custodial account generally the money becomes hers depending on the state of Eighteen or Twenty one but what you can do and I'm going to give you the car cancer not a book or legal answer OK\nOkay where you can do is who gets the mail every day I mean she never even has to know that this money is there and even when it comes in adult the male is still coming to the address of record which has yours and she never even has to know that\nSo what type of account like can I Do like that's my problem like I thought about a lot but he needs to be made money do that but if we do console and I just keep putting taxable money now there will be okay\nYeah but see even with a custodial raw\nYou might say she starts working and the next couple of years and then she because Roth eligible you start putting money into it she still gained control of that yet what your state considers to be Asian majority Eighteen or Twenty one she has control\nSo you have to do something big is this is a case where what's for the child's good is you don't let her know there is any money there even when she is a young adult and you don't even bring it up\nTil she's old enough to response William and with maturity handled the money\nSo me and my wife could we both beyond the custodial count and I'm sure that it would just like all three of us and this\nOne in early you know it depends on the the investment house used but generally you have one parent as the custodian for the benefit of your child's name but depending on where you set up an account they may allow you to set up both of us custodians\nNow there is what's the minimum ... minimum wage in town\nYou can start an account like if you go to Charles Schwab you can do it with a hundred dollars\nYou know I mean per year like this if we open ... do you how much money do I put in your career you\nDon't have to put any kind of I mean once you've established an account with the account minimum you can let it sit or add to it as you wish\nOkay so that of work and then a Roth I could do that\nSorry so that when I say you're done\nSo that you know like a raw savings account\nI Know you can't do or raw till she has a job so that's got to wait a year or two to she starts working and then you can put up to fifty five hundred into a raw now by the way the legal answer if you want to keep\nThe money away from her until you feel she's mature enough is much more expensive process where a trust can be established using a lawyer who specializes in wills estates and trust\nAnd you can fully legally keep the money away from her tail is set time much later in adulthood but I think when you're starting with a smaller account just keep it simple keep the account a secret from your fourteen year old\nMary's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi merry

particularly on entry level homes homes that first time homebuyers would be interested in\nIn much of the country today it's actually cheaper to rent than it is to by\nThere are a few exceptions but most of the country renting is effectively cheaper\nSo buying a home would have to be for having a sense of permanence or being in the right school district 'cause you have kids now it has to be for

thinking of\nService which is advertised by financial companies one of which I Am a investments that they claim that they can store all your financial products at one place or I guess the crowd safely and I wonder if you've heard of it and if so what do you think of\nIs is fidelity product for all the investments exactly nobody asked me about that in a good while it's called like a fidelity safely like what they call it exactly\nFits say All right let's say at the\nRight so what they do is they provide you know for ... any of the\nBig investment companies have massive data stories centers that they either operator they lease\nAnd so the capacity required to soar digital records like um account records insurance policies um you know special documents you want to keep track\nOf like you gotta will anything like that\nIf you want to have a digital copy of them the capacity\nThat they make available is teensy tiny you know it doesn't take\nA lot of of um cloud storage at all to do that\nSo it's really smarter fidelity is away particularly to get their own customers interested in having backup copies of records is good for fidelity is good for you and they make\nIt free as I recall not just ... customers but you don't you have to be a customer of Fidel it easy to use it\nI had no idea [noise]\nSo I I if it's still true that anybody can use ... say\nIt's a great way for you to store all your digital records you know a lot of people now use Google Photos to do it where you essentially take pictures of your documents and store them in Google Photos free storage forever\nOr the only

whatever money he puts in that's all she wrote\nYeah ... I didn't have kids who are able to fully fund spousal rough for me that we're only able to ... to ... I found some dollars and for our K ... and so I was wondering why should we continue in Portland K event like apple or say when you start has a\nGreat question so the advantage of the four oh one K. is it just comes out automatically here now to think about it and it just happens in that's a that's a valuable thing not having to have the intention but getting it done but it sounds like he was a couple\nHad been getting it done anyway with your raw you're getting it fully funded so if you were to choose if you in fact use a low cost provider for that raw\nAll things being equal with no match and the four one K. I'd love it if he instead of contributing to the employer four one K. put that five thousand or maybe bump it up to fifty five hundred into his own Roth\nOkay what do you recommend that rolling whatever it in that one day and\nYou can't do that while he works there okay so the money that\nThey're stays there but putting future contributions into a raw I think could be very valuable\nOkay and so it's just better tax\nSo the difference is the employer plan may be a moderate costs low costs are high cost plan okay but you got the underlying expenses if you use one of the aisle cheap oil companies I have on my investment guide\nThem the money is going to be going in low cost and the difference is the the four oh one K. the money that goes and gets a tax deduction up front but everything in the account including its earnings will be taxed down the road right where the Roth is the opposite\nThe money that goes in the raw has already been tax\nBut it grows tax free and the spent tax free now there would be an exception to him doing the Roth as an alternative what kind of money is your husband making a year in general terms\nI mean he makes less sick\nIf he's making low six figures been scratch what I said and they should stay in the four one K. okay with that because\nThe tax benefit of being able to put money in pre tax is valuable enough at a six figure salary ... to his advantage to continue to put into four one K. even without a match\nOkay but I Will say that if he is in a job in the six figures it'd be great if he put aside more money each year than the five grand\nOn our we're paying for a full say are a little oh\nGod I got it okay\nAll right but in that case would that kind of income he should keep doing what he's been doing even though they're\nNot being generous anymore are all matter most most people don't make income and that kind of stratosphere yeah them for them doing the raw would be a better choice but your husband's case\nIt would be a better choice but your husband's case before when Kay would probably be the best thing to continue\nTaking my call right have a great day [noise] I hate to hear\nDavid's with us on the Clark Howard show hello David Hey clerk David you're thinking of buying a new home from a company that when you walk on line people hate their guts\n[laughter] well that's that's what it seems like and you know we're considering buying a home from a large national home builder and the online reviews are so good and that concerns me yeah but then again I looked at some of the online reviews for other large builders and there aren't any better so I'm Wondering\nPerhaps it's only the people that are dissatisfied are leaving the reviews are\nWell it's a great question you ask and it it has long been an issue in home building is that it's very rare that somebody says I Love my bill to her I Love them I mean I Can't wait to have been bailed me another home some\nDay you know you just don't hear that because it's a tough business but I'll tell you this my bias\nHas always been to buy used homes instead of buying a new home\nReally because we're we're considering both\nOnce you enable say Alexa open WTO O.

a YouTube when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over the shoulder I mean what's interesting is Robert ... who's this a PHD used on always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his content so it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just\nDemonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide if their whim a how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites [noise] well I mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think the big example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand it happens all the time and and and what the eggs that then I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting when we go through this in the in the film\nIs during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John uh blindly um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republicans several Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status\nAnd what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis the results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut here's the real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran\nUndecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially a lecture since that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer\nAt the

so your take on the Murkowski a no vote at this stage of it I I Can't imagine she would shift in her in the voting for the full Senate tomorrow\n[noise] yeah we actually do have some some intriguing drama here it is interesting too if you were listening to the role mansion I think with a laugh\nOr a lucky that I vote in there right at the end and um so it was it was up in the air there that it's really interesting this is always kind of come down to these four they can't lose they can't lose too and it looks like they May of last one is kind of\nHard to imagine that someone would vote no on cloture and that gets on the nomination but I guess it's possible it's also possible that some of some of them are like Susan Collins is I guess it's going to announce her vote this afternoon\nImagine how you can you do now that we're living in limited expended your wife in your yard have chosen green is great you got to see how well you haven't invited me so\nWe had an empty yard and also living

be nice and dry inside Miller Park the other big story of course nationally is the votes\nOn Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and I spent some time really show talking about that counter off and I also went back and forth on that or just the impact of this decision\nAnd if you don't know if you weren't listening we heard a little bit of the of the voting procedural votes live it ended up fifty one forty nine high which moves it to a full Senate vote tomorrow on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nAnd I'm like I spend a lotta time on the history here of course probably almost two months ago now the president nominated Brett Kavanaugh we have the first hearing\nThen we have the second hearing there was a around\nSexual assaults none proven uh ended up with an additional FBI request that was completed the senators those chose to a look at that documents in the basement of the Senate office building\nStarting yesterday morning and I think it's interesting I don't think every senator looked at it which is telling in its own way\nBut at the end of all that it comes down to the votes and in the case of the of the a procedural vote today the one surprise that I noticed\nWas that Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voted no no it doesn't mean definitely that she's going to vote no on the confirmation it does suggest that that's where that will go to the vote was fifty one forty nine ah Joe Manchin the only Democrats from West Virginia and not a surprise given it's a very conservative states\nAre Susan Collins was ... Ah yes votes Jeff Flake was a yes vote now that doesn't pre determined to vote tomorrow\nBut I'm guessing and obviously things can change on a moment's notice if Mitch McConnell scheduled these votes he's pretty sure he's got the fifty he needs and then you can lose one more\nBut I think he's in a good place and all I can change between today and tomorrow there's also the senator Danes who daughter's getting married you have to walk down the aisle and they may have to if they don't have the votes may have to a shift the timing of that final vote so that he can\nDo his duty as a father for his daughter enjoy the wedding and they get back to Washington DC for that final vote so that's part of part of the story line as well I've said it for the last week or so I think that Kevin I Will be confirmed that's the beginning of his story\n\nWhile this has been a a drama like unlike we've ever seen before in this country this is the beginning of the story what's happening in Washington DC yesterday and today and will happen if Kavanaugh is confirmed rents escalation of protests and escalation of anger\nOne party is going to lose their mind over this\nThe question for all of us out here who observe these things will they lose their minds to the point where it doesn't just charge up their base but says the Republicans I don't like that behavior I don't like how cabinet was treated\nI'm going to show up and vote in November and could that shift some of this and Suzie as a gap in recent polls have who suggested it's closed quite a bit if ... if not completely to the Republicans saving\nSenate certainly and potentially even the house and there's about twenty three seats twenty four seats that have to shift in the house to change that from Republican control to democratic so there's a lot on the line here\nTomorrow's vote if it happens tomorrow if it happens Sunday will be the clothes for Brett Kavanaugh yay or nay and I as I've said I think he's going to be confirmed\nThat's not the end of the story this is going to continue to ramp up or the midterms will be the next target for Democrats the talking points are already out there if you watch any of the coverage on television or read any the the op ed pieces\nHere's one FBI wasn't allowed to do their job first of all nobody tells me up you know what to do if they see something they investigate the talk of the witnesses clearly in this case\nClearly\nWhich has been mishandled by Democrats from the from the moment they decided to out a woman who asked for confidentiality into all the actors just say that can't be\nProven user commonsense and she was outed for a reason they wanted their Anita Hill moments that's all this ever was about ... they didn't care about Christine Blasey Ford\nDidn't care about how she was sacrificed in the cause of blowing up a Supreme Court nomination of this president they didn't care about any of that stuff you think Republicans outer they didn't have the information to use your head\nUtilized common sense tells you where that story will go that's number two of our foreign attend the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee and stay in the

this kind of vitriol directed at another group of public safety professionals suggest to me you're not ready for this job suggested that you bring with your application to this commission a bias that suggests you can't look at things objectively\nNow mayors pick these people based on their history and the experience and that's all great and you were if he was a former firefighter and that part's fine but when you read those kinds of comments to suggest that something is not right here\nYou must make sure that anyone on the fire and police commission can look at things objectively using their experience to understand what what makes the most sense for these departments to make us safer to run officially and to move forward with out\nAnd as far as Tammy Baldwin\n\nAnd of course we all knew she said no before she ever even ... she was in the Chuck Schumer campus like yeah we we heard just say his name but we're still going to go no and frankly I said this last week after the requests for

Turner hall last night and a boy\nThere's still a lot of construction everywhere of course the Bradley Center will be coming down at some point year and a as we get ready for the launch of the box new season in the entertainment district and all that but this announcement by our friends with the Business Journal about a new Twenty one storey apartment tower\nLocated east Gilbert avenue north Van Buren street two hundred and thirty eight feet tall two hundred and one apartments first five stories concrete parking structure nothing unique about that but all the residential floors above that\nWould have a structural scales enough mass timber beams and you've seen these have you been in Milwaukee the third ward has a lot of these buildings these things are like two feet\nThick and it's kind of a homage to the past and\nThose kind of buildings are unique this will be one of the tallest in the world with that kind of construction framing there are some proposals to do some even larger ones in Chicago\nOr there's been talk about uh thirty seven story building that that one didn't go forward and some other theoretical proposals for eighty story wood frame buildings don't know if that's going to happen but this one is more than likely to go forward\nAnd it's it's not where the former and why does restaurant is and as I said at first five floors concrete parking and everything from their up twenty four inches a twenty four inch timber beams\nOr the Tim Goldman director market based new land so this this is mark and becoming a world class city more is there is a world class building\nWe've already started the conversation with investors we know the excitement is there you don't think it'd be difficult for lenders to see that this product is needed as I said these are all over the third word if you've been in any of those buildings those restaurants those companies um they they they're utilized all over the place there's one in Vancouver that's Eighteen stories\nWhich set the world record when it open more than a year ago so this one\nUh that would go higher than that could potentially set a world record in how cool would that be on the market would

all of us so um there's a lot of excitement and walk in his new building to look at an east kilowatt avenue north Van Buren street two hundred and thirty eight feet tall two hundred and one apartments

Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court I Want to get your thoughts about this nomination at this time and kind of what it means to you want as a woman to as as a Simpson United States what does this nomination and you\nTo a much tighter or if not not at all now because of of the energy images Asian of the Republican base do you believe that that's something Republicans play can place when the next few weeks before the November elections\nI definitely think that the enthusiasm gap is closing and I I think now that we have early voting and its opening Republicans need to go out capture this and I think it's an opportunity that our state uh candidates are revoke mayor Scott Walker you need to capitalize on that said Ron Johnson just wait in the morning\nAnd I think we need to to rally around that and get out the vote\nRight I I completely agree and I think it will I think it will be very good for Republicans now and\nThere's an interesting time because you know worst we've seen throughout the course of the summer that this big gap and enthusiasm as I said it's narrowed and and will this be the storyline but what happens in Washington DC can change on a dime store you can come and go the president can tweak something and change the dynamic quickly\nLet me ask you about the me too movement I uh I'm sitting here we're too smart intelligent women you guys watch what's happening in this country you hear about it from a different perspective than I Do\nAs far as the cabinet are cheering the nomination process and all the things that have been swirling around that does is hurt to me too movement or help it\nI think it hurts me too movement has always thought what we saw on and meet you as a celebrities and lots of different women I mean women from work one from all different all different parts of life\nBringing bringing for accusations and even with the celebrities like that there were investigations done in the public the same way that's happened and what does investigation showed is that allegations can be brought with so little evidence and these things these accusations can be used is near a man's life\nAnd so I think that's what it was played out over the last two weeks here in in the public eye and I think it's hard to me too movement because people can now see a maybe maybe this accusation being brought against this man has as little evidence is what we we've seen with Kavanaugh\nWhy we're at the one year anniversary I think it's almost exactly one year when Melissa mullah Alyssa Milano cut a reinvigorated Disney to hash tag and it was it's been warned\nOr in the past that if this goes too far it's going to fall apart I think we saw exactly to your point Corey it's falling apart listen this isn't about sexual harassment this isn't about sexual assault ... you know this isn't about gender pay gap ... ... what is it about we can't answer that question\nCould just leave her hashtags that that piece of this could that directs significant damage because I've said for a long time you should listen to women always doesn't mean you have to abandon any presumption of innocence or any demand for some real evidence to what you're saying I think that's the risk for the me too movement is\nWe don't have that here hurt her house 'cause he was before because we're not corroborated her her friend who was at the parties can't even tell\nInvestigators of this happened this has to be a negative for me too movement based on just the fact there was so high profile and yet ultimately probably gonna backfire on them\nWell and you took it all the way you took it all the way to prove it prove it because this exists well guess what we we tried to prove it and it didn't exist there was nothing there ... and I were talking in the lobby before about how you know if you go to a party and and some guy of being a jerk you tell somebody\nSay you're ... you're going to say like watch out for this guy like yeah he's he's dangerous away from him\nAnd if it happens ... that's what you should do if anything comes out of this me too movement it's the women if something happened to speak up right away it don't wait for for years and years and years and don't be course by politics to make this reality\nFor all the men out there and I'm On that side of this equation so for us we're looking at this and saying okay so here's a guy that accused of something about the highest level he's going to be on the Supreme Court hopefully tomorrow he can't get any of his reputation but I'm just destroyed and that's all because one person decided\nShe may believe what you're saying but you couldn't preventing ... and she made and she decided to come forward socially lawyers process up is that fair\nIt's absolutely not fair and I think it is scary for men\nI'm ... and its atmosphere specifically white men I mean I think white men are have become the victim of all of all the stuff in the last year here I'm Mark a couple of years here with Trump\nBut um I I think I think it's it's scary I mean my husband my father there are good men many many good men more good men and badminton I Would say\nAnd for people to just be able to bring any accusation on such little evidence and ruin a man's life I mean has he thought his wife his children his daughters watching watching and have to answer these ridiculous questions\nUm and in front of the entire country ah it it's just it's crazy it's really crazy\nFeminist pick and choose which women they support\nOh that is a good question I think they they do\nThey do I mean what where are the people rallying around Nikki Haley where are the women were the people rallying around strong smart conservative women you know what we're we're strong and smart and and we don't need that validation because we have the you know the sense that we're doing the right thing and we're led by\nA ... you know by ... by by paying attention to the facts\nAnd here's the thing you you just mentioned the one person that one person I don't think it's Dr Ford it's Dianne Feinstein I think she is at the center of that she had the opportunity and she she didn't take it she needs to be called the carpet at some point\nSo yeah I I hardly I hardly think what they've done with for here and support her if not the time I use she didn't want to bring these accusations Ford they they went the twenty days and they drag drag them out when they drive about when they want to do and yeah I I don't think Ford was supporting the least bad I think she was used for the meat is American here\nI'll take a quick break after the break I Want to ask you what the president's role should be in this going forward we we all know even Republicans or conservatives like us understand\nYou sometimes goes too far you mentioned the Korean his his comments and Mississippi I Want to understand what his role can be going forward in the storyline more next friday form to different people from different

home\nOwned and operated since Nineteen thirty four\nI'm with you on this Friday to friday forum to different people sort of all walks of life Tracey Johnston forty theaters [noise] All right so let's talk about the president's\nWe mentioned his comments in a in a sort of the other nights words helpful when at least when it comes to voting what's the president's role if Kavanaugh is confirmed his role between now and November should be what's\nRegarding cabinet and the elections I think I think Trump's role a it's kind of can just be hang glider that I think he should be supporting Republicans of course and um when you know depending on what pops up and then new cycle the next few weeks and months down and you'll be that way though\nI I'm doubtful that he'll be he'll he'll be entirely that way although he has done a good job I think what the Kavanaugh he didn't have the Mississippi thing but during the hearing I think he was pretty quiet and he wasn't tiny and too much there\nWell I think exactly the opposite of Korea I think his role is to get to every state where there's a representative senator who was up for reelection who supported him rally them in that effort and if there is a candidate if there was a senator who voted against them I think he needs to think long and hard about who he supporting and how he's rallying that base\nIs interesting thing about this president she won an election and twenty six you know a lot of people thought he was going to win maybe he didn't even think he was going to win but he did it in a way that you just mentioned she went out there he talked to people in every state he needed to\nHello Hillary Clinton Wisconsin in a couple of other places didn't show up to to get her voters out there and showed up in our in our motel here\nI think there's president understands what his role here and that's the get to the states like you said\nRamped up base up Democrats could hate it but that's how you win elections\nWell and he's going to ... I Hope it comes to Wisconsin at some point he's not going to come to Milwaukee or Madison but you know go out to to walk far northern Wisconsin and and get people excited and get the multiple cars right now we're we're struggling a little bit and even as it comes to the state elections\nWe need to get them out not just for a ... revoke near but Scott Walker and all of the Republicans and they simply and Senate\nAnd Corey I'll give you the last word under the president's role going for we mentioned a little bit but he's going to be passed now trying to energize the Republican base that's that's frankly not been there in the last six months or so we've seen a huge ramp up by Democrats now Republicans neither charged to November can do it [noise]\nYou could have both people working together to to create those outcomes for the kids write write\nTracey Johnston court Peterson joining me on the friday foreign let's shift to the hop [noise] I don't care who goes first explain to me how this thing is going to work how it's going to deal with our Wisconsin winter is how it's going to make sense for anybody except those people will want a free ride from one specific spot to another\nWell I think to answer a lot of those specific questions there there are some people at the city and that that that can that can answer that question so opening on November second we just had that that announcement or the other day and I and I've had the opportunity to meet those people we've taken a group of of our members I work with commercial realtors\nTo talk to Daryl Simpson who is is that the national consultant who's helping to implement that people like like Jeff Polanski damned captain over at the city who who can answer those questions\nAnd ah you know working with the real estate community the mayor came out just this week and said that real estate values have increased like twenty eight percent by either um\nI think the way that they came to those numbers we I I don't exactly know what I Will say is that as\nA people are looking at locating downtown they asked how close are we to the streetcar there is a demand for that and there is demand for for being around that permanent infrastructure and when it comes to extending to the arena or they talk about Miller Park or or other places\nWe're trying to get that funding to to do that\nBut you can't do that unless you've got that that core and that base the mayor acknowledges that it's it's not popular that it's his first line in every four is having fun with it now you have to an end it here that's the thing is is here\nAnd I'm not saying that I think it was the best use of of of funding but it's it's what we had to do and I think we need to to adapt to it and we need to embrace it\nAll right Corey jumping on the hobbit anytime soon\nI I'm really not a fan of the hop Steve and start part of it it's just the fact that it's two and a half miles of track and that's not from one end to the other either like it's like a little spider and all these branches kind of coming out of that\nAnd it doesn't go tiny that you know it makes sense if it went to university campuses and went on their part um if it went to like third war to brief street things like that\nBut that's not what it is it's not it's not going to be solving problems of like people driving while they're drunk laid off from Brady to third word or wherever they're going it's not going to be helping the college kids no cars get places and it doesn't go to like really the poor neighborhoods either so I'm kind of wondering what exactly is what kind of ...\nWell I think we we need to so so I also live downtown for Twenty years that I work right in the heart of the city\nTwenty years ago there were tumble we'd literally down every street in downtown Milwaukee after six PM now we have density which is what we want we have congestion which is what we wanted to people in the suburbs that are listening that don't understand that come and check it out it is it is a much more vibrant place to be and it feels much more like\nA a more metropolitan place and again the hop it's controversial and it it's always going to be controversial but it is here so what are we going to do about it to sit around and complain about it is that a realistic thing to expect\nAnd it makes you a rare bird because of conservative who supports the hops there's not a lot of those people jumping around but\nWell I didn't say I supported him I said I Know it's here and how do we get our head around that and make the best that 'cause I Can't wrap up the tracks right now\nYou know that we cannot do that that's already in place Tracey Johnston court Peterson to different people from all walks of life that's the friday for him after

or not she did vote to send the nomination on so I mean I think a lot of people believe that she's going to be a yes vote\nBut you never know until she firmly commits once that happens that guarantees that you've got fifty votes and again in the case of a fifty fifty tie the vice president would vote either but it again you don't know exactly what can happen\nAnd this is Washington and you look at the Kavanaugh nomination\nSeveral weeks ago\nI think a lot of people would have said this is a done deal and this is a done deal he's come through with flying colors and then you have the allegations of sexual misconduct which is completely and totally thrown a monkey wrench into this but I think if you were a betting person\nYou would say that there are the votes um either fifty one forty nine or or fifty fifty with a tie there are the votes to confirm judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court said in the piece that this was going to be the last time we talk about this because I'm pretty sure there's going to be a vote by tomorrow and I'm On vacation all next week so I\nI assume that by the time I get back a week from Monday that you know actually Brett Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court I guess I could be wrong or\nIf he's turned out by the U.S Senate there will be somebody else who's been nominated by the president but my guess is he he's confirmed we should know that again within the next twenty four to thirty six hours I Do want to open up the phone line so because I Know we've talked about this in great detail\nThe dynamics of this nomination have\nI think change there's been ebbs and flows over the course of the last several weeks\nThis has brought a number of issues to the fore not just the fact that he is a a conservative and not just the fact that he has the ability if he's put on the Supreme Court to be transformative\nA majority vote 'em for the conservative wing presumably for the next several decades this has been a I I figure we speaking a bloody confirmation process\nAnd there's no question that judge Kavanaugh was elevated to the Supreme Court he's\nElevated at the expense of of his reputation I understand that there's a huge chunk of people out there who consider him to be a sexual predator and he's not going to be able to leave that's the bottom line that's the way he's going to be viewed moving forward\nSo for one final time for

Colorado Rockies if you're walking by where we are giving everybody the brewers like show some love make can make it rained signing\nBut you look at all the stuff that's going on I mean I'm just I'm I'm looking at these full parking lots of people walking by\nThis this would have been essentially a vacant area you know maybe there'd be an office building on it or something but the truth of the matter is aren't we so much better off that we've got Miller Park and we got forty five thousand fans coming out to support the brewers and isn't it great that you've got the brewers and we we yeah\nThanks to call I appreciate it for one for seven nine nine which they twenty that is the mortgage talk ... in addition to that\nYou you do have the the spin offs you have\nYou have the merchandise and again I I I'm sitting here watching bar after bar after bar and restaurant that runs these buses to drop fans of the game well okay those are the folks that are coming to the game they were at the bars they were the restaurants they were spending their money\nAnd now they're being dropped off to attend the games I mean that's the collateral spillover that that goes on from having these different types of things that are occurring\nSo we'll have Miller Park we went anything like that going on right now wasn't it a worthwhile investment for one for seven nine nine when six twenty but if he ... mortgage talking text line and that was a decision that was made against twenty three years ago tomorrow Eric in Burlington Eritrean WTO ... that afternoon\nAfternoon um ... what what go brewers today right event\nThat I mean for the investment um I was like a ... grader ... memories with my dad and my grandfather were ... and\nYou know being able to do that as a kid and the thing that they would receive my ... with my wife were ... brewer games and now we're bringing our children for these ... games with my father was their grandfather and pass an arm and then also as far as like the community and giving back I'm about myself and\nWhat were they could do it but during the regular season the brewer ... back to the veterans free tickets are on Sunday\nAll these back right though that the whole community chipping in the fall through the major leagues and I mean why would we want to lose everything like that and risque great who got ...\nNo ... thanks a color is he in in that\nThis has worked out I think like like people hoped it was going to have to work out I mean I Want to give her a lot of credit to more cutting a CEO and and the brewers ownership group that came in\nAnd they made the investments they've been willing to spend the money to produce a winner of a team and the community has certainly embraced this team and they've been brace them through good seasons\nAnd bad seasons but it's a lot more fun to have a good type a season\nBut you you just think what would have happened if we did not have Miller Park ... maybe you don't think the brewers we're going to leave the brewers we're going to leave that is just the reality of this you know you couldn't continue to play and county stadium that just wasn't going to work and if the brewers would have waited and you had made the commitment to have the roof\nI mean my my goodness you look at the ... we have here you know think about what goes on in Detroit and Minnesota and in Cleveland it's some of these other places where they don't have the roof here you know that there's going to be a game and candidly I think if we hadn't have done Miller Park when we did\nThe cost of of the retractable roof would have gotten so prohibitively expensive I'm not sure they would have been able to do it but boy for one for seven nine nine one six when he goes to Dave and grass to Dave you're on WGM Jay good afternoon\nI if I agree with you I Love seeing the brewers there I've been to many games this season um the athletes really do represent the community well but I disagree when you talk about the collateral benefits I don't think any of those buses on the restaurants or bars or strip clubs that you saw\nA drop 'em\nThey're not from ... county they're not from Washington County I would've liked seeing the whole state sharing the burden like they did with the new\nBox arena rather than by county area and\nA seven day I mean I appreciate that but my guess here is that a lot of people that are getting dropped off by these buses are from ... county in Washington County and Racine county and walk ... county and maybe other places as well so\nI mean it is I don't think it's just people from the immediate area who are coming to the games\nWell absolutely not and but there is no collateral fallout for businesses and it was a hockey or Washington County people aren't staying in hotels in West bend to go see a bird and they're not eating in a restaurant in West bend to go see a\nGame and my my last time I know Georgia's brand new years but uh [laughter]\nUm you know these representatives are supposed to represent their constituents and he did not and it was clear that his constituents did not want this and he had to pay the price personally or you\nKnow they think you're right technically you're you're right he he clearly did and and that's why I kind of describe it as a profile in courage because I I think he\nDecided he recognize what it was going to do for his political career but he believed that this was the right thing to do ultimately for his constituents in specific\nAnd for the state in general and so and then I\nLook at it and again I mean I I Know that there's a lot of people that are coming to this game today that are thrilled that are from Racine and have been supporting this team in various ways that are from that area\nAnd yes maybe there wasn't a direct benefit to recede hotels for example but in this particular case I think overall you look at the benefit to the region and you look at the benefits of the state and and that makes it all worth it\nDennis and mosquito dentistry a WTO Jay\nOkay I you know I agree with everything you said about it and George tech a good thing on the right thing a changing his vote to keep the brewers sure if it wasn't for him more we we\nWe will be where we are watching the brewers and they they really did a good super thing and I agree with everything you say and we got baseball's back in Milwaukee were should stay for the next Fifteen Twenty years\nThanks thanks a cold and it's actually I Hope it stays in in Milwaukee for the Next Fifty years I mean I I think that's that's kind of the case I don't know that I'm going to be around to watch it and fifty years but I but I Hope for everybody it's going to be around here and in the reality is if it was it I understand some people thought okay the brewers aren't going to move\nAnd again I I Know enough about the stuff that was going on behind the scenes that the reality is the brewers we're going to move you couldn't continue to play in county stadium and the question was where you're going to make this commitment we did\nAnd it has worked out I think beyond everybody's dreams now we're going to be having this conversation about the bucks arena at some point in time\nTo make a lot of the same arguments about that and I I don't know the jury to me is out on that I supported it because I Hope it's going to lead to a lot of development in that area downtown\n... we'll see we'll we'll be able to assess it ten or Fifteen Years from now but I tell you if you look back on Miller Park to me it is a complete and total when one twenty six year they're double duty object\nWell if you haven't heard me say goodbye now we're darned good\nActually my dad has no qualms about saying we're the best and if you're

writing that if\nSusan Collins senators said she will now vote yes on the cloture votes and will decide on the full Senate votes how she will vote on that in a three PM speech in front of the Senate this afternoon so we'll find out fairly soon here\nWhere we're at my guess is they have the votes if if Mitch McConnell doesn't have the votes and he move this forward that would be one of the most hair brain dumb decisions you've ever made so I'm I'm feeling like they have the votes\nFor confirmation confirmation of bread cabinet but a lot of that will be decided ah in the next twenty four hours I saw this story\nAnd I think it speaks to our current state of affairs when it comes to politics it was a group called the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation\nAnd they did a poll and there was a multiple choice test and it consists of questions from the U.S citizenship tests so somebody wants to a U.S citizen they have to take a test\nYou know how many Americans currents citizens in this poll pass that test one in three thirty three percent here some of the shocking things that come out of this\nPoll\nSixty percent of respondents didn't know which countries the U.S fought in World War two\n\nGermany would be of course the the major when they're the result also found the fifty for seven fifty seven percent of their nominee justice and sit on the Supreme Court that would be nine currently a pending the confirmation of bread cabinet\nSeventy two percent either incorrectly identified aren't sure which states were part of the Thirteen original states that's a little bit tougher\nBut still one I think if you're if you're teaching history properly I think the Thirteen counties questions part of the first second third grade civics class I Would guess\nAnd twelve percent of this poll believed Dwight Eisenhower commanded troops in the civil war\nThat's a a little bit shocking of course uh he was about ah [noise]\nAlmost a hundred years later not quite but uh [noise] so civil war Eighteen sixties World War Nineteen forties so that's kind of the current state of affairs among people to take the test so if you break it down by age\nSixty five or older Seventy four percent answered at least six of the ten questions correctly it's not a bad result\nHere's the part that's scary Nineteen percent so that thirty three percent that ultimately pass is skewed by the higher number among seniors only Nineteen percent\nOf respondents aged forty five or under pass the exam ... less than one in five could pass a citizenship test that people want to be citizens of the United states has to pass\nA thousand people they asked us\nThese questions of\nWith a margin of error of plus or minus three percent\nSo what I'm thinking about these kinds of story\nRelating it back to what's happening now are leaning forward to what's happening how she'd say\nDoes this surprise you that people react in the way they do those types of history not knowing that Thirty years ago Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hyper partisan\nOpenly advocated abortion for abortion rights and women's rights the vote in her Senate confirmation was Ninety six to three\n\nBecause we I think we had it at the time of population that's still understood the importance of history and how the process should really work and I made this claim yesterday and I I feel strongly strongly about it today as I did them\nThis isn't about Brett Kavanaugh\nHe's just a guy that's in that position\nIt could have been one of twenty five other people whoever would have been put forward by this president whoever was on his list as a conservative justice\nSimilar activities similar charges would have been drummed up now it's been a lot of time of yesterday show talking about this timeline and the facts of this story the fact that a woman came forward Christine Blasey Ford and was outed\nBy either a democratic senator or their staff clearly that's the case the fact that they they waited because they have this information in July until two weeks ago to present this information to the other senators in the Judiciary Committee\nKnowing full well what what do the process to try to blow it up what do we see happening now as this process seems to have been moved forward I got to the FBI pardon again mass\nProtests again not about Brett Kavanaugh about this president's being allowed to pick a justice for the Supreme Court that's what this is about\nAll the other stuff window dressing unfortunately two people justice Brett Kavanaugh Christine Blasey Ford they get trashed in the process but it would have been to other people\nBecause that's what Democrats wanted to do here\nAnd you can say I'm hyper partisan and I'm not being fair to Democrats those are the facts\nElections have consequences if Hillary Clinton or presidents she would have selected a very liberal justice for the U.S Supreme Court\nSo don't be surprised what what's happening in Washington DC and the senators at least those voting in favor of Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be intimidated by thugs\n\nAnd threatened and threats from people who really have no knowledge of history no understanding of that's not how this process should work it's been taken over by a few networks\nAnd a few writers who want to characterize this process this way but that's not how it's supposed to work the simple fact is\nThe FBI did its job they've added the candidates Democrats didn't like it they complain about the process to complain about the votes to complain about the justice nothing is going to change that\nElections have consequences this president picked a conservative justice that's the reality we'll find out a lot today\nAn early tomorrow on where the story goes but as I sit here right now it seems more and more likely to justice Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed by the U.S Senate the vote will be close no doubt\n\nAfter the break I Want to have a little bit of more of a polarization where the country's going I just talked about citizenship and the testing the shows we don't know most people don't know what they're talking about when it comes to politics or our country's history is it any surprise that we get what we get to see somebody with you on this Friday right here on WGM J\nThe one degrees at Radio City I just gave me the results of a citizen citizenship tests survey\nDone by the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation [noise] also talking about polarization ice was on my radar yesterday but I didn't get\nA chance to do it because of all the brewers stuff but [noise]\nSurprise surprise polarization between parties is getting worse in this country in between citizens of this country so Michigan State university did a study because nobody's actually Neal associate professor of psychology and global urban studies looking at how parties the political parties worked together or not work together and ah\nWhat is it shows is that and these are his words polarization selling getting worse since the early Nineteen seventies\nIncreasingly worse in the Nineteen nineties and wasn't this\nThis survey wasn't super or to um provide blame or to point blaming any direction\nHe says that we're in the survey regardless of the part that holds the majority in Congress the political divide has widened regardless so there's two kinds of polarization week\nWhen the party simply don't work together don't get along and then strong polarization when one party shutting the other side and how do you know when they when that's happening when you see votes that are just strictly by\nPartisan my party all members or virtually all members votes against whatever the other party is propose policy decisions also\nPortrayed in the attacks on a party so the cabin our situation Democratic senators attacking Brett Kavanaugh Republican senators praising\nBrett Kavanaugh in a non partisan way that would play out based on\nThe facts of the case not be the party affiliation or who were appointed the judge and you can look look any farther than Mitch McConnell the leader of the Senate majority leader and minority leader Chuck Schumer and the Schumer\nNo reporter with each other\nThey call each other colleagues looked at in central every other way they lodged personal attacks at each other\nIt's amazing that the news today forty nine year low on the unemployment rate barely scratched the surface of national media cost because it's all about what's happening in Washington DC with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's historic number almost five decades low yeah that's true to like it doesn't matter it's not the president's credit that's the treasury part of his\nCorey Peterson Johnson more which I'm not sure where the ship to education is is governor and education governor

again in our coverage starts with two forty this afternoon you reach so sheen pitching he did a great job earlier this week I think you'll do a great job sort of game to an LDS Miller Park I Will be there after the show\nAmong say Hi if you can if you see me wondering the the confines of Miller Park or around there right now we're in the friday foreign to different people from different walks of life Corey Peterson Tracey Johnston education Wisconsin there's a lot of different opinions or\nJust to watch TV studios waivers on one side of Scott Walker Governor Scott Walker and the other what should we believe in education course well\nI I think that education are the biggest thing that both sides are doing wrong is the funding is I think a lot of what needs to change it a point where where to that point of diminishing marginal returns with the amount of money we throw at education and so I think a Walker increase in funding for education\nAnd then of course even the Democrats I I think both sides are wrong to do that I think what we need to be changing and how we educate kids and so I I think it's essential ... I mean at that point they really they throw more and more money and nothing nothing changing the kids aren't getting that aren't aren't being better educated a lot of it and selling to\nTeach your benefits um which certainly don't need to be expanded a side I think we just need to just think Scott Walker um either Republicans you care a lot more about I'm not just getting money to the schools that caring about what's actually happening in the schools and how the kids are being\nTaught there's a great point because it it it is the this narrow focus on the amount of money to mhm devoted to education has been less so\nUm the actual basic tenants of education the the the math or science so it seems like we've lost track of that in this in this mission to expand the choices for kids maybe it's not so much of a choice maybe it's just look back to base\nAnd if you look at the numbers I mean we are absolutely right in the middle we are we're both candidates are touting the success in education which is\n... is ... we're rank like twenty three and twenty second in every category in the nation and then let's just not look at the entire world here because we're like fifteenth place our education system\nIn every category in the nation and then let's just not look at the entire world here because we're like fifteenth place our education system\nNeeds some work and that is the opportunity I think for both candidates what are you going to do in this next term Governor Walker what are you going to do Tony ... you've had the ability to to do more and and take advantage of that opportunity as far as it stopped walk her the education governor\nUm I think his messaging should be more about the job creation because he is the job stopping her and I don't think you can be all things to all people because you eat this this education battle is won that can't be one\nHas you know as a Governor Walker been tough enough on Tony ... in this and that was a specific part of this race and education that's the guy in charge of the department public construction has he been tough enough on TALK on ...\nI think he I think he has been very tough in ... he could stand to be tougher I think he also should be tough on the legislators I think that they're the ones making a law ... law as well Tony Evers was an executive position he wasn't the ones writing in passing laws\nI Want to go back to school choice for a second because I think what school choices actually showed us is that for we can get better education for lack of funding because that's a lot of the charter schools a lot of the\nUm the Milwaukee parental choice program has shown us that\nFor a few more dollars in the classroom kids can improve their scores and do a lot better and better test result right\nWell and how great what if the if our school superintendent and our governor could work together to create these solutions I mean that's the thing nonpartisan position that the the position of superintendent but it's so political and it's been so politicized I just think of of that world where\nYou could have both people working together to to create those outcomes for the kids right right\nTrish who jumps record producer and joining me on the friday foreign let's shift to the hop [noise] I don't care who goes first explained to me how this thing is going to work how it's going to deal with our Wisconsin's winter is how it's going to make sense for anybody who's of those people will want a free ride from one specific spot to another well\nI think to answer a lot of those specific questions there there are some people at the city and the ... that can that can answer that question so opening on November second we just had that that announcement or the other day and I and I've had the opportunity to meet those people we've taken a group of of our members I work with commercial realtors\nTo talk to Daryl Simpson who is is that the national consultants who is helping to implement this people like like Jeff Polanski damn\nCaffeine over at the city who who can answer those questions and ah you know working with the real estate community the mayor came out just this week and said that real estate values have increased like twenty eight percent by um I\nI think the way that they came to those numbers we I I don't exactly know what I Will say is that as\nA people are looking at locating downtown they asked how close are we to the streetcar there is a demand for that and there is demand for for being around that permanent infrastructure and when it comes to extending to the arena or they talk about Miller Park or or other places\nWe're trying to get that funding to to do that\nBut you can't do that unless you've got that that corner and that face the mayor acknowledges that it's it's not popular that is his first line in every four is having fun with it now you have to end and it's here that's the thing is this here\nAnd I'm not saying that I think it was the best use of of of funding but it's it's what we had to do and I think we need to to adapt to it and we need to embrace it\nAll right Corey jumping on the hop anytime soon\nI I'm really not a fan of the hot fees and certain part of it it's just the fact that it's two and a half miles of track and that's not from one end to the other either like it's like little spider with all these branches kind of coming out of that and it doesn't go to any of the you know it makes sense if it went to like to university campuses and went to their part um if it went to like third war into Brady street things like that\nBut that's not what it is so it's not it's not going to be solving problems of like people driving while they're drawing ... third word or wherever they're going it's not going to be helping the college kids with no cars get places and it doesn't go to like really the poor neighborhoods either so I'm Wondering what exactly is what kind of gap that they're trying to fail\nWell I think we we need to so so I also live downtown for Twenty years and I work right in the heart of the city Twenty years ago there were tumble read literally down every street in downtown Milwaukee after six PM now we have density which is what we want and half congestion which is what we wanted to people in the suburbs that are listening that don't understand that\nCome and check it out it is it is a much more vibrant place to be and it feels much more like\nA a more metropolitan place and again the hottest controversial and it it's always going to be controversial but it's here so what are we going to do about it to sit around and complain about it is that a realistic thing to expand\nIt makes you a rare bird because of conservative who supports the hospital's not a lot of those people jumping around\nWell I didn't say I supported the author I said I Know it's here and how do we get our head around that and make the best that 'cause I Can't wrap up the tracks right now\nThat we can do that's that's already employees Tracey Johnston court Peterson tutor for people from all walks of life that's the friday before and after the break what are you know that we don't know that's all coming up next right here on WGM measure\nForty joined today on the front of a former Corey Peterson writer researcher for those shows too for liberty Tracey\nJohnston CEO her W also frequent feeling host of mine on WGM or in court you can go first what do you know that we don't know\nWell according to a very recent breaking at Brookings Institute study for the first time in human history the majority of the world is middle class\nAnd when you say no that's not to find in American terms they they have for a while in studying on a different class structure and structures in the world based on the poor they separate afford classes so poor vulnerable a middle class and rich and for the first time in the middle class has a large\nSo that's good to more people are moving up from the poor and vulnerable\nHas gotten isn't very good and it's when it's best looking like a highly and sunny here it was wrecking highlights is that this is going to be very good for consumption a global consumption and for driving the economy\nAnd ...\nAnd so somebody has a little different um so I'm going to take this opportunity to give a shout out so ah we live in a town with a lot of brewers fan for many of whom are probably rolling out of bed right about now [noise]\nUm there's a very special brewers fan that I Want to recognize and she's probably the biggest brewers fan in town and that is my grandma Carol and it's her birthday tomorrow and she's celebrating a big birthday she is the season ticket holder she goes to to all the games she went to spring training up until just a few years ago which is that's that's a major\nUm and I called her this morning to talk about the wind and you know I I think she could explain the whole pitching thing and the the money bought the thing to me she is ah quite the ... and it's her birthday amount so\nI really hope that the birds can deliver when then a cup or have a great birthday\nRose you'll find on a few hours grammar Carol ... members fan so that that's cool I talked about my mom the other\nDay actually this morning as well she's she's also the\nConsummate brewers fan and has either watch or listen to every game is yours ministry calls me up with James is on yesterday's yells at a heart attack and the nicer than as as ... I Want to ... you know just your thoughts on it\nThe four biggest stores as we see it across Milwaukee the state in the world more brewers forty of course\nKavanaugh store that's going to be big us but we hope to have to live coverage are beginning about nine thirty briefly on there to cloture votes that will move back down to a final vote in front of the U.S Senate those senators will make that decision probably is released tomorrow or the president was in Minnesota last night was some audio from that's\nA rally he was commenting on the cabinet hearings and a word that the storyline is going to bring that about ten thirty five at nine thirty five sons rock we can get to the program is gonna joined me were bring counting on on friday now nine thirty five just kind of some of the week for conservative\nWhat's the big storylines are where we're going um use the guy that uh everybody's familiar with the WGM Jay smart guy\nWe're going to break down the stories of the week as we are going to ramp up a very uh news filled tense in some ways Salvatore because brewers ... as I used to take care of business in game one and I know seven\nCould you pass the citizenship test\nNew study says only one third of Americans could do that and I and my show knows I put and we wonder why we're at where we're at ... says the history of the country they live in\nAnd how those two things matter when you're talking about current events and and surprise surprise we get to the current situation in our country with politics and culture in a which shouldn't be that surprising given that we don't know our history at all\nBut we're going to spend some time in the next few minutes talking about the the cabinet nomination I'm actually after the break I'm going to read from an op ed that justice Brett Kavanaugh red or wrote yesterday in the wall Street Journal\nAnd there was a response to all the things in a rural since his testimony last Thursday at that hearing Christie bugging Ford testify first than Brett ... Kevin I responded then of course the treatments and the coverage of that uh the testimony\nThat's the five first than Brett Kavanaugh responded then of course the treatments and the coverage of that uh the testimony was one that suggested he was unable to control his emotions you had anger\nAnd I'll ask the simple question now I Will read extensively reformers out there but I asked a simple question what would you do in a similar situation\nIf your family your children yourself and your career were threatened would you not react the way Brett Kavanaugh reacted I think a lot of us\nFor a lot of us the answer would be yes but I'm going to read extensively from his op ed in the wall Street Journal that was published yesterday\nJust got to get a sense of where Brett Kavanaugh is in this debate now roughly a week away from his testimony the second round of testimony in the ah Supreme Court nomination process and now the Senate poised today to move that both to a final vote tomorrow in front of it for US Senate\nWill do a lot more of this morning on where that story line goes more decks right here in GM's you\nKnow one of those great for twenty highlights that's regular season now we are course in the postseason big win last night game one an LDS thanks to the folks who came down to our watch party at Turner hall how to fund meeting all those folks incredible crowd at Miller Park I'm going to be out there this afternoon I haven't been to a\nPlayoff game uh for the Milwaukee Brewers are all the other opportunities that they've had I haven't been able to go and today I Will be out there for the first time I cannot wait to be out of member park with all the fans\nLooking forward to that they sign a level of the brewers throughout the show today um some highlights a kind of a compilation of all the great audio we heard yesterday on our airwaves and other places related to that big win over the uh\nThe visiting team at the Miller Park or the Rockies or it's like well they came back in the knife any I didn't look good the Jeffries was struggling in uh somehow they got it um the uh the bullpen game that strategy\nJak pressure I should say and I said Jeffries Jeffress um the um the bullpen committee game seemed to work well and I I was listening about you as a broadcasting he was talking about that is that the future face of baseball they won't be starting pitchers relief pitchers will just be pitchers\nAnd uh you know we've seen that the amount of time that the pitchers pets used to be guys have complete games there used to be I used to be a big fat and baseball and make it slowly got whittled away now five innings gets you to when we see less and less of that every year so baseball's changing\nThankfully this year it's changing in a good way for the Milwaukee franchise lots of excitement here in Milwaukee will will bring a lot of that to you today a W teams they also just a a show now he's a broadcasting legit and I'm off the treasure he's Mr baseball ... he joins Jeff Wagner\nLater today at twelve tend to talk about the brewers in the playoffs Jeff um [noise]\nHe's a he's not just a broadcaster Jeff loves his market per season ticket holder and he had to be excited about that game yesterday as well I Want to shift gear to politics today is is one of the big days than the U.S Senate\nThe or the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is down to a few senators now as many or as little as five I should say uh I just I just saw this on Twitter Ben Sasse says she will now votes\nTo confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh so that's a yes vote and there's a few others Joe Manchin says he will decide at nine thirty our time ten thirty Washington D. C. D. C. time when he comes into the chamber a there's a few others as well Murkowski Senator Murkowski from Alaska Senator Collins\nAnd that's really where it lives were they swayed by this additional FBI investigation\nOr the seventh of Brett Kavanaugh as I told you last week none of the charade of comments that were made last week about giving the FBI chance to do additional work to that this candidate ... are going to make any difference to Democrats\nAre the only Democrat that potentially could vote for Brett Kavanaugh's Joe mansion that's because it's actually has to politically\nDoesn't mean it's going to vote yes but the end his state's of West Virginia\nA no vote on Kavanaugh would probably mean the end of his career and ah I saw that a\nCenter to hike camp or recently said you as as recently as yesterday that she was a no vote and that was another one of those states that uh could shift as well so lots of tension in Washington DC I wanted to read from you it's it's probably\nOne of those unconventional\nThings that a Supreme Court nominee has ever done I think it's unique to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd as as those of us watch the testimony last week\nHis response to Christie ... testimony was unique and unconventional he was emotional he cried at times shouted at times called out\nThe Democratic senators on that Judiciary Committee and I said that and I say no I had no problem with the way reacted what would you do if your family\nYour self your children your career were threatened in the manner that he was threatened now we can argue and we do\nBack and forth about if you went too far well he addressed that in in an op ed that he wrote for the wall Street Journal last night and I read some of it and then after the break open up the phone lines as well the African Americans talking touch lines for one for seven nine nine wants his twenty do you think he will be confirmed simple question\nThis is Brett Kavanaugh it in the wall Street Journal\nDuring the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participate in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings after my initial hearing conclude as as I was subject to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculous at least distorted my wife and daughters have faced violent violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service my hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nAs because I forcefully impassioned denied the allegations against me at at times my testimony both of my opening statement and my response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration of being wrongly accused without preparation\nOf horrible conduct completely contrary to my record and character my statement an answers also reflected my deep distress have the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\nI was a very emotional last Thursday more so than I ever been I might have been true emotional at times I let my tone was sharp and I sent a few things that should not have said\nI Hope I ruined the can understand that that was there was a son husband and dad I testify to with five people foremost in my mind my mom my dad my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count I mean the same kind of judge in person I had been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hard working even keel open minded independence and dedicated to the constitution the public good as a judge I always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect\nI've known for my I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed I Will continue to do the same kind of judge I've been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach\nVolunteer and teacher every day I Will try to be the best husband bad in front of the can be our main optimistic on the sunrise side of the mountain that continue to see that day is coming not the day that has gone that's from Brett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh nominated to the U.S Supreme Court's\nHe's just a guy that's in that position\nIt could have been one of twenty five other people whoever would have been put forward by this president whoever was on his list as a conservative justice\nSimilar activities similar charges would have been drummed up now it's been a lot of time of yesterday show talking about this timeline and the fact of the story the fact that a woman came forward Christine Blasey Ford and was outed\nBy either a democratic senator or their staff clearly that's the case the fact that they they waited because they have this information on July ... two weeks ago to present this information to the other senators in the Judiciary Committee\nKnowing full well what what do the process to try to blow it up what do we see happening now as this process seems to have been moved forward I haven't got to the FBI part of it yeah mass protests\nAgain not about Brett Kavanaugh about this president's being allowed to pick a justice for the Supreme Court that's what this is about all the other stuff window dressing unfortunately two people justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAll the other stuff window dressing unfortunately two people justice Brett Kavanaugh Christine Blasey Ford they get trashed in the process but it would have been to other people because that's what Democrats wanted to do here\nAnd you can say I'm hyper partisan and I'm not being fair to Democrats those are the facts\nElections have consequences if Hillary Clinton or presidents she would have selected a very liberal justice for the U.S Supreme Court's\nThat's shouldn't shock anybody shouldn't surprise you that's the reality so don't be surprised about what's happening in Washington DC and the senators at least those voting in favor of Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be intimidated by thugs\n\nAnd threatened and threats from people who really have no knowledge of history no understanding of that's not how this process should work it's been taken over by a few networks and if you writers who want to characterize this process this way but that's not how it's supposed to work\nThe simple fact is the FBI did its job they've added the candidates Democrats didn't like it they complain about the process to complain about the votes to complain about the justice nothing is going to change that\nElections have consequences this president pick a conservative justice that's the reality we'll find out a lot today an early tomorrow on where the story goes but as I sit here right now\nIt seems more and more likely to justice Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed by the U.S Senate the vote will be close no doubt\n\nAfter the break I went to a little bit more about polarization where the country's going I just talked about citizenship and the testing that shows we don't know most people don't know what they're talking about when it comes to politics or our country's history is it any surprise that we get what we get so used to be with you on this Friday right here on WGM jak nine\nThe one degrees at Radio City I just gave you the results of a citizen citizenship test survey\nDone by the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation [noise] also talking about polarization I was on my radar yesterday but I didn't get a chance to do it because of all the brewers\nStuff but surprise surprise polarization between parties is getting worse in this country and in between citizens of this country so Michigan State university did a study\nThat might actually Neal associate professor of psychology and global urban studies looking at how parties the political parties worked together or not work together and ah\nWhat is it shows is that and these are his words polarization have been selling getting worse since early Nineteen seventies\nIncreasingly worse in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd wasn't this this survey wasn't support or to um provide blame or to point blame in any direction\nYou said that it will in the survey regardless of the part that holds the majority in Congress the political divide has widened regardless so there's two kinds of polarization week\nWhen the party simply don't work together don't get along and then strong polarization when one party shot in the other side and how do you know when they when that's happening when you see votes that are just strictly by partisan\nMy party all members\nOr virtually all members vote against whatever the other party is propose policy decisions\nAlso portrayed in the attacks on a party so they have in our situation Democratic senators attacking Brett Kavanaugh Republican senators praising Brett Kavanaugh in a non partisan way that would play out based on\nThe facts of the case not the the party affiliation or who who appointed the judge and you can look you don't look any farther than Mitch McConnell the leader of the Senate majority leader and minority leader Chuck Schumer and the Schumer\nNo report with each other\nThey call each other colleagues looked at as ... every other way they launch personal attacks at each other\n\nAnd one wonders and as a result of the survey where this goes\n\nWrapping up in the seventies a bathing a bit in the eighties ramping back up in the nineties and now here we are today where the two parties literally cannot agree on anything and because of several rule changes and procedural changes within the Senate's\nWe could be facing policy decisions have constantly flip back and forth based on who wins the Senate or the house strictly on party not on policy or what's right for the American public\nIf you think about these things partisan\nPlayers candidates you mean guys like me to talk about politics point of view is fine you can have a point of view you can you can belong to a political party but we're that ceases to be\nUseful is one that's your sole motivation for doing anything because it takes away your ability to assess what actually can work blind obedience receive the state level as well\nOn both sides Republican and Democrat blind obedience gives you weak policy or no policy therefore critical problems facing the state the country don't get fixed don't get resolved and forever is doing this wasteland of media\nAnd partisan politics and that's really kinda wherever ass so shouldn't surprise anybody I started this half hour telling you that people can it don't even understand basic civics history of this country one in three\nCan pass the citizenship test that every US citizen as required to pass as the final step before they're sworn in as citizen\nYou think about this process it should be basic\nFacts that you hold onto it was a U.S citizen that help you make your decisions when it comes to politics and party and all the things that swirl around us every day\nIt's not going to get any better\nOne of the actors are says from the two six to and I gotta go to break after that I was honored about thirty year you're going to be a sponsor for an elderly gal whose family escaped from East Germany when she was going through the U.S citizenship processor questions wrong governing process related she passed it was so proud that makes me teary eyed just thinking about it I was so proud for\nHer you know that's the story you'd like to hear and frankly the fact that\nYoung people\nMiddle aged people even some elderly people can't pass the basic citizenship tests you scare the heck out of all of us more next right here in to a gym Jay in a couple of developers who stand to make some money almost nobody thinks is a good idea to put a thirty story high rise out in bayside you think it's a good idea Jeff picture called at\nOne time this afternoon but here in WGM jaycees pretty with you on this Friday every Friday every everybody nine twenty eight before we get the news a couple of Texas commenting on on the current state of affairs the cabinet nomination I get the ... Merrick\nGarland argument but if you listen to the show you understand that I was one of those conservative Republicans who said they actually should have given him a hearing because not doing that contributes to the problem we have right now everything has consequences actions are in that case inaction have consequences and\nOne thing elected officials do have a good memory they remember what what has been done to them before and they hold grudges\nProbably not the best way to do business but that's how it works so Republicans are paying a price in some sense based on that inaction on rock Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland at least he should have got a hearing\nYou wouldn't have been confirmed probably buddy you deserve to hearing because presidents have a right to pick Supreme Court judges\nAnd this process is so diluted and so messed up by politics I'm not sure it's going to recover anytime soon\nAnd the reason I pointed out the statistics on citizenship and polarization is that's driving much of this not just about the elected officials about the public as well so lots of talk about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "05"}
