said history\nThat that that is what I think you're doing an earlier caller said a lot of history has been whitewashed which by the way I Do not disagree\nBecause I mean and the answer to that whitewashing is more whitewashing\nA another texture this is simply another version of the mob shutting down thoughts they're intolerant up no critical thinking haired or creativity these works of

have been ... and the students who are the mouth that word\nFeelings about the word and what they would like to see happen in their community to bring unity\nIt's about that have you're not skin color the website information prior to the production because of an added the importance of the students talking about this lesson\nI mentioned this earlier but I Will say it again that's really the irony here\nThe purpose to things the purpose and what was accomplished by Harper Lee writing this book\nIt was to expose using Nineteen thirties for example she wrote it in Nineteen sixty imagine what would have happened\nIf she attempted to make it contemporary to the salad\nI don't think you'd ever would have gotten published\nAnd she was however using even then a historical and remember it's not

heavily\nIn some areas of our culture so it's never going to go way\nBut in terms of because something in historical context contain something that's offensive today ... why do open that door Chris how far do you go in saying wow\nThis offends people\nSo we can't put this on anymore this play includes this or this play includes that\nThere were people at the example I gave earlier I'm I'm One of them and I'm not a huge fan of the president but I Am one who said the production of Julius Caesar that had a Donald Trump local like in a business suit stabbed\nWas deeply offensive to me and I actually thought it was dangerous\nHowever I think I parted ways with some other conservative talk shows or I did not call for the production it'd be shut down\nIt's just a dangerous door to open even a crack and let's be honest it's been open more than a crack and as many callers pointed out\nThat the problem and Chris is okay you say don't show does but then there are people who are offended by other things it is I Know it sounds like the slippery slope the problem is we are on that slippery slope and and we have seen it\nAnd the reality is if you're on comfortable with you know you learn words going to use it you're uncomfortable you have the right not to do that or TV shows that I have stopped watching because quite frankly I think they just darken my soul\nWant Netflix to ban them or eliminate them\nI don't feel that way about it\nI Choose not to watch\nThose who are offended\nCan choose not\nTo participate\nAnd unfortunately however that strategy has been one sided over the

Bush rock Obama and Donald Trump\nShe considers qualifications that party she reviewed Brett Kavanaugh's twelve your judicial record including more than three hundred opinions speeches and law review articles she met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours and spoke with him again for an hour by phone with more questions\nShe judge Tim centrist in his views and well within the mainstream of judicial thought\nHe believes he told her the idea of precedent is not only a practice of tradition but I tend to rooted in the constitution\nAs dumb as Ford's charges since the confirmation process without a trial the rules are more elastic but certain fundamentally legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence in fairness you there on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nAnd we must always remember she wrote that it was when passions are most in the plane that fairness is most in jeopardy\nThat with Susan Collins Peggy Noonan rights she calls with a gang rape charge an outlandish allegations of no credible evidence at this point that was understood the Democrats are going to fire heat is believable said ms Collins than ms forward is a survivor of sexual assault and that's the trauma has offended her life\nBut before with this issue name could corroborate her account none at any recollection of the party her lifelong friend said under penalty of felony that she never remember such an event or even knows Brett Kavanaugh\nMs Collins is that she's been alarmed and disturbed by those who suggested unless judge Kavanaugh's nomination was rejected the Senate but somehow be condoning sexual assault nothing could be further from the truth\nThe atmosphere surrounding the nomination as them politically charged there reached a fever pitch\nEven before the forward and the other charges\nThat has been challenging to separate fact from fiction but his decision must be made judge Kavanaugh's record has been called one of the exemplary public servant judge teacher coach husband and father for hope is he will work\nOut that he will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we are far fewer five four decisions as the public confidence that our judiciary and our\nCourt is restored and so she said she would vote to confirm it was a master class of what a friend called old south or on this combined with the feeling for justice or word on the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic party\nFor Halloween and screeching that interrupted the hearings in the voting for people who call them the door of the court the ones who the senators to the halls and screamed at them in elevators who survived it and harassed one at dinner with his wife\nWho disrupted and brought an air of chaos who attempted to Fort democratic process is so that the people could not listen they make their judgments\nYou know how that sounded to normal people Republicans and Democrats and unaffiliated that sounded demonic\nIt didn't sound like the resistance or has taken me to it sounded like the shrinking in the background of an old audiotape of the ...\nDemocratic leaders should stand up to the screeners they haven't because they're afraid of them but things like this spreading deep and stand up to your base it's leading nowhere good and you know it Peggy Noonan the wall Street Journal I have some additional thoughts on this [noise]\nI mean she characterizes perfectly the way Democrats overplay their hand\nHave no credibility in dealing with the forward issue on two fronts one they made it clear they were never tolerate a justice capital\nFor completely\nBeing valid reasons\nAnd unjust reasons we don't like the way he's going to rule\nSo they have zero credibility\nWhen a legitimate issue came up\nAnd I agree with that you knew that you can believe something happened\nI also quite frankly do have issues with some of justice Kavanaugh's testimony she clearly is not comfortable with his team history of drinking\nAnd I do not believe he was honest about it\nBut Peggy Noonan point is a valid one\nDr Ford name for witnesses\nKnown corroborated\nI actually also though I Will make the case [noise]\nI think there could have been more investigating done\nI understand the Democrats would happen to go on forever I get that\nBut I actually there were people that could have been spoken to\nBut in the in the system works for thousands\nAnd this notion that Hillary Clinton and\nEric Holder or basically\nGiving their blessing to the ... type of behavior that Peggy Noonan is cursing\nOr criticizing the cursing per se but criticizing and they do so at their own peril\nThe brewers are certainly the hottest team a more modest or the Dodgers that you know they did with attitude down the stretch as well but the ... of course one of those Lebanon row since you know through the play offs a sweeping the Rockies but what they are talking about is\nWhen you look at the statistics you would think the Dodgers would have somewhere between a hundred and five and a hundred and ten wins I'm completely serious about that they don't they got Ninety two is what they finished the regular season live and they of course have to go through the tie breaker as well in fact\nThey led the national league\nIn most runs scored and fewer ... runs allowed\nSo ... what is called is the one differential the number of runs scored versus a number of runs that allowed one hundred Ninety four the brewers one differential Ninety five\nWhich is actually a lot healthier there was even late in the season that was in the mid thirties rivers so they you know\nYou were seen that improvement down the stairs which made sense with that but the hot streak that they have but they're still not really haven't been scoring machine and [laughter] without bullpen it didn't really matter I never got timely hits\nYell at you for all the MVP thought\nThat the timeliness of his hits or you know as much as the statistics themselves so this is a pretty classic match up you have a red hot team which\nWhen you look at statistically the Dodgers did they didn't turn out the whims that they should have turned out with the office of production and the pitching that they got\nSo it makes it\nA really\nMatch up\nNow I producer Jordan I ever talking a couple of minutes we were both optimistic\nSometimes ... it is getting hot at the right time and it doesn't matter the sport\nYou saw that with the twenty ten Packers and they just they were actually the Superbowl favorites really in that year then they didn't look anything like it in the middle of the season and got hot when it mattered ... just got into the playoffs and then the defense really played well\nWhat you would you know you look at even against the Rockies\nWatson squandered opportunities I mean really live side or the run differential I I don't know you know as a season stranded on base I I don't know what their numbers are but boy you sure saw that in the Rockies series and I don't think that will get it done\n[noise] I don't know why would do something so silliest to predict this\nBut I think they are going to be Clinton Russia\nI just I I don't know\nIt just has that twenty ten Packer feels to me I could be totally totally all went on a speaking speaking of the Packers in a couple of minutes I Want to talk about that\nWho's number one in the hearts of sports fans are another word we got a lot of news these stuff including who's the real education governor\nOr the short story that I mentioned and a lot more\nBut we'll just meant a few minutes on that coming up and then we'll get to is the real education having her eight forty news radio double duty and Jay Z and Jay radio presents a hometown gala Turner all on Monday the\nFree yes free event will feature a massive movie screen broadcasts I've turned our whole ballroom game three the unhealthy ask between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Dodgers\nSink to the voice you just heard hall of famer Bob ... play by play broadcast on WGM Jay radio and the associated face for radio network\nA bad that was free nothing wrong with the radio completely free that's what I said doors open at five thirty\nWhich leads me to this I won't be there I'll be at limbo field\nAnd I got to tell him I mean\nYou know obviously that's getting three\nI I couldn't attend to even if I take it because I Need a plane ticket as well but\nBetween that and I am as die hard a Packers fan as you'll find I don't live far from ... up in Green Bay\nRight now and I'm sure it's part of it because of the Packers underperforming I Am totally just\nInto the brewers way more than the Packers and my thought was\nWhen uh the folks here when we got this information to share about the event that turned her home I thought as where would I rather be\nAll come on you'd rather be at land or feel well\nLet me say this you know what my first thought when I I actually this is true I forgot that I I was going to doctors game and when I remembered that I'm thinking\nWell I Hope they're going to show to score the brewers score\nThat land both feel I Would think that they would\nEmphasize they have really upped the wife ... and my phone works very well there are now\nSo I you know I can keep the score and that way\nBut I\nI Will tell you living in northern Wisconsin and I mentioned this on the air earlier this week\nThe you know in Milwaukee here in Milwaukee you ... you know yes everyone is brewers crazier most everyone as\nYou would really do you have to get out state to get the sense I I remember twenty eleven\n... and I and I just think this is much bigger than that\nIn terms of the way the\nFan base out states as I call it ... north as it's affectionately call this is really dialed in\nAll right I actually restrain myself and take a break from talking about the Milwaukee Brewers because\nThe interesting piece in today's Wall Street journal actually Craig Gilbert Molly back in the journal sentinel posted a story but it posted early this morning education is the one issue both Scott Walker and Tony ears are hitting hard in campaign ads and the point of the story is that\nUh it's the only issue there are a number of other issues\nWant us talking about the other is talking about education\nIs the one they're both him right now Governor Scott Walker apparently sensing early on totally ... superintendent of department of public instruction was going to win the primary walkers hey I'm the I'm the education governor\nAnd that drew scorn and ridicule from the left oh now he's Mr education governor after getting this and getting that and so on and of course\n... wants to stay claimed that he would be the education of under because of his\nLife long adult lifelong education background\nA couple of weeks ago I had the chance to interview Governor Walker and I asked him I said Democrats are trying to make this a death bed if you will conversion on your part that now suddenly because you're in a very competitive reelection bed now if you're the education governor and she made he said look\nI became an education governor when ... got done\nAnd that I made you say that to anyone who doesn't like the governor doesn't agree with his politics or anyone on the left or educate outcome on\nThat doesn't make you the education governor in fact that's how you damaged education and now you want to be the education of it are and and the governor makes it very clear no\nAccent makes me the education governor because of its success there is a piece in today's Wall Street journal that builds on that and I want to share of it is very long\nGovernor Scott Walker's collective bargaining reforms that say Wisconsin from becoming a fiscal basket case like Illinois and a new study suggests they are improving student learning\nLearning to the governor's biggest achievement in eight years in office has been curbing the power of government unions by limiting collective bargaining to wages of requiring public employees to contribute more to their pensions and health care superintendents that also attract better teachers by paying for performance\nMary Bell presidents of the Wisconsin Education Association council teachers' union declared at the time that Mr Walker has taken an extra public schools I mean to interrupt and briefly they still they still say that\nAnd that's the reforms would result in the destruction of public service at public education in this state\nThe public schools in student performance are better now because of reforms according to a new study by the Wisconsin Institute prolonged liberty and you may have heard about this it was pretty good talk radio fodder when will released it\nThe study examined state math scores before and after the reforms were implemented reading scores were considered because the state change language arts staff after the reforms took effect ... you know the methodology they use\nMath proficiency increase by an average just to point one percent across school district after districts implemented the reforms improvements were found in the states small town rural and suburban districts but curiously\nScores an urban schools didn't budge\nOne of the reason may be that administrators in Madison and Milwaukee resisted the reforms that may not have taken advantage of their new powers this theory is supported by a study last year by Yale economist Barbara ... that found high quality teachers that is those who improve the students learning most\nWe go first to a longtime listener of my showing my former radio incarnation sham it a little boy and a Happy Friday my friend\nAre happy right my friend do you do it's always good to hear your when you get a canned food director talents on the air or the ... the\nUm my current events this um what's the what do you think if he had done I don't want forward for the production and hurt a fan of type that I've known for example some school districts will fill a review and and read a\nMark Twain's classic hardly yeah Huck Finn and of course if you know one of the characters that that become friends with as a black man\nWho happens to be a flavor with is referred to as an word gym in in the context of it but they but they will release today refer to them as we grow Jim\n... and it doesn't seem to lose its edge in terms of the context of the plane the main or does the points they'll get across cleaned up a little bit and would that be the case here and kill a mocking bird\nSee and that's that really use the sixty four thousand dollar question isn't intend to let me go back to the statements now this is a statement they put on the Web site before the controversy about that a\nShoot accurately and honestly completes the narratives I think in this case and I and I don't know about Twain but I think in this case Tam\nYou fire attempting to sanitize and you're diluting the whole point that hurt through we I think was making at the time people used to use that word freely that was wrong\nYou can use this as a teaching experienced look this is the way it was back then and I think you run into a serious danger almost erasing history by trying to make it more palatable\nAt night and I agree with that and if you were talking I was thinking of another point positively with us who if I if I could bring this up of all my friends in West side what happened late you know Washington physically\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and everything else and the protest to the Republican managed to hold their ground on on a good principle the principle of due process and I'm Wondering if\nHarbor leaf book to going mocking bird also doesn't raise that question as well too because unfortunately we if we know the story who he is connected not because of anything\nThat the crime shows but because he eventually says that understanding you with a black man that felt sorry for a white woman which was not acceptable at that time and there but there were filled the idea of due process did occur even though the process went wrong\nI kind of wander if ... ... and the demands of you if we accused you of something and we don't eat process the accusations enough of that point wouldn't be made it in this story as well through a bigger question\nThat is actually an interesting point and thanks for the call ... you're right it's it's off track but interesting nonetheless to Jeff in Green Bay Jeff you're on WGM jak\nJak factory or Steve I'm Sorry Steve Steve Steve hey no go ahead Steve but\nTrying to shape oh Jerry I'm here\nTo go ahead what's your name your screener\nWhy do we try to change which I mean that was part of our history I think that\nThe premise of your story ... printing it shows ... you have to deal with it\nYou look at the culture today with kids and I can\nProbably [noise] where did you why didn't\nYou know we can't keep changing their history you have to learn history\nFucking that's what ... ... at sea thanks for the call and boy what an excellent point how can you learn from history\nIf you whitewash it if you try to make it go away you can't learn from it I absolutely do not think here's here's my take on this\nI think the word needs to be there\nAnd I think at least internally they explained very well why it has become virtually the only word in English language that can never under any contacts be spoken\nExcept by African American entertainers\nI think if I think you do lose something\nIf you don't include that word\nIn context I think it's it it should have stayed I so here's my position on this they certainly shouldn't have cancelled and I don't think they should have ... threat of protest to have to change the way they planned I'm presenting something because that doors didn't open too wide all ready\nThat's just I I think those are two important principles the academic mortgage talking text line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty if you

J.\nHer damn I'm Sorry odd Dan Walker shocked Dan go ahead\nYou're more in the morning\nI I totally agree with you that it is wrong for the school district to cancel the showing or the showing the production of the kill a mocking bird I think they're being held hostage by the\nCorrect on a protest I Would call it\nProtests terrorists\nOr potential hair is\nI I go a little lighter than that I call it the hecklers needs help\nBut it's it is intimidation you're absolutely right about that damn thanks a lot for the call they were intimidated\nBy protests\nYou know that is\nI wouldn't say terrorism I Believe in St mob rule but it's intimidation\nThis isn't using\nThe N. word in the Georgia is\nIn the way that you think of it in the reason that makes us have to say the N word\nHas that's not what this is the historical concept context is critical\nChris in Janesville Chris go ahead\nI ah I have a unique perspective as far as being a major in college and in doing so I have three years of of theater history um I I think they should have left the as is theater is meant to be\nA in your faith if you'd be uncomfortable if it's the talk about the the things that we don't like to talk about and an educator on where we have been in where we should be\nWhat an excellent point you know what if it's if you're comfortable with it it's probably not all that beneficial the intellectually is it right\n... you know that that is that is such a great point Chris thanks a lot for the call\nStarting to get us out of our comfort zone a little bit\nThings to do that\nAre intellectually important\nAnd I believe that cheating as quickly as they did and boys just hours before the first production this is just I I mean I don't I don't even know what they are so many issues here\nVowing to the hecklers veto the disappointment for the kids I Do agree with this I I you know what the protestors or potential protesters and saying this will we didn't want to cancel we just wanted the word emitted\nIn other words you wanted to dictate to free speech um authors\nAnd I know you don't see it that way\nThat's what it is to Kurt ... your auntie I'm Jay\n... I'll let you know right off the bat that I'm a progressive and I do agree that this uh with everything that everybody's been saying that the world should have been left in there but earlier in this conversation you made a comment about whitewashing\nOf uh of American history of our history and I would argue our history has already been totally whitewashed\nAnd that's part of the problem because\nUh you know whether it's Native American history or a a you know getting all the information about what some of our phone founding fathers did in particular Thomas Jefferson\nFor someone who's slaves and things like that but you know that that that the schools right to the court is you know who who gets to dictate who says what and what was presented to the kids and uh I agree that this this should have never happen\nBut you know our our history has already been white washed and if you look at history books and I'm a historian I run a a a large Historical Society in Wisconsin and I'm with a history major in college archeology major in college and I can tell you that\nIf anybody knows history you'll know that it's already been whitewashed and that's just the points that I wanted to make thank you\nAnd then we don't go anywhere not not not a bad point is you take off her darn it because when I was ... ... because when I was going to ask her is so is the answer more whitewashing though and I and I think that's the problem all us getting drug in here before the news Greg in Watertown urine GM Jay\nThey could have taken the word out they didn't feel that that would be right to do that\nThey could have just you know the heck was that we're going to we're going to do this and we'll be able to protest they could have taken the word out I disagree with that are cancelled my really don't I I certainly don't agree with that\nBut I don't do they fear violent protests and and if so why\nTwo days in the wall but tell us a David Hi you're on him Jay\nA good learning I'm I'm Glad I don't live in ... I I think it's ridiculous to have chemical do when I'm In if you if it's a binary options leaving the word in or here calling them pool of work\nAnd if you look at it it was to kill a mocking bird a classic story um that word to me is a very small part of the story is really about to say this person who they or class sort of a sudden this person is a wreck or very I mean there's lots of ... that could have been used other than the N. word\nAnd and it's especially timely with the care of it on trial I mean to kill a mocking bird is really good exact story that man for the governor here you know so it's it's a classic it's very timely but I think it was ... to hear their canceling three hours before\nYou know grandma to come into town everybody was ready yeah\nThis was a chance for the kids to do a production that they worked most on\nYou know and all that the night you know the name of of succumbing to a hotel so the lesson that was learned is that you know the ... of the protesters enough to completely shut down an operation I think that's a horrible lesson so than the others are just change the word and move forward\nDay thanks a lot for the call I I you know I Know it seems like it's that easy binary choice which let me say that he is absolutely right about the lesson learned from\nA threat of a protest see he could not be more right about that\nBut\n... I Would say I think the lesson of well we're going to change something you don't like of a threat of a protest I is that really any better you know\nThat's the concern to Don in the waters saw Don go ahead\nAnd go on and I aren't we believe that they should not can who played and my take on it is is is that when Harper Lee wrote the book was written as\nIt was written meant to be a time to and to draw attention to the extreme bigotry and prejudice of the times so when people want to protest the ... the dream you know certainly voter but they're offended and the short of that that's why she wrote\nOh isn't that the ultimate irony here Don is that this book is seen as a driving force in advancing the civil rights movement and has now seen as at least an element of it is seen as offensive to the African American community\nThat's exactly my point\nYeah and it's a great one who's saying one of them said\nThat takes a lot for the call and and and where that gets ... that you were that gets lost though is you have to put it in historical context\nAll we're saying I miss I tell you what we're going to take calls probably up to the news and I've got a bunch of tax I I got there was really good tax I've got to share them I'll probably end up doing that a after ten o'clock ... it's a hot topic and they're just an absolute excellent thoughts on\nEven if I don't agree with all of them I think people are making some excellent points and that's what it should be all about\nThe acting that mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine months twenty nine fifty one news

last minute I don't think that with fair I'm Patty\n[laughter] I don't have an answer to that what I Would say is the districts are saying they didn't do a good enough job of getting it out into the community I'm speculating I don't have the answer any perhaps they just recently\nFound out you know maybe maybe they just do I I'm not saying that they were I guess for the right to be around school

able to\nTo get what they're looking for it and try and get what I'm saying\nI Do in fact it's a really good point to any because and let me let me put some words in your mouth is this what you're saying we have an issue if you're going to be offended by us trying to show you the way things used to be\nCorrect yes yes and you know when I mean that's like an art art of theater is about the voting hours on end and the Congress and each one ever in order to get that emotion and got\nThe idea of the time it wouldn't it wouldn't be a factor\nPay me thanks a lot for the call I it it's the same thing is when a movie studios are told don't have people smoking cigarettes in ... when a lot of people smoke cigarettes it's just really doesn't bitch\nAnd look is it necessary for example my wife and I went and saw a star is born boy there was an F bombs all over the place in an otherwise why what a great movie\nBut that you know it it it kind of war on us we do understand we think they overdo it alone but we do understand in the ... you would expect people in those circumstances to say\nJerry into walkie Jerry go at\nPlay a you know what I heard this boats and kill them\nThat actually reminds me that I think there's a wider trend in terms of the PC\nPolice get into your deeply involved in the arts and literature um last couple of years ah they were racing they I'm\nFrom ... to ah create a statue for Ernest Hemingway the literature American literature grade in northern Michigan or because he spent a lot of time there as a youth\nAnd the exact same thing happened where people came out of the woodwork and said\nWell how could he of Maine that's offensive comment and in this state fan than these novels Seventy eighty\nAnd it became quite controversial at one point\nThey weren't going to go forward with the the statue\nAnd here this is one of the giants of American literature a Nobel Prize winner\nA brilliant books like um for whom the bell tolls\nI'm and I'm In and it was a very similar situation and again\nThere's writers these artists are they're writing and realistic man or\nTo capture or what the character is and what the people were like\nA hand

teaching\nPeople a word that they might not have ever known if we can and should we be able to try to be eliminated the use of these words altogether well as other callers have pointed out Chris ... it's\n... it's used heavily in some areas of our culture so it's never going to go way\nBut in terms of because something in historical context contain something that's offensive today hot why'd you open that door Chris how far do you go in saying wow\nThis offends people so we can't put this\nOn anymore this play includes this or this play includes that\nThere were people I've the example I gave earlier\nI'm I'm One of them and I'm not a huge fan of the president but I Am on a new says the production of Julius Caesar that had a Donald Trump local like in a business suit stabbed\nWas deeply offensive to me and I actually thought it was dangerous\nHowever I think I parted ways with some other conservative talk shows or I did not call for the production it'd be shut down\nIt's just a dangerous door to open even a crack I must be honest it's been open more than a crack\nAnd as many callers have pointed out that the problem and Chris is okay you say don't show does but then there are people who are offended by other things it is I Know it sounds like the slippery slope the problem is we are on that slippery slope and and we have seen it\nAnd the reality is if you're on comfortable with you know if you learn words going to use it you're uncomfortable with you have the right not to do that or TV shows that I have stopped watching this quite frankly I think they just darken my soul\nI don't want Netflix to ban them or eliminate them\nI don't feel that way about it\nI Choose not to watch\nThose who are offended can choose not\nTo participate\nAn ... unfortunately

articles she met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours and spoke with him again for an hour by phone with more questions\nShe judge Tim centrist in his views and well within the mainstream of judicial thought\nHe believes he told her the idea of precedent is not only a practice of tradition but tenet rooted in the constitution\nAs dumb as Ford's charges since the confirmation process is not a trial the rules are more elastic but certain fundamentally legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence and therapists do Baron my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nAnd we must always remember she wrote that it was when passions are most inflame the fairness is most in jeopardy\nThat Susan Collins Peggy Noonan rights she calls the gang rape charge an outlandish allegation with no credible evidence at this point that was understood the Democrats have gone too far it is believable said ms Collins them is for is a survivor of sexual assault and that's the trauma has offended her life\nBut the four witnesses she named could corroborate her account nominate any recollection of the party her lifelong friend said under penalty of felony that should either remember such an event or even knows for Kavanaugh\nMs Collins said she'd been alarmed undisturbed by those who suggested unless judge Kavanaugh's nomination was rejected the Senate would somehow be condoning sexual assault nothing could be further from the truth\nThe atmosphere surrounding the nomination has been politically charged they reached a fever pitch even before the forward and the other charges\nAnd has been challenging to separate fact from fiction but his decision must be made judge Kavanaugh's record has been called one of the exemplary public servant judge teacher coach husband and father for hope is he will work\nOut that he worked to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we are far fewer five four decisions and so the public confidence that our judiciary at our highest\nCourt is restored and so she said she would vote to confirm it was a master class and with a friend called old style thrown this combined with the feeling for justice a word the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic party\nFor Halloween and screeching that interrupted the hearings in the voting the people who call of the door of the court the ones who chased senators to the halls and screamed at them in elevators who surrounded and harassed one at dinner with his wife\nWho disrupted and brought an air of chaos who attempted to threaten democratic process is so that the people could not listen and make their judgments\nYou know how that sounded to normal people Republicans and Democrats and unaffiliated at southern demonic\nIt didn't sound like the resistance or has taken me to the satellite the shrieking in the background of an old audiotape of an extra ...\nDemocratic leaders should stand up to the screeners they haven't because they're afraid of them but things like this spreading deep and stand up to your base it's leading you know were good and you know it Peggy Noonan the wall Street Journal I have some additional thoughts on this [noise]\nI mean she characterizes perfectly the way Democrats overplay their hand\nThey have no credibility in dealing with the Ford issue on two fronts one they made it clear they were never tolerate a justice capital\nFor completely\nIn valid reasons\nAnd unjust reasons we don't like the way he's going to rule\nSo they have zero credibility\nWhen a legitimate issue came up\nAnd I agree with Peggy Noonan you can believe something happened\nTo Christine Blasey Ford\nI also quite frankly do have issues with some of justice Kavanaugh's testimony she clearly is not comfortable with this\nTeen history of drinking\nAnd I do not believe he was honest about it\nBut Peggy Noonan point is a valid one\nDr Ford name for witnesses\nKnown corroborated\nI actually also though I Will make the case [noise]\nI think there could have been more investigating done\nI understand the Democrats have had to go on forever I get that\nBut I actually there were people that could have been spoken to\nIn the and the system works for a dozen\nAnd this notion that\nHillary Clinton and\nEric Holder or basically\nGiving the blessing to the ... type of behavior that Peggy Noonan is

I remember twenty eleven\n... and I and I just think this is much bigger than that\nIn terms of the way the\nFan base out states as I call it ... north as it's affectionately call is just really dialed in\nAll right I actually restrain myself and take a break from talking about the Milwaukee Brewers because\nInteresting piece in today's Wall Street journal actually Craig Gilbert Molly back in the journal sentinel posted a story it posted early this morning education is the one issue both Scott Walker and Tony ears are hitting hard in their campaign ads and the point that the story is\nAh it's the only issue there are a number of other issues\nOne is talking about the other is talking about education\nIs the one they're both him right now Governor Scott Walker apparently sensing early on totally ... superintendent of department of public instruction was going to win the primary walkers hey I'm the I'm the education governor\nAnd that drew ... foreign and ridicule from the left oh now she's minister education governor after getting this and getting that and so on and of course\n... wants to stay claim that he would be the education I'm under because of his\nLife long adult lifelong education background\nA couple of weeks ago I had the chance to interview Governor Walker and I asked him I said Democrats are trying to make this a death bed if you will conversion on your part that now suddenly because you're in a very competitive reelection bed now if you're the education governor and she made he said look\nI became an education governor when ... got done\nAnd that I made you say that to anyone who doesn't like the governor doesn't agree with his politics or anyone I'm laughter educate outcome on\nThat doesn't make you the education governor in fact that's how you damaged education and now you want to be the education of it are and and the governor makes it very clear no\nAccent makes me the education governor because of its success there is a piece in today's Wall Street journal that builds on that and I'm On a shirt but he was very long\nGovernor Scott Walker's collective bargaining reforms that say Wisconsin from becoming a fiscal basket case like Illinois and a new study suggests they are improving student learning to\nThe governor's biggest achievement in eight years in office has been curbing the power of government unions by limiting collective bargaining to wages of requiring public employee\nOr in public employees to contribute more to their pensions and health care superintendents that also attract better teachers by paying for performance Mary Bell president of the Wisconsin Education Association council teachers' union declared at the time\nThat Mr Walker has taken an extra public schools let me interrupt and briefly they still they still say that\nAnd other reforms would result in the destruction of public service and public education in this state\nOf public schools in student performance are better now because of reforms according to a new study by the Wisconsin Institute for a long liberty and you may have heard about this it was pretty good talk radio fodder when we'll released it\nThe study examine state math scores before and after the reforms were implemented reading scores were considered because the state change language arts staff after the reforms took effect ... just a you know the methodology they use\nMath proficiency increased by an average of two point one percent across school district after districts implemented the reforms improvements were found that the state's small town rural and suburban districts but curiously\nScores in urban schools didn't budge\nOne of the reason may be that administrators in Madison and Milwaukee resisted the reforms that may not have taken advantage of their new powers this theory is supported by a study last year by Yale economist Barbara ... that found high quality teachers that is those who improves students learning most\nTended to move to districts teachers could negotiate their pay well poor performing teachers stuck to regimented salaries said superintendent Tony ... of the Democratic candidate for governor against Mr Walker\nHis pledge to roll back Walker's collective bargaining reforms that end of our program that helps twenty thousand low income students attend private school in Milwaukee\nHe also wants to raise taxes on the wealthy manufacturers and farmers to juice spending for public schools no matter their performance Mr Walker's reforms have saved the states the state billions of dollars and\nReduce property taxes they're Democrats take control of the state house in November they'll attempt to reverse this progress\nAnd give unions the run of Madison again today's Wall Street journal and that is that is where the rubber meets the road here\nThe doom and gloom didn't happen you in fact you are seeing improvement in student performance\nAt a more efficient cost\nIsn't that the standard we want to run government as the private sector does sounds that way than me or a couple of minutes I'm On a set up speaking of schools uh topic we're going to get to him at nine o'clock hour eight fifty two news radio that believed the MTA hand that\nMeans the end healthy ass is here ... lived for Mila ... the Dodgers come to town for game on against the curve all of famer Bob you're on the call all pulses along our coverage starts tonight\nAt six thirty five eight fifty five Jerry Vader infer Jeff Wagner I Know but this isn't just that it's all because of the ... okay [noise] so anyway uh after nine o'clock we're going to talk about\nA school related story and there's pretty good chance you've already heard it\nIt is the story about short run high cancelling a schedule production of to kill a mocking bird\nBecause they got word of planned protest because the production would include the N. word\nJust reading a little bit here from the journal sentinels coverage when short with high school chose to kill a mocking bird is this yours animal ballplayers irrelevant commentary on the times based on the Harper Lee plastic up on a white southerner lawyer defending an innocent black man in the thirties\nBut ... book which has been banned by many schools across the country I didn't know that I Know there was proposals to do that remains is controversial today as it did when she wrote it on Thursday just hours before the curtain was to go up ... Hansel the production in response to a planned protest over\nThe use of the N. word in some scenes\nThis does not fall cleanly as the journal sentinel accurately points out between on racial lines\nEverybody is ticked off at this for one reason or another those who were upset about the presence of the worst hey this is what we want is\nWe just we just wanted the word omitted you didn't have to cancel the production and then there are those who say the word shouldn't have been omitted\nPrices have been all Jerry I'm here\nTo go ahead what's your told your screener\nWhy do we try to change and that was part of our history I think that\nThe premise of the story the premise that shows prank man can you have to deal with it\nIt looked at the culture today with kids and I can\nProbably ... wherever you go out and\nYou know we can't keep changing our history you have to learn from history\nFucking that's what ... ... S C thanks for the call and boy what an excellent point how can you learn from history if you whitewash it if you try to make it go away you can't learn from it I absolutely do not say here's here's my take on this\nI think the word needs to be there\nAnd I think at least internally they explained very well why\nDid this become virtually the only word is an English language that can never under any contacts be spoken\nExcept by African American entertainers\nI think if I think you do lose something\nIf you don't include that word\nIn context I think it's it it should have stayed I so here's my position on this they certainly shouldn't have cancelled and I don't think they should have vowed to threat of protests to have\nTo change the way they climbed up presenting something because that doors been open too wide all ready that's just\nI I think those are two important principles\nThe acting that mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty if you want to weigh in\nMind funny one news radio W T. M. J. he says you sort of run for reelection in there about three dozen Democrats who want to run against him ... asks is presidents are more popular among Republicans in twenty Eighteen\nThen he was in twenty sixteen Steve shares his thoughts that's all thirty five today we're asking for your thoughts Charlotte Hi cancels the production\nOf to kill a mocking bird because of threats\nTo protest\nAnd one of the discipline and for the kids my wife years years in community theater I I've never I've I Know what it's like to rehearse in rehearsal prepare at home alone nights while she's involved in the show this is just devastating and I think it's just it's it's wrong on so many levels that we've already highlighted\nToday than apples and Dave you're on the M. J.\nHer damn I'm Sorry I stand or walk ... Shaw damn go at\nDuring the morning\nI I totally agree with you that is wrong for the school district to cancel the showing or the showing the production of to kill a mocking bird I think they're being held hostage by the\nCorrect on a protest I Would call it\nProtests terrorists or potential hair is\nI I go a little lighter than that I call it the hecklers veto\nBut it's it is intimidation you're absolutely right about that damn thanks a lot for the call they were intimidated\nBy protests\nYou know that is\nI wouldn't say terrorism I wouldn't even say mob rule but it's intimidation\nAnd we look this isn't using\nThe N. word in the Georgia is\nIn a way that you think of it in ... and the reason that makes us have to say the N word\nThat's that's not what this is the historical context context is critical\nChris in Janesville Chris go ahead\nI uh I have a unique perspective as far as being a major in college and in doing so I have three years of of your history um I I think they should have looked at as is theater is meant to be\nA in your face it meant to be uncomfortable if it's meant to talk about the things that we don't like it talk about and an educator on where we have been in where we should be\nWhat an excellent point either what\nIf it's if you're comfortable with it it's probably not all that beneficial the intellectually is it right\n... you know that's that is that is such a great point Chris thanks a lot for the call ... get us out of our comfort zone a little bit\nToo said do that\nAre are intellectually important\nI Believe the cheating as quickly as they did and boys just hours before the first production is just I I mean I don't I don't even know what the deal there were so many issues here\nVowing to the hecklers veto the disappointment for the kids I Do agree with this I I you know so what's the protesters or potential protesters are saying well we didn't want to cancel we just wanted the word limited\nIn other words you wanted to dictate to free speech of authors\nAnd I know you don't see it that way\nThat's what it is to perks involved with ... ... your auntie I'm Jay\nTaking my call 'em I'll let you know right about that I'm a progressive and I do agree that this uh with everything that everybody's been saying that the word should have been left in there but earlier in this conversation you made a comment about whitewashing\nOf ah of American history of our history and I would argue our history has already been totally whitewashed and that's part of the problem because\nUh you know whether it's Native American history or a a you know getting all the information about what some of our phone founding fathers did in particular Thomas Jefferson\nFor someone who's slaves and things like that but you know that that that the schools right to the core of the issue you know who who gets the dictator who says walked in what was presented to the kids and uh I agree that this this should have never happened\nBut you know our our history has already been whitewashed and if you look at history books and I'm a historian I run a a large Historical Society in Wisconsin and I'm with a history major in college archeology major in college and I can tell you that\nIf anybody knows history you know that it's already been whitewashed and that's just the points that I wanted to make thank you\nAnd said we don't really work not not none of bad point is you take off her darn it because when I was ...\nBecause when I was going to ask Kurt is so is the answer more\nWhitewashing though and I and I think that's the problem all us getting drug in here before the news Greg in Watertown urine GM Jay\nGood morning thank you for taking my call\n... ... a Jew quick point one the old whitewashing thing\nYou can't do that I mean it's just it's not right you got to know what history is or like they've always said you do have to repeat it and you said earlier\nA about only black entertainers are allowed to use that word\nJimmy that becomes a double standard they complain about people using it all that's derogatory over places\nThey're allowed to use it I don't agree with that I think like I said it becomes a double standard\nGreg thanks a lot for the call appreciate it after the news we have someone on the line who says they shouldn't have cancelled it\nAnd of course we'll take your calls as

really mean points for that like make as to why I think unfortunately\nSince court only realistic and wants to cancel the play on the first one being the fact that I think there is a very big difference between underage liners performing like play and saying this word versus that's where I don't know the rap or something else like that I I Would not telling the Democrats and um\nAnd then secondly I'm an or something like that there is also kind of difficult especially for like a white person can't really have that in fact\nUh the owners of being offended by a particular word really jobs for those people who weren't starkly margin life it's not really mind it face to face that\nThat way than on I understand the historical important and I think kicked knocking specially important story for sure it is it now and especially cats at our age and they should read the story when they read it they should read the story with that word in it but when it comes to perform and what\nI mean I I have to think what about the kids in the play that or the casserole that say that word what are the repercussions to them\nRepresenting the tying run the pet to him about why a lot\nOn another one on the board here\nIs the first\nAnnual shield\nThree times against your friends for\nAlready getting running and then there are a whole bunch [noise]\nAnd [noise]\nThree all Muslims on

there was an F bombs all over the place in an otherwise while what a great movie\nBut that you know it it it kind of war on us we do understand we think they overdo that alone but we do understand in the ... you would expect people in those circumstances to say Jerry in people walking Jerry go ahead\nAnd say uh you know what I heard this vote to kill a Mockingbird\nThat actually reminds me that I think there's a wider trend in terms of the PC\nPolice getting too deeply involved in the arts\nI'm On the last couple of years there were racing they um\nFunds to create a statue for Ernest Hemingway the literature American literature grave and northern Michigan because he spent a lot of time there is a youth\n... same thing happened where people came out of the woodwork and said well how could he of Maine that's offensive comment and in this state fan emily's novels Seventy eighty\nAnd it became quite controversial at one point\nThey weren't going to go forward with the the statue and here this is one of the giants of American literature a Nobel Prize winner\nOf brilliant books like um for whom the bell tolls\nI'm and I'm In and it was a very similar situation and again\nHere's writers artists are they're writing unrealistic manner\nOr to capture a what the characters and what the people were like\nA an engineering so they're trying to re specific ah points obviously so it's interesting but I bring this health reasons\nI think lots of the call and we ... we gotta we gotta we we're way over time it takes on nine fifty nine news radio WGM Jay\nLeno nine Jerry ...

joke on it for some type of shakeout myself to give her something\nTo two points on what you just said one is the situational offensive this word just found out about that and and something just talking to my head when you talked about the artistic presentation day remember all the controversy over the production out east of Julius Caesar and Julius Caesar look like Donald Trump\nNot that that didn't get canceled and he's you know mugged in stabbed as Caesar is in the play\nI I did not I mean I was highly highly critical of the producers of that place but I did not call for it to be

[noise]\nAlright coming up with a couple of minutes but the next iteration of the story about\nA Democrats claiming that I've ever gone high nobody in my argument and just be clear nobody goes awry in politics not less like no other wise but you had Hillary Clinton\nOf course recently say we'll be civil after we went back all the levers of power mild and Eric Holder also agree with that Michelle Obama did not we're going to share her comments from the today show if you miss them and then a really good column on this today we'll get to all of that and a couple of minutes a weapon fourteen\nNews radio WGM Jay eleven sixteen [noise] news radio WGM Jay Jerry Bayer listen I really am excited about the concert my wife and I are going to survive but if I hear any more about ... like my head's going to explode darn it\nI just I'm going to record the game will be all that but I get it I just I I got the feet happened thing going on here in the studio everything about\nHer or does it for man\nLet's get asserted oh wait I'm not going to be there for well that's okay [noise]\nUh and if you are fortunate enough especially the Miller Park man\nJust take it all in because as we know it doesn't happen all that often\nSo\nIn the last week or so the last few days there have been too high profile Democrats\nFormer presidential candidate former secretary of state former first lady Hillary Clinton\nSaying you know enough for civility we need to fight fire with fire and really Republicans but she is talking about President Trump\nEnough with this they go low we go high\nI I just disagree with the anybody going hype that doesn't happen in American politics anymore I'm just being real Eric Holder said the same thing\nMichelle Obama was asked about that yesterday on the today show and gave this answer\nIs not a proper motivator how\nAnd if you think about how you want your kids to be re\nHow you want them to think about life and their opportunity do you want them afraid of their neighbors they want them angry they want them vengeful and if we think of the values that we try to promote to our children savannah your mother right now [noise]\nThis point you have to think about what are the things you're telling your girl\nWhich model do you want them\nA mother as someone who has a role model the young girl\nWe want them to grow up with a promise\nAnd his model something different if we want them to be better and [noise]\nYou know it's a very interesting comment by her and I can't find a way I don't disagree with any of that\nHow their dot com had an interesting response and she said fear is in a proper motivator for they point out it's a good motivator\nWell this is affected motivator in fact there's a famous an NFL Films club with Paul Horning talking about coach Vince Lombardi fears are great motivator fear is a motivator\nBut beyond that her point is adults are supposed to be role models for children and and I certainly don't disagree with us here here's the problem though [noise]\nI mentioned this on the earlier this week in the long segment that I did on this all this really changed here is\nDemocrats see someone who's a bigger bully even they are bullying has been a part of American politics for some time now for Republicans conservatives felt that they were the ones getting bullied that is how Donald Trump got elected the I think even some people who voted for him were surprised at\nAt what he is willing to do and the things he was willing to say\nAnd that's really what Hillary Clinton and holder or talking about is not hiding it anymore\nI made the comparison to Cornel just up in the movie a few good men then that famous speech on the stand in the trial\nJack Nicholson is colonel Jessup says you know Europe parties and this and you don't want to pretend I'm there and doing what I have to do for you well in modern politics they don't ... the colonel Jessup anymore that's all Hillary Clinton and uh holder or talking about\nHis you know what we're not we're not going to hide it any more thorough Republicans don't hide their colonel jobs that pay more so we're not going to hide ours\nAnd my response to that is one I had been highly critical of the president's behavior and you know a lot of things getting checked off the conservative agenda doesn't change my position on that\nAnd it of a problem you have is when someone who is a Republican or conservative\nIt changed my position on that\nAnd it of a problem you have is when someone who is a Republican or conservative is going to criticize behavior of the left you just you have no credibility and doing it if\nYou just turn a blind eye to what President Trump is to it\nSo but you have here is look\nThe Democrats did not take the high road in the whole Kavanaugh saga\nIt got to work got because they didn't take the high road because one Senator Dianne Feinstein didn't do the right thing when she got the information and to and really to his number one they they demonized Brett Kavanaugh before that the allegations from Christine Blasey Ford\nThey considered him an evil based on this judicial ideology or I should say philosophy\nSo that that's that's just that's not the high road\nPeggy Noonan has I think what is an excellent Harlem on this in today's Wall Street journal I Want to share it with you and a couple of minutes a loving\nMs Collins is that she's been alarmed and disturbed by those who suggested unless judge Kavanaugh's nomination was rejected the Senate but somehow be condoning sexual assault nothing could be further from the truth\nThe atmosphere surrounding the nomination has been politically charged it reached a fever pitch\nEven before the forward and the other charges\nThat has been challenging to separate fact from fiction but his decision must be made jokes Kavanaugh's record has been called one of the exemplary public servant judge teacher coach husband and father for hope is he will work\nOut that he will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we are far fewer five four decisions and some of the public confidence or judiciary at our highest\nCourt is restored and so she said she would vote to confirm it was a master class and with a friend called old south or on this combined with the feeling for justice a word of the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic party\nThe howling and screeching that interrupted the hearings in the voting the people who called him the door of the court the ones who chased senators to the halls and screamed at them in elevators who surrounded and harassed one at dinner with his wife\nWho disrupted and brought an air of chaos who attempted the thought never product process is so that the people could not listen and make their judgments you know how that sounded to normal people Republicans and Democrats and unaffiliated defended demonic\nIt didn't sound like the resistance or have to take me to it sounded like the shrieking in the background of an old audiotape or the ...\nDemocratic leaders should stand up to the screeners they happen because they're afraid of them but things like this spread in deep and stand up to your base it's leading nowhere good and you know it Peggy Noonan the wall Street Journal I some additional thoughts on this [noise]\nI mean she characterizes perfectly the way Democrats overplay their hand\nHave no credibility in dealing with the forward issue on two fronts one they made it clear they were never tolerate a justice capital\nFor completely\nIn valid reasons\nAnd unjust reasons we don't like the way he's going to rule\nSo they had zero credibility\nWhen a legitimate issue came up\nAnd I agree with that you knew that you can believe something happened\nTo Christine Blasey Ford\nI also quite frankly do have issues with some of justice Kavanaugh's testimony she clearly is not comfortable with this\nScene history of drinking\nAnd I do not believe he was honest about it\nBut Peggy Noonan point is a valid one\nDr Ford name for witnesses\nNone corroborated\nAbout I actually also though I Will make the case [noise]\nI think there could have been more investigating done\nI understand the Democrats would happen to go on forever I get that\nBut I actually there were people that could have been spoken to\nIn the in the system works for ... dozens\nAnd this notion that Hillary Clinton and\nEric Holder or basically\nGiving their blessing to the ... type of behavior that Peggy Noonan is cursing\nOr criticizing that cursing per se but criticizing and they do so at their own peril\nArt I promise I promised I Would not forget the ... story\nAnd I won't eleven forty three news radio double duty I'm

notion seems like a lifetime\nAway then you may recall\nAnd quite frankly I was on the\nConservative talk host\nCriticizing President Obama for putting his feet on the resolute desk disrespecting the office well George W. Bush did it too\nDisrespecting the oval office I think about quite that seems now compared to what happened\nWhen Kanye West visited\nYesterday with President Trump\nAh [noise]\nKnow broadcast live\nStreamed live social media everything else drops an F bomb\nMade a reference to mail Jeanette cilia\nA call himself a crazy mother bleak\nAnd rude the little bleep the president's indoors\nThis

horrible\nAnd the same people who did make a big deal about\nPresident Obama's size whatever shows up on the resolute desk have no problem with this\nIt's an embarrassing moment that was reality t._v.\nReality t._v. as someone wrote ... reality\nShe held a reality the president held a reality TV show in the oval office\nAnd no one even notice is anymore it's just a [noise] now I Do have to say this to his credit\nFrom what I'm reading anyway\nThe president actually started getting annoyed with this bizarre stream of consciousness\nAnd I I mean there's perhaps that's\nBut he's the one that did this by the way NFL great Jim Brown was also there but nobody really noticed\nBecause of cognac\nIf Trump is that he's in his element President Trump around celebrity\nFrankly that's for he belongs that's his world\nAnd he dragged that world\nInto the oval office yesterday\nConservatives aren't supposed to criticize them well why not\nThis is down and is it it's a\nDark moment would be I

Morgan actually reported\nA big quarter out but you know given the the way the markets trading recently is that just sold the news so even though we opened up about four hundred on the Dow other financials quickly sold off the Dallas quickly backed on change but in the afternoon a lots of lots of ... at the market I think there was no more talk about that perhaps\nSome merely racial tensions with China the Trump Administration potentially planning meeting with the head of\nThe Chinese government November yeah but the fact that we're not going to label China a currency manipulator these are things that are bothered people terrorists in China and [noise]\nYou know just the idea that the Chinese economy they be slowing and I just like you know ... we had earning seeds and we're looking for a twenty percent up and and that's when the earnings for the quarter of a reason about valuation obviously there was a week ago so you look at China's being the second largest economy in the world beyond the United states of course\nSo when China is still going through quantitative easing and\nThey're trying to burn economy that's already growing at six and a half percent maybe seven percent you've got to believe the numbers what comes out of China but\nThe fact is is that it's worth taking notice and things like that so those are all reasons of market kind of pulled back this way corrections or natural right on this is not something that\nWould certainly make little subtle changes in your portfolio instead this would be an opportunity to look at things like we're balancing and risk us well I think that's really what it boils down to less effective he was a reminder to rebalance and we talk to you know clients and\nThe prospects all the time about looking at your portfolio aggregating various holding signal that we're exposed when you're under exposed [noise]\nAnd I thought you know what I mean as you know mark on investment community we'd raise a significant amount of cash several months ago and and we did put that cash to work on friday\nThere filthy our chief investment officer ten twenty two W.

GM Jay\n... wealth management team technology trust\nThe team in ... as well so what now after Wednesday and Thursday well that is a really good question it's a question that we're getting from our clients in when we build these portfolios we tried to do build all whether portfolios\nFor this very reason that these things happen as mark said you know you get these natural corrections and by the way if you look at where we are as a Thursday Derek is actually less expensive\nOn Thursday then it was in January we I listen to a conference call in and and basically given the climate hadn't yet to be five hundred for example the fourteen multiple on ... and the earnings and a Fifteen points seven which is below\nThe twenty five your average and I would argue that given how low interest rates are regardless of which direction they're going\nAnd how low inflation is and how the job market is you could actually argued that the estimation traded above average multiple so certainly stocks or were on sale last week I mentioned we made a play some cash on friday and our expectation is that as you know when the dust settles\nThe technical damage was done this week is not warranted by what we proceed any strong corporate fundamental snow sometimes\nJust investors especially some younger investors or people with less experience and they look at the major markets like the S P five hundred or the dial and they say well the dollars up six percent how come on the four percent of the great question you don't worry that my age absolutely and and you know what this we kind of on pins why that happens which is\nThe diversified portfolio because\nWhen you are a hundred percent equity investor if you've got all your eggs in the S. and pay five hundred and you're going to get the whole ride\nAnd there's reams in means of data that shows when you have a diversified portfolio over time that you're risking goes down and you return goes up I mean isn't that exactly why you build ... ... yeah risk adjusted returns as a sort of a technical term for that\nAnd the other thing that I noticed when the S. and P. this week you know aside from the fact that had been a leading the leading the global markets up to really the last couple of weeks is we actually got the most over sold on the S. and P. five hundred on Thursday since August of twenty Fifteen\nThis at a time when we're looking for some ... step over twenty percent and a quarter of the unemployment raise the lowest level since the miracle met some hiking sixty nine [noise]\nWe have from New York I mean we know the aisles\nOkay but you know so so the way I look at it as it was an opportunity for us to to redeploy cashing area that we felt was attractive\nAnd we'll see how earnings results proceed as we go along you know there can we always look at this thing called the fear and greed and Exxon you've shown that were was that this week I got down to six and you know the internal memo that I sat around are from\nYou know following our choice to you know put some cash to work with the with the fear and greed and ... and has been there for a couple of days\nHistorically that's been a very good by opportunity oversold markets can remain that way but you know that's where we do the fundamental diligence we've talked to some companies and talked to some managers and this is very good\nWhen you look at the number two you're talking about uh six on a scale of zero to a hundred it's not one of the town of zero to a hundred so it's very fearful at this point in time the other thing that I think becomes important her Derek is buying indexes versus active management\nBecause when you're looking right now at the market like the S P five hundred years without a doubt dropping almost fourteen hundred points if you were in just the Dow you've got the home ride down but they're in an active manager gave you know you could be working with somebody who is\nTaking that index apart and looking at the good the bad and the ugly and picking specific companies that are going to\nBenefit Jay and I think that as a great question because right now we've seen that some Seventy percent of new Athens going into the equity markets is going through exchange traded funds which is a manager last a product in there I think as we get in late in this market\nI think active manager and the ... the ability to select is going to be important with no doubt I mean this this unnaturally low interest rate environment that we'd been in since two thousand nine has kept a lot of companies ally that probably don't deserve to for example this week we saw\nHis fears is going bankrupt finally Sears should've gone bankrupt years ago they miss the boat and did a very poor job of\nManaging Internet capability and the rest but by the way just real quickly\nI read a great piece about the uh the original or Amazon was she the Sears, Roebuck catalog right if you think about it but anyway go ahead you're talking about Sears well ... so you said that was the reason we saw that you know we have the auto sector there are certain auto companies that have been better able to manage their way around\nThis

mind what you're what you're getting an exchange ... and at the employee e level a lot of times there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes in a foreign K plan that you just don't know what's happening\nAnd hopefully you don't know because that means it's being done properly right\nUm it's when things aren't being done right that all of a sudden you start noticing them some if there's an HR director CFO somebody that's for sure for their employees how do they work with you we work with employers a lot of this stuff happens on the front end and then we do\nAnd you all are more than by

minute explain that again\nThey're aware of it they trust after we've had these conversations that we're helping them do it right but even a lot of employers they're like yeah I get it conceptually I

Mandy Tanner take money and put it into a five twenty nine plan for college savings from children will form your own retirement\nRight and you know that the financial planner and they won't be said for yourself for your retirement first like a lot of people might think that you have to balance that with the five twenty nine plan if you're already Maxine out irritated meant and he's done you know a good retirement planning meeting with an advisor and you and you're on a path for retirement and you might start to look at by twenty nine plan for your cats\nSo real quick primer from our tax expert if you're saving for your retirement that's on a pre tax spacecraft and if you save it for five twenty nine\nTo mix because he put the money and after tax but you can get a Wisconsin income tax deduction tax free\nGrows tax free so there is tax benefit in the tax advantage fat but when you're trying to retire you always say you want to retire you you want to save for yourself first pray and the kids second some people might roll their eyes of that but that is a long time\nA financial planning concept came back they asked what do they tell you in the airplane ... such a mask on first I rarely yeah All right Robin writes I've got fifty thousand dollars would proceed to the sale I Want to invest to five twenty nine for my kids is it better to put it in all at once or should they space it out\nWell you know and that's a really great question mark because of the things that you that I think of when I hear that question is\nHow much of the fifty thousand dollars does that represent of investor will not worth because that makes a difference and if it's a smaller percentage that could change your answer in fact you know think about what happened this week with what the market that he could give you another answer as well for sure that there is no doubt about\nThat and when you look at you put money into the corner the retirement plan that's one question item can ... the question of hand is do you take it and put it into one account for one beneficiary or do what it is true accounts for true beneficiaries and there's a reason why you'd want to do one or the other right Mandy\nRight yeah and I'm an actress back down and you know David talking about when I hear that question I think for tax life you can only does our three thousand two hundred per kid per year that's where you might want to spread it out and if you're looking at putting fifty thousand dollars into one kid yet they get tax issue for that one year so\nYou know you can go five years of your hand you know you hear that once and so you can you can do that but as far as the invested a reasonable but it really depends and obviously if you had some capital to put\nThis could have been a week to put it to work will have to see how things turns out can we do we squeeze one more we can squeeze one and a penny writes I don't pay much attention to taxes yeah a penny [laughter] I don't pay much attention to taxes but do contribute to charities and ducked it on my return is gone now\nThat is not necessarily gone now but with tax changes that does make it harder to itemize which is how people got that tax benefit for giving to charity so it's just you know conversations they've had before in the past cause with Ari you still going to be a nice thing\nAnd they feel are does it make sense to maybe lump your deductions charitable donations and one here\nAnd you know that's that is the standard answer but I'm not sure that everyone driving down on any for understands what you just said so for

stocks that you pay ten how you approached it and just the fact that you have a dividend strategy and and and are trying to figure out what to do [noise]\nYou've got this opportunity to kind of hit it\nAnd get ready for kind of this next phase of your life it may be that you still hold a little bit of Pepsi or it may be that you do some different things with your wife four one K. or maybe that you do some different things with the annuities but really what you want to try to do is get ready for twenty Nineteen\nAnd you do that you know with trying to evaluate alright why do we need these annuities do we need these annuities um you know with your income can you save\nInside of a set fire re if you're kind of an independent contractor or ... you know depending upon what you're doing there you can still save you can still invest\nBut you know again I Would use this opportunity to kind of a not quite wipe the board or you know wipe the slate clean but really say All right I've got this chunk of money what do I need to be doing right now\nTo get ready for twenty Nineteen and so it's not so much evidence strategy versus non evidence strategy it's not so much joy so micron or Anna Lee or what to do with Ali Baba\nIt's what what types of investments do I need does that make sense I mean ... okay [noise] so I mean if you hold on here um I Want to confirm that I've got some information for you know that we have\nA telephone number but we'll we'll talk about some things are fair\nBut rarely man you've done everything right and what I Want to do is kind of trim around the edges and get you ready to care for the next you know a couple of quarters so that no matter what comes at us in the market just like what you know no matter what came actually with the hurricane you were ready for for different things you know based on what to based on what happened\nFor her but I'd rather you hold on and we'll get you some good how\nAre you very much\nNow we have an email that Kenny has sent to our inbox it asks candy and investing cents dot com and Kenny writes\nI used to be a smoker and have recently become a successful nonsmoker I decided to turn my interest to things that I've been intrigued by like investing my question is where do you suggest starting for a beginner things to read or what sites to visit that sort of thing anything helps and keep up the great show\n... you are awesome uh for\nFor quitting smoking congrats I Know that hey you know how difficult it can be but how life changing that it really is and and really I Love hearing that you are intrigued by investing All right I mean learn how the financial system in this country works participating as and and you know and as an investor\nThese can be pretty pretty rewarding things right so a couple of ideas here real quick first totally keep listening to investing sense\nOr most of what Bob and I do is you know we try to educate listeners okay at past that think about um invest the media\nAre like it sounds it's this online encyclopedia on investing so invested ... dot com and then Morningstar or they've got tons of free education and tons of research they also have an Academy of sorts that you can kind of step through\nSo Kenny I'd start there spend a few months kind of devouring everything that you can and then get back to me and we'll ... we'll go from there\nNow mark has a question he's calling from Ohio at eight eight eight to eight three three it took three seven mark thanks for calling how can we help\nFrom my old it wasn't like he arrived I are a work not only paid on it to get started in Iraq Iran not sure what I find it later that you\nPut money into it four or five years and then you know just trying to get them fight with bin Laden where for him to my or start IRA\nMark good for you here for helping your son get started like this I I might have you reconsider having us\nI I might have you reconsider having your son put money into this Roth IRA instead a thing about opening a brokerage account and that would have everything to do with you having a little bit more flexibility and ... with with the ...\nSo that tax free benefit of the raw ... that you feel better about their ability to brokerage accounts and that'd be innocent\nYeah maybe and and really just demand for flexibility is a function of his son's age okay either way or the portfolio that I've been recommending for young investors like your son is yeah our sixty thirty ten portfolio and\nAh so these are the allegations to three different asset classes that your son might consider that going to talk investments because it's just kind of broad ethic classes okay\nSend me an email ask Andy and investing cents dot com right portfolio reviewing the subject line\nUm but really just get me that email ask any at investing sense dot com and\nThis week portfolio with sent to us from Henry and Henry writes\nI all of my retirement money at the bank in an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half and still working\nAnd I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially what if any other suggestions would you have forty\nWell I'm first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lot of times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing my ...\nBut you might actually be exposing your heart and savings to some overlooked risks are namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with these savings all\nHenri wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than other sixty eight year old and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that he may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nRight saying he sounds like a hard working guy right uh yeah so Henry I might actually have you think about getting your money to work a little bit harder for you\nYou've got these dual income sources sounds like you're in a pretty good financial position um you know I might have you considered portfolio that's a little bit more balanced I fifty percent stock fifty percent bond because\nYou know you're you're not taking any risk with your ear you think that you're not taking any risk with your savings but you're forgetting about inflation and how those could eat into your CD returns so then all of a sudden there's this solid risk that your CD returns are going to be falling short of of what you need and putting you in a position where you could be losing a lot of\nMoney and I I went ahead and log on to bank rate dot com and I'm looking at the CD a returns right now here's what I'm saying the national average for a one year CD is two point four percent\nOr the average return for a three year CD is two point four seven percent and the national average for a five year CD to point seven three percent so that gives you an idea of where CD rates are\nSo what about the historical rates for the return of the fifty fifty stock bond portfolio that you just mentioned\nRight so vanguard studied this fifty fifty portfolio fifty percent stock the two percent bond and they went back and they looked at its historical performance going all the way back to Nineteen twenty six so here's what they found\nThe average annual return was eight point four percent of the best year was in Nineteen thirty three portfolio returns thirty two percent the worst year was in Nineteen thirty one when the portfolio last twenty two percent\nBut since Nineteen twenty six this portfolio has had Seventeen losing years right sounds kind of lousy but if you step back and think about that that means since Nineteen twenty six\nThis fifty fifty portfolio stocks bonds it's been profitable on a yearly basis a little bit more than ... eighty percent of the time confirming the annual\nAverage return for the fifty percent thought fifty percent bond portfolio going back to Nineteen twenty six was was eight point four percent correct right okay so I'm thinking of a simple way to try and compare the return of\nOf that portfolio to the three years CD um because that's where Henry said all this money is in his Iraq right\nSo and then with our eyes are thinking about like the requirement of distributions act right so I you know strip that I'll just keep a sample look at the returns and they hypothetical taxable brokerage account run that same example over the next ten years starting balance of four hundred grand\nA use that twenty two percent marginal tax rates that don't make it more complicated than it\nOK okay well then that that\nThe formula that you just stated that comes to four hundred and eighty four thousand dollars a van so let me run that same example with the returns from uh the stock portfolio at eight point four percent\nAnd at the end of ten years you would have about seven hundred and fifty four thousand dollars that has a traumatic different\nMotor right yeah I mean that's the power of compound gross I sign called it a miracle to seize this opportunity you got to be willing to take at least some risk with your investments if you do\nYou know it's possible that you could be in a much better place financially than if you'd never taken the risk in the first place so Henry hang tight and when the email you some information on how you might invest\nThe or the fifty fifty allocation in sons you know what do we are going to go um but besides Henry I want you to ask yourself is my money working as hard as I Am\nAnd if your answer is no or if you can't answer the question it's probably time to get some help on this probably time to create a long term personalize financial plan that

to make it to what a row after row of thrilling it\nGot to nail biting six five weight over the Dodgers in the game one coming up later this hour we'll hear for brewers starting pitcher weighed Miley he will be the initial out dinner today for credit counseling and try and figure out who is left for the brewers to use\nComing out of the bullpen three boys smiley after last night yeah a lot of relievers used last night hoping to avoid that situation but you have the Dodgers made a game of things going for two hours of the eighth and ninth sitting at the time was Ninety feet away his court could able was able to point out the door but what about due to the bullpen today\nYeah definitely because of that you know\nYou just always wonder okay\nIf a guy going good\nAnd you know why not leave him in and try and get another ending or two out of them have your old and\nIt's hard to argue with the result of the ... and he used to work all the time and uh it all listening to the pre game and post game on Fox last night you know sometimes you wonder how many of those guys actually watched\nThe ... this year and see what's\nGoing on you know Iraq talking about how you know eight or and I come in at night you almost guarantee that\nThey're saying or mismanaged the bullpen and they're going to be worn out through stabbing and you know you'd like to think that by [noise]\nAren't the Dodgers in some one of the same boat I mean I'm sure they plan for her shot it go\nOnly three plus innings\nAnd they had to go to their bullpen you know they're hoping that they can get\nSick or seven or eight and exotic him\nThis is the way the earthquake and all they go to any three innings or anything with a starter and then there and so you know which was more\nOut of the norm last night\nAs what I Would argue as some of the ash all guys but you have to take a ... a little tiny it used to watching that and thinking that it works\nYeah present the phone call Marty the reason I ask you the question is again I think a lot of fans are it took a lot of calls during the regular season so I Know this\nNew bullpen can't be relied upon this heavily for the entire season ended up going to get burnt out or there's just not enough farms red lobsters expanded a kind of alleviate the bird it a little bit had those built in autism September that certainly helped the schedule I thought was favorable uh in September for the brewers it certainly was not they were born that stretch of\nTwenty one games in twenty days that was brutal yeah the brewers have the worst parts of the season during that time\nThere are built in off the off season or a postseason that help the reason I asked the question is is I I think he could brewers fan some time to adopt the philosophy of ... where are you not based on gut feel it's not based on tradition it's not based on getting a starter is far into the game as possible\nIt's not match ups and what the numbers say everything is according to all planned and not a gut feel\nThey're not gonna lie to get a guy out to the plant religious lead to the plan\nI think some of the guys were you know the the studio analyst ... so called experts you're talking about guys who played\nIn an era where both petting was just it was not done even as as far as Iraq is concerned that didn't happen when they get to the age of the American league I don't really need to do it that way it's different in the national league\nSo I think what you're seeing here is the national media and I and I know a lotta brewer fans are kind of frustrated with the national spin on the brewers\nBut think about it they're they're watching to see for the first time I guarantee you they're not paid attention to the brewers was of course the the L it's going to win loss record in Josh heater for some of the right reasons and some of the reasons so they're watching this stuff for the first time within tempt\nSo think about where your mindset was back in April or may and holy smokes how's it going to do this or that is what the national media is saying and so many words I think right now\nIf you don't think it could work at a seven game series\nHow does it work for a hundred and sixty two games that\nI did it work I mean you're talking about a Ninety six when Caesar\nOr the way the championship for the division of get one sixty three a spill into the LDS you sweep the Rockies and boom you're taking gave one\nHits works it's already work it's proven\nTo the national media I think it's a little slow to come around others were style of baseball because it's different it's totally different and it's fascinating and unique\nLots of reasons why I think it feels different here twenty Eighteen as compared to twenty eleven\nThousand eight I'll get

Jeremy ... free for all the junior Guerra Orban burns shot a scene of putting it in parentheses 'cause he's fresh but I'd be shocked if you saw the field today unless it were a multi extra getting sort of deal\nHere the wild card to me as ... as he puts his way out is the last two opportunities he is not got the job done and it's led to rallies\nI don't think you are pitching him in a high lover situation if it's another a spot\nWhere you're up six one like yesterday and look I understand that he's the guy the first guy that started what resulted in this turning into a one run game really quickly but So Daniel is a very good pitcher he was he was very good during the regular season I Know what he's done the last two times out\nBut if you have the opportunity to use him again today in a situation where the brewers have a substantial lead I Would use them and that at that moment but if it's a close game if it's a two three four run game no I don't think it's dangerous in this contest set to\nThe phones we go let's grab her son's in self they'll walk you know double the DMZ welcome hug\nThem guys it very same pretty much everything now thank you know but I think there

well because my dad was one of them soldiers in the south Pacific\nHe wasn't in the army air corps but soldiers in the south Pacific certainly used that language\nShould we just pretend they did\nYou know and and when you make a decision and I understand what you're saying we can't understand the offense\nUnderstand that yes well it's the kids saying those things they hurt rules they're actors and if my sixteen or Seventeen\nStudents can't differentiate that then the minute we maybe have another problem\nTo mark being ... mark here and I am Jay\nYou know I really wanted to touch on the protesting part of things as another caller mentioned or you know he he went a little ... like they're protesting and mob lawyer and all that\nUm I I think they did the right thing ... going to play because that is about ... just because the fact of the dumb people doesn't mean a cloud offensive to other people but but\nThat non violent protests thing when that I feel that there is there something wrong that needs to be righted I cannot fathom and wrap my mind around the fact that we seem to be shifting away from viewing non violent protests as the proper way to handle things you know especially with things like cap or neck and and just\nI'm not advocating for violence I think we should be doing non violent protests but then we get all this bottle of people complaining about non violent protests well what do you expect people to do when they feel that there is a wrong and they have to speak out in and said something about that I thought protest or was\nThat the right thing to do that how you're supposed to have a situation like that is non violently and peacefully protest if we can't do that what do we have left what other its course there are us to stand up for what is right and what we believe in to the group up and say hey this is wrong and we think this church\nLet me say this market they believed it was going to be non violent I Know there was any reason to believe\nOtherwise I should have allowed the protests continue and played both to continue that would be my opinion but apparently\nThey were concerned for whatever reason that the protests would be something I guess I'm married and they they thought was manageable but I where I Would say this I think I and I think maybe you and I are on the same page Americans lots of the car that\nWell I think that you know he just wrapped it together really well because\nIf they thought that you just said the reason that they didn't do it because they thought the protest to be too much to handle that that seems like the exact opposite reason if anything they should think that wow there's the protests that people really don't like that and that's the reason why we should capital play all\nNight it was like listen\nIf I disagree with that mark excellent for the call but I disagree with that that you're going to cancel something because some people don't like it\nBoy I cannot disagree with that more\nBecause that is the essence of free speech\nBut some people do in fact and remember the school board is a government\nSo you can argue that are limiting free speech here\nBased on concerns of some in the population are we still have a lot of people don't want to talk on this we will stay there\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty on accident mortgage talking text line nine forty two news radio WGM Jay ... so some National League championship series at Miller Park is is the best team in the history of the franchise sees\nDefeated ways in from where else ... one of those southern this afternoon or in a hot topic to say the least for one for seven nine nine once it's twice the accident mortgage talk intense ...\nWe've had an excellent variety of calls on every angle of this issue sure with a high canceling scheduled productions of to kill a mocking bird because they got word on social media posts house over the use of the N word\nThey had options they could have just tried to have a conversation with the community and say look we if if you're offended\nUnderstand this is why we think is important and they did on their website for the parents\nBut but apparently didn't get the word out to accurately and honestly complete the narrative the N. word will be use I think that is absolutely fair\nThey could have taken the word out they didn't feel that that would be right to do that\nThey could have just you know the heck with that we're going to we're going to do this and we'll be able to protest they could have taken the word out I disagree with that are cancelled my really don't I I certainly don't agree with that\nI don't do they fear violent protests and and if so why\nTwo days in the wall but tell us a David Hi you're on the um J.\nHey good morning I'm Glad I don't live in ... I I think it's ridiculous to care for the ...\nUm and if we if it's a binary options leaving the word in or here calling them pool of work and if we look at it it was there to kill a mocking bird a classic story um their word to me is a very small part of the story it's really about to say this person\nIs a lower class or this or this person is a radical big I mean there's lots of citizens that could have been used other than the work\nAnd and it's especially timely with the cabinet on trial I mean to kill a mocking bird is really an exact story that map for governor here you know so it's it's a classic it's very timely but I think it was ... your other canceling three hours before\nOr you know grandma to come into town um everybody was right yeah\nThis was a chance for the kids to do a production that they worked lumps on\nYou know and all that the night you know the name\nOf succumbing to a protest so there are lots of them that was learned\nIs that you know the ... of the protesters enough to completely shut down an operation I think that's a horrible less so than the others are just changed the word and move forward\nDay thanks a lot for the call I you know I Know it seems like it's that easy binary choice first let me say that she is absolutely\nRight about the lesson learned from\nA threat of a protest she he could not be more right about that\n... I Would say I think\nThe lesson up well we're going to change something you don't like overthrow out of a protest I is that really\nAny better though that's the concern to Don in the water shot Don go ahead\nIn the morning I ... I Believe that they should not have canceled who play and my take on it is is is that when Harper Lee wrote the book was written as\nIt was written meant to be a time to and to draw attention to the extreme bigotry and prejudice of the time so when people want to protest that they're doing you know certainly protests but they're offended and short of that that's why she wrote\nOh isn't that the ultimate irony here Don is that this book is seen as a driving force in advancing the civil rights movement and is now seen as at least an element of it is seen as offensive to the African American community\nThat's exactly my point\nYeah and it's a great one who's saying what sort of them said\nThanks a lot for the call and and and where that gets ... that you were that gets lost though is you have to put it in historical\nWell we're staying on this I tell you what we're going to take calls probably up to the news and I've got a bunch of tax I I got it there was really good tax I've got to share them I'll probably end up doing that\nA after ten o'clock and it's a hot topic and they're just absolute excellent thoughts um\nEven if I don't agree with all of them I think people are making some excellent points and that's what it should be all about\nThe actor that mortgage talking text line for one for seven nine nine months twenty nine fifty one news radio WGM Jay signs of the foreign news radio WGM Jay with the hot zone topic we have I forgot to ah\nKeep you up to date on bounced back friday on Wall street the dial up to Ninety six point Seventy eight talking about the decision by the shore with a high school\nTo cancel the production of to kill a mocking bird threatened protests but the use of the N word\nTo Amy in West Alice any higher in GM Jay\nOkay so I can be a guy can or can't put a lot of time and I think it's coming up with their production there was a group that monitors pack why didn't understand why rate cut on black man I don't think that with fair to everybody\nAnd that's you know where the rubber meets the road here I think he is can we not share the way things used to be input in contacts I have this ah for for example there were people who were upset that women weren't portrayed more\nTheir role in advertising in Mad Men and the producers came back yeah\nReally women did ... there were all sorts of barrier to interest in that profession now that's not to say there were some women who didn't accomplish but on whole\nBut Mad Men tried to show is it was a real battle\nThen Andrew in Greenfield ... historical context aren't you downplaying the ugliness of fast racism my position is yes\nI think that is exactly right if you slip out offensive words are actions from a historical context that in a sense makes the race is not seen as bad as they were that's just an outstanding points\nBy including the fool ugly concepts you get a better sense of why this is wrong I Will put it this way if you're not willing to take the heat on this then I wouldn't schedule it I didn't choose it\nBecause you probably should have had some kind of sense this would happen\nVery thoughtful and compelling explanation of the time listeners of race relations and fidelity to the work what's the point if you're going to just cancel it\nWith a drama teaches\nWhat's the drama teachers rather need to do is to write an original play based on this very debate college mocking bird kill\nTony pie in Bloomfield Colorado formally Brookfield and he says go birds\nUh let's see I disagree with the person who was planning the protest saying that cancelling the play stops communication on the subject of protests does not communication vote in the way it is I Know I get it but in a way it is a did the protesters\nI'm not going to a city their textbook up and look at a practice of requests to conversation did they suggest holding town meetings prior to the play a\nAfter the play yeah that was the other thing why just\nHave a last minute threatened protests\nThose who suppress or ignore historical facts sets another listener are doomed to repeat said history\nThat that is what I think you're doing an earlier caller said a lot of history has been whitewashed which by the way I Do not disagree\nBut says at me and then the answer to that light washing is more whitewashing\nA another ...\nThis is simply another version of the mob shutting down\nThoughts they're intolerant up no critical thinking Herod or creativity these works of literature offer opportunities to teach and discuss complex issues they'd rather tell people what to think than teach them\nTo think\nWell put\nA next actually short with high school could even make us semesters class work of writing a sad mocking bird kill plays weighing and again I Would almost guaranteed to garner support from the community\nI see it just makes a really good point I don't know if the Hershey a next n word should have been used the end of the production because it's presented the students feelings about the word oh\nOh a conversation afterwards\nThat wouldn't have been ... and the students who are the mouse that word\nFeelings about the word and what they would like to see happen in their community so bring unity\nIt's about that have you're not skin color the website information prior to the production because of the added the importance of the students talking about this lesson\n[noise] I mentioned this earlier but I Will say it again that's really the irony here\nPurpose to things the purpose and what was accomplished by Harper Lee writing this book\nIt was to expose using Nineteen thirties for example she wrote it in Nineteen sixty imagine what would have happened\nIf she attempted to make it contemporary since a salad\nI don't think you'd ever would have gotten published\nAnd she was however using even then a historical and remember it's not set even in Nineteen sixty it's set in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd we are either going to as a society say look you know there there are things in our past we we don't tolerate any more but not pretend that they weren't there\nAnd I do think it's a very very dangerous\nRoad to go down [noise]\nIt seems with every passing day\nThere was a story that just saddens me\nAbout where we are as a society\nWe have become we will get to such a story\nTen thirty it is ten twenty three news radio WGM Jay had them they took game to game furry and that means game on of the ... the U.S is here and not only are the players ready but so was Mr baseball drama or cure shares a unique will get Bob euchre at four thirty almost gone since afternoon news\nI Need to share one more attacks on that to kill a mocking bird controversy before we move on\nMy name is Chris from Madison\nI Wonder why stories like this or Huckleberry Finn or even brought up anymore what purpose do they serve and are they teaching people a word that they might not have ever known if we can and should we be able to try to be a limiting the use of these words altogether\nWell as other callers have pointed out Chris ... it's\n... it's used heavily\nIn some areas of our culture so it's never going to go way but in terms of because something in historical context contain something that's offensive today hot why'd you open that door Chris how far do you go\nIn saying while\nThis offends people so we can't\nPut this on anymore this play includes this or this play includes that\nThere were people I the example I gave earlier\nI'm I'm One of them and I'm not a huge fan of the president but I Am one who said the production of Julius Caesar that had a Donald Trump local like in a business suit stab\nWas deeply offensive to me and I actually thought it was dangerous\nHowever I think I parted ways with some other conservative talk shows where I did not call for the production it'd be shut down\nIt's just a dangerous door to open even a crack and let's be honest it's been open more than a crack and as many callers pointed out\nThat the problem and Chris is okay you say don't show those but then there are people who are offended by other things it is I Know it sounds like the slippery slope the problem is we are on that slippery slope and and we have seen it\nAnd the reality is if you're on comfortable\nWith you know if you learn words they use it you're uncomfortable you have the right not to do that or TV shows that I have stopped watching this quite frankly I think they just darken my soul I don't want Netflix to ban them or eliminate them\nI don't feel that way about it\nI Choose not to watch\nThose who are offended\nCan choose not\nTo participate\nAn unfortunately however that strategy has been one sided over the years\nOne side preaches that\nYou know if they don't like it don't attend but then doesn't necessarily practice and that that's the problem\n[noise] him the next half hour\nI Want to take up a does there being topic\nIt involves the death of the child in the Grand Rapids Michigan area camp County Michigan to be exact\nAnd it falls under a a category of this there is something that I say it's almost\nIt's almost hard to say anything shocking anymore\nBecause that which I I I don't know if\nWe're bombarded with so much stuff every day\nThat it's hard to know a shocking\nSort of be shocked with everything is shocking right\nHere is a story\nThat is shocking is that even so much the death it's the way that the father of a young child dealt with the death the audio isn't great but we're good to try the nine one one call\nNonetheless I\nThink you can pick

refresher this\nThe Dow was\nBipolar again there was one Nineteen one forty nine here is that I Would say a rally is stolen\nA is basically what I'm seeing this far global stocks steady friday calming jittery investors who had been weighing whether this week steep sell off was the beginning of a broader downturn or simply a two day bullet\nMarkets for us to Asia have suffered the biggest shake out since February a bunch of concerns rising interest rates are steep rise and bond yields and escalating trade tensions between the U.S and China I think all of those things factor\nHis earlier this morning in fact the opening bell I think it was up nearly four hundred and you look at a chart out a top again it's again it's up again it's down again [noise]\nI think you need some perspective here\nFirst I've read the piece this morning I I didn't printed for my show prop but it points out the Dow writing or even as of today as of today is open it\nWas seven thousand points higher\nThan the day after Donald Trump was elected president\nI'm old enough to remember when the market wasn't at seven thousand\nBut it also means perspective is important here\nSo I mean if you can't panic\nEven the huge drops that we've seen in terms of percentage which is what counts it's just not what it used to be when you're up in the twenty five thousand range\nBut now for the sixty four billion dollar question\nEven that's low balling [noise]\nIs this the end of a long\nI Will say this there is still obviously some timidity because the everybody knew looking to the futures it was going to be a strong open\nHeat is running out of steam a bit as we had near the ... day\nAre now up one forty four but again as I looked at it um what was the high watermark so far today a DVD yeah near four hundred dish uh from what I can see looking at this\nSo even even today you're not seeing it come roaring back the way it looked like it was going to do in the opening bell I had to stop predicting the stock\nMarket a long long time ago\nI spoke with someone yesterday who is twenty eight years old\nAnd she's I don't even want to let your twenty eight years old\nI mean you certainly at

IRA stuff this is through the roof\nCompared to where they were just a couple of years ago\nYou know the temptation can be great\nOh man you know do I want to start over again on this stuff what if

hasn't gotten a lot of things done legislatively the pro business mentality has help\nThe economy is soaring\nThere is no disputing that however\nIn showing the economy the raising of inflation rates as the raising of interest rates to keep inflation in check and that that really hasn't reared its head just yet so\nI think the president is being overly critical of the hikes but I Do think there
