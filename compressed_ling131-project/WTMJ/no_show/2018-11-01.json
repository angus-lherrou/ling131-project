of Halloween we have a taking some time here on the program to identify certain NFL teams and we will relate a piece of candy to them Jeff\nUh we'll spend four hours to try to figure out which candy as best associated with all the different teams in the NFL who is the candy answer key that's that's what I Want to know a well that's a good point uh I don't know the answer to that either but I figured well just throw it up on the wall every candidate\nSee if it does sticks right now and somebody's got to be Skittles somebody's got to be quick somebody's got to be on the joy\nAnd one of the Green Bay Packers if you're going to associate a piece of candy or candy bar one of the Green Bay Packers\nThe dump dump suckers there the the the question mark the mystery flavor because you had no idea what you're going to get to talking about I mean that they they're consistency is within their inconsistency Chicago Bears Chicago Bears are to me are a hundred grand because that's about what they had to throw out there just to be competitive\nCleveland Browns their mouths and I'll tell you why now coconut sometimes it's good but at least with an all the joy you get the joy of having an almond into candy bar ... chocolate ... there's nothing there the New England patriots old reliable got to be a crunch for\nPittsburgh Steelers or do we have much of the Steelers\nI we did and I'm trying to think we're here if I Would definitely did this and how great we were doing this with you also was ... where do you describe that then that's how we got to figure out the candy ... ... what are you using to describe the Steelers ... the season because they're not what they were\nYet they're right there to be in position to win the division ...\nRight\nSo let's get it but it used to be good now maybe not so much ... so you're looking for the thing that boy that used to taste delicious and now it's still sort of okay but I just don't see why don't like it as much as I used to the Milky Way you know why because the candy bar\nTo the Milky Way you know why because the candy bar achievement has gone so far beyond just tears chocolate and caramel okay All right we're having some fun now so let's let's keep going into the Packers will play the New England patriots this weekend what do we have for them the patriots or their their call yes we've already got my all her life how about the Oakland Raiders\nOr the Oakland Raiders are I think their candy corn I disagree on guys what a shock accident loves candy corn\n... it's just awful just give up its flushed down the toilet okay I could subscribe to that\nThe Atlanta Falcons oh boy\nSo I've got one for the Atlanta Falcons here\nThe Atlanta Falcons are three musketeers when I bought into a three musketeers I expect more on the inside I Want more the inside because I eat lots of feel like this should be good at\nThe child casing is there and and then it was just like all fluff it leaves you wanted more I don't I don't know what's inside there it's just not it's not getting me to bite again while I'm our audit something ... see I think we're getting somewhere but he worked giants to me\nI'm with the ... back in training camp in the pre season he goes down in the first game they don't replace him wreck Burke had probably their best all around running back goes down and we three\nThey don't replace him a rookie first round pick Sony Michel who missed all training camp suddenly rocked into every down role and he's been hurt ...\nLooked like he was he sustained a season ending injury against the bears but he actually a\nPractice at the end of last week uh I Would I Would guess these again kind of decision for this but he didn't play this past week and you know they have Kenyan born or on the roster they started not use him James whiter more than half catcher\nAnd they decided to use coral Patterson I'm the old Viking tail back you got the most carries tenure at Tempe area\nAnd ah outside of one run didn't really do anything and so yeah there are hurting and I would say I would say this is not at the at the midway point this is not the normal patriots team by now\nNormally what you get is the first war games they kind of couple along play a bunch of players whatever and then they start hitting their stride this team has not come close to hitting their stride yet so uh this is a good time for the Packers reclaim them\nYou know Greg there will be some pretty game might but leading up to the game of course you're talking about do the best quarterback to ever play even though they won't play each other's specifically and whatnot we know how that works but\nWill this game live up to its heights I I feel like it's it's high but I feel like it's also token hype because the Packers are skillful along right now still of course in the hunted a very strange division the ... the north and\nYes Aaron Rodgers is magnificent and so it was Tom Brady but will be one of those classic Brady Rogers do you think it'll it'll play out that way\nI think it will I mean I've just for a couple of reasons the\nFirst is that in the time that you know I've been on the other side I mean I left I left in the middle of to switch from the Packers\nBeat the patriots beat in the middle of two thousand ten and the Packers game here is the last time they were there and that was the ... game\nAnd the the Packers gave them all they can handle a pack or should have won that game the patriots ended up winning that game and then four years ago the the papers go out there and the Packers beat them it was their last last I think before\nThey won the super bowl I'm so the\n\nThe Packers interplay up this lack of it the way up to their opponent and also the home and so you know this is Sunday Night Football the Packers usually played pretty well and that ... type of atmosphere and the other thing is look you know ...\nYou know the the patriots events are often certainly has the potential to put up forty three points like they did against Kansas City\nAgainst um you know bad defense but again it's also the the capacity in all likelihood is going to give up a lot of points if you can cash in in the red zone and so I expect us to be tight very high scoring affair and I think we're going to see Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers\nArid out like we all want him to\nWere you surprised the patriots did not make a move going into the deadline\nOr a little bit um I wasn't on one hand that you know they've had a lot of cap issues um because they they have not hit on the draft in recent years this year they aren't really getting any contributions outside of my shell and he's hurt\n'em you know they they haven't got much out of the draft in in in quite a few years and\nSo that means that you're having to pay a lot of veterans and and they didn't have much kept space we did a story a couple of weeks ago about how I mean they all had a million dollars a cap space left and that was not going to last until the end of the season so they had to do something so they restructured Gilmore\nUm and that bottom some space and people were like oh well they can make a deal it was going to have to be pretty cheap because they still don't have a whole lot of cap room and so I'm not\nSurprised in that aspect the other aspect look they um they made deals I think for five straight years they need help I thought they might either go for a receiver to help Brady or\nA a linebacker safety type to help them in coverage because they can't cover anybody out of the backfield or or titans right now um but they didn't do that and they're going to have to make do\nCheck out his work is the owner an operator the Boston sports journalist or just finishing up took a train was a busy day at the bit our

Johnson thoughts on the matter I don't know\nI I maybe that was the philosophical difference I have no idea maybe it was just a boatload of money being offered by the Cincinnati Reds and it caught the brewers by surprise and they just they weren't going to pay that kind of money\nWell here's another way to think about it the last time they read changed managers before the last time to change them where they got Bryan Price so I Believe what they're pitching coach beforehand if there's some part of their Johnson that says look there's no where I can really go in the brewers organization aside from being the pitching coach I look at the reds and and see they have turnover maybe I can become a manager at one day there\nPossible yeah very possible I I don't know I don't know if that's the goal or not or again because this is not official by the reds there has been no official announced that there's been no press conference or anything of the light so we're all kind of guessing\nAt this point kind of on the outside looking in just wondering but I did not expect to see that news breaking about five o'clock this afternoon\nThat was surprising to me it was very surprising to me a couple of and dug it's from the brewers today they picked up at opposite on one player they declined an opposite on another will tell you who after this and double duty object\nCan get for me to be by

floor tomorrow night when the bucks or in Boston to face the Celtics\nAre back to the brewers here so you get to these points in the off season where there are deadlines to do this and deadlines to do that well\nIt's coming upon that time were the brewers have to make decisions on you know who the tender a contract offer to uh\nYou know who the tender a contract offer to a ... options to pick up things along that line well today the brewers decided that Jordan Lyles pitcher acquired from the Padres during the season no longer a part of their plans they declined to three and a half million dollar option I think that was in expected move\nThe brewers did however pick up to three point one Seventy five million dollar option I'm reliever Jeremy shepherds when my opinion at three point one Seventy five billion dollars a day of Oregon they complete bargain if he delivers a regular season like he did last season for the brewers he is a bargain\nIf he is what he was in the playoffs so it might be a long year for Jeremy ...\nUh it was a tough postseason for Jeffers that's for sure for a while he was the only guy with an array\nBut I think having a back at a reasonable cost I mean it's part of why the brewers were able to build so much death in their roster their entire roster I mean not just pitching is because they have very high quality arms\nAt reasonable cost boy pitching costs a lot of money really good pitching costs a lot of money in today's world of baseball especially start where the brewers did the value placed sort of thing with the lead shot scene being among the more expensive starters on the roster\nGuys like Jay Sanders and not exactly breaking the bank's name was act Davies Jimmy Nelson you name it and they're able to commit more resources to the bullpen so a guy like Jeff first comes in and I'll tell you what three point one Seventy five million\nFor that kind of production that's impressive stuffed Rashid or I think it's still on the five hundred and sixty thousand dollar range I mean you're talking about bargains that's how you become has a small market team a contender you can really\nBuild out your roster the brewers were able to do it makes several moves as we know are ultimately just felt a little bit short\nSo coaching news the roster turnover news it's all happening here for the brewers are the more to come I guess a big day tomorrow here by the way so I Do want to go through some of the nuts and bolts of what's happening tomorrow or for those that listen to six twenty WGM J\nUh you're not really gonna notice any changes it's going to say it's business as usual era WGM Jay however down the hall it's going to sound a little bit different ah Ninety four or five K. TI country at five AM tomorrow we'll turn\nTime to get out there so I I think the only reason they're doing this because they say hey we don't want to risk going into restrictive ratings because we still like his potential it's it's more of a about potential that is about this year\nWell and and that's why they hung on to Rashad von for as long as they did I understand that uh he was a young cat when they drafted him that made sense to me I don't know I I think this makes it muddy the waters a little bit and I think\nThere is some pressure to move on from some players and it might be Matthew Delaware Dover Tony Snow at the ... I mean you got to protect your future here\nBrogden it'd be interesting case out of all these names even more so than DJ Wilson to me because until the last what a last two nights ago and then they give a game before that he had not done hardly anything the season\nHe's an older young player for all intents and purposes you use what twenty four when he came in as a rookie that becomes interesting how much money if you actually worth it 'cause he\nWould Malcolm rocking to be a starter on on many NBA team he it'd be a a nice piece on any team right right and it'd be a starter on some but then you have to to weigh what are you going to pay him\nWell what does that work so you what do you pay a player who you\nKnow how much better if he really going to get that I write in and I think this goes back to white teams are somewhat ... with a Nineteen year olds coming out of Kansas in Kentucky you just see that oh my God that losing with potential versus the for your guy who was a defensive player of the year in the ACC that's big boy basketball\nYou feel like yeah steady maybe not get a lot better but steady we can use them\nThat's what teams are ... with the one and done guys and not so willing you must get penalize if you're twenty three coming out of college after four years of basketball which seems odd\nBut you're right I mean that's why you have the conversation that he really going to get that much better maybe not but is it good yeah sure absolutely [noise] ah it so it it it's kind of a small story but I think just looking ahead here the bucks of a lot of figuring out to do\nAnd that's why they get paid the money to do it because I have no idea how they're going to make this work you have to be cognizant of the luxury tax threshold I mean all sorts of different things and the cat will be moving up here in the NBA\nSo there's going to be some built in pushing just you know a normal course of time and and it's just kind of how it works in the NBA\nBut something to pay attention to where it's more central after this on WGM Jay were presented\nBy Miller Lite plenty to get to hear including what in the world is going on at the University of Maryland this story gets more bizarre by the day and I think finally the right move was made we'll talk about it all up to this\nMorning news from overland afternoon we've got the latest on your ride home WGM Jay ... center is here for you he was ready O'Donnell GM Jay\nW TMZ news is there and when you want it with the Amazon Echo simply launch the Alexei ass then can the settings menu shoes slash briefing searching select WGN Jay and tell them access to health and WGM Jay\nSay listen live it was all say whether for something for high gas choice\nMore information to W.

watching a a cheerful parents talk about the situation going on at the University of Maryland the football program has been under scrutiny\nHere for several months you might remember in late may get office of Lima Nineteen year old kid suffered a heat stroke during the course of\nMaryland football practice you later died on June thirteenth because of heat stroke\nIs became national news what exactly happened how was this player being treated throughout the course of practice didn't anybody noticed what was going on\nAnd the stories are are brutal regarding the treatment of the player who is being dragged from drill to drill being propped up by his teammates and bright from grilled to drill team mates pleading for help coaches doing nothing about it\nDJ jerk and was pleased got administrative leave not only for that incident jerk in the head football coach at Maryland\nBut for other incidents that were being reported by members of the football program calling the culture at the University of Maryland with regard to the football program as toxic\nAnd indeed tail\nPlayers outlined their treatment by other coaches how they're being treated verbally abusive sometimes physically abused I mean it was just it was awful behavior\nThe kind of stuff that if you were a parent you would read it you see it and you'd say no way no way my son is ...\nDid you see it and you'd say no way no way my son is not going to Maryland to play football\nI don't care what the coach says in my living room about taking care of my son I met letting my son played football at the University of Maryland so the University of Maryland the board of reasons\nIn a hand picked committee of others decided to investigate what what is going on here let's see what we can find out so do you think ... was placed on administrative leave\nAs this investigation was unfolding well less than twenty four hours it go the Maryland board of regents recommended this school retain that football coach DJ Dirk an end up letting director David Evans\n\nA player died\n\nThis as you might expect was met with shock\nAnd it can only be described as in a holding an absolutely appalling decision by the University of Maryland board of regents\nSo the cheerful parents that I watched speak today was the father of the player who died and he said it looks like it'd be but this whole situation he described as being spent in the face feel like you've been felt like he'd been kicked to the ground and then spit in the face\nSo this story sort of persisted immunity you name it you named the media all but they were covering this story on a national level\nAnd I if there were there was no sense of a devil's advocate in the world tried to stick out for DJ Dirk and it just wasn't happening\nSo about five o'clock this afternoon another note came out less than twenty four hours after dean DJ Dirk in was reinstated as the head football coach ... was fired\nI have several questions but my one the overarching question is this why can't universities\nInstitutions of quote higher learning get it right the first time Ohio State didn't get it right the first time Penn State didn't get it right the first time Michigan State didn't get it right the first time there are more universities the lump in in Maryland could not get it right the first time\nAnother black guy and the Big Ten\nThe Maryland board of regents met five times to arrive at their decision to reinstate DJ Dirk in the\nPublic overturned it is in twenty four hours well how did it happen Greg well here's how it happened I'll tell you exactly how it happened football's a cash cow at the NCW level it whether your team is good or not if you're in the Big Ten conference you're making a lot of money\nAnd it's no different at Maryland DJ directed by the way the tendons Fifteen in his tenure at Maryland is not a winning program but money is coming in because it's the football program in a major conference but what happened is is students on campus threatened to protest\n\nDid you guys that love talking big scare valley way some of the players that may or may not be on the scene going forward yeah you know this

can be clicking buying stuff and then you as a parent you're the one who had to pay my sat\nWith apple or with Google but more important\nTime spent on screens now our producer Joe is\n\nIs someone who has a child who's five and a child who's two or three three and a time flies and your kids you and your wife have very strict rules on any screen time at all even including\nTelevision yeah so we try to limit television consumption to forty minutes a day which even honestly seems like a lot especially the way they respond when we turn the TV off\nBut definitely the euro cell phone time and euro either that or any sort of tablet time [noise] uh no apps or anything like that I it just in my opinion for our kids at least are the sort of stimulus or they get from a lot of those apps and make some of the more mundane things in life\nFeel even more mundane like it's really hard to adapt to the high ... high touch I'm super fast world of playing games in and out and then kind of come back to normal life and just have to eat dinner with the family um which is tough for three and a five year old to actually be able to handle that well\nSo you know as parents I I say that each of us handle it how we do I say that I completely failed it the way I mean my oldest daughter this wasn't an issue\nBecause electronics were not everywhere like they are now but I say with my two younger kids that\nI was a big fail at this and my wife was much more aware\nOf the potential for harm then I was I didn't recognize that\nAnd I I feel bad about that that we as parents need to recognize what we do it safely with a very young child you're rewiring their brains and I'm not one of those people who believes\nYou ban it entirely that's why there's a range of opinions and Joe when his wife have said none at all\nBut having the tight collar on time watching video of any kind and you may find that any at its free as one you want to avoid\nAs an apple tree how are they gonna pay for it they're going to pay for it by having ads embedded in it so actually chi chi telling you to pay for it paying for Netflix if you want to let them watch video instead of letting them why traditional TV where there's going to be all the ads is a way you can\nUh prevent the advertising from having not do influence on the young child's mind\nBut the screens themselves having limits that are age appropriate on how much time on a screen\nIs great and with the new fancy wireless mashed products that I recommend you have in your home but he'd be much more reliable and faster Internet your home there they're going to be completely calm and if you're out working at technology and all through this fall\nThere's instead of having a traditional wireless router\nThese things all at base or getting back to an out you're able to control how much time you're kids can have on screen automatically So Joel mentioned forty minutes how would you enforce that well with the ass you shot a device down\nWhen they when a child's use would hit forty minutes Don whenever the rules are you putting in place it's a very easy way for you to enforce to using electronics to defeat electronics yes we've come to that\n[noise] oh boy mad some of those on the car to our show Hi Matt\nI click it's an honor to talk to I've never been on live radio before\nWell it's great to have you here and you have a question for me that if you knew the arguments that go on and our house over what you're about to ask me oh boy me with it\nYeah I can imagine so right now I live on my own and Minnesota and in the winter it gets pretty cold and I was wondering when I'm at work for a ten hours a day what temperature say my thermostat at when I got and there's no one that heat in the house so that I'm saving as much energy as like an\nOkay so wow you didn't ask me what I keep my service [laughter] nice to meet all asked me a lot so what temperature\nPeople ask me a lot so what temperature are you comfortable when when you're home and\nThe way I cared about sixty four sixty five weight when you're home yeah oh my goodness I found somebody who is worse than I Am also long sleeves and blankets are for\nWell see that's my kind of attitude my family says they all were miserable during winter 'cause they say that I keep the house like it's a refrigerator to save money\nThat's after we've done extreme insulation in the house and all kinds of other things to reduce energy consumption so mhm if you are you're shocking me that you like the house sixty four so you would be okay\nAnd if you get a nest thermostat something like that they're really cheap now get a smart\nThermostat from a different company\nOkay so you've got one I Would say generally if you keep it at fifty five degrees when you're not there and a half hour before you typically come home but you have the smart thermostat set to go up to sixty four sixty five\nYou don't want to let it go below that you have danger with the potentially pipes breaking\nIt also makes it much harder for the house to heat backup but if you have a roughly eight to ten degree lower temperature when you're not home and you like to have when you're home that would be where you'd want to be\nThat's great thank you because I've been keeping at fifty eight and I felt like it still is too warm when I'm God\nYes I agree so if you were if you like sixty four you could go maybe to fifty four or five fifty five is a pretty good number\nOkay and I can't eat I Can't even begin to tell you how many people are listening to you and me right now Matt who think both of us are ridiculous\nBut it makes it fun for me when I get called the think I'm saving money so I've got extra flannels well\nGood for you it's funny I I was uh the other day I was in a store that was selling it was all day and they were selling these men um wintertime lawn pajama pants were like um what's that material like flannel\nAnd it seems like they'll keep me warm when the temperatures like forty four in the house Tom how're you doing today\nVery good so you live in California and listening to someone in Minnesota talk about winter must sound like really crazy\nYeah it's it's here we are getting towards winter at Seventy one and sunny outside for us\nIt's pretty good temp isn't it yes [laughter]\nYeah my wife prefers to the temperature and much of California is no temperature it's just basically you feel perfect and you don't even think about what the number is\nYes it's much nicer energy bills all that [noise]\nSo speaking of numbers there's a number that you've been accustomed to getting for free that's not going to be there anymore what number is that\nYou say in a an account which I learned about them you several years ago and I use it for generally the psycho and also helps with one of the credit reports and I've always trusted it\nAnd um but I just received an email a few days ago saying that they're going to be going away and they're asking me to join something called bank rate\nBank rights completely legitimate and quiz all I think was the pioneer and you must have been listening to me for a long time if you\nHeard me talk about quitting because that was years ago that I talked about them being this great pioneer with free information available and all that and they've been eclipse in recent years\nBy credit karma which is the largest source of information where you can see what's going on with your credit and all that and credit sesame\nWho both been a quicker in the marketing their bank rate is a very successful clearing house of

this upcoming adventure\nShow carpet but non poke around for rental car parts is on the Internet down there in Costa Rico so boy found one on one way or we take a look like a dollar fifty a gay oh yeah that's probably the truth on most of the others are making\nOK so Costa Rica comes with an unpleasant surprised when you rent a car\nOkay the government there is one of the few countries on earth that the government makes you buy a whole bunch a pseudo semi fake crummy insurance type products with your rental\nSo when you see a car rental company for Costa Rica listing raided a dollar a day or five dollars a day or whatever they're just trying to more un and then for the government mandated semi insurance things they charge you a fortune\nSo we've got a loss leader and what I've recommended in the past with Costa Rica is rent from a well known and recognize company\nBut before you even do that you want disclosure from them which they will have on their website what the mandatory a semi insurances are going to cost you\nOkay so expect the car rental in Costa Rica to be actually a fair amount more money than you have anticipated\n... teamed up closer to accurate\nNo it'll be more than that with all the junk they make you get\n\nUh with all the junk they make you get okay but again there's a range on the junk fees like one company maybe two or three times the cost of another\nFor this stuff that the Costa Rican government requires you have you know normally when I travel somewhere\nI anywhere in the world I refuse all the pseudo insurance if the car rental company tries to get me to get\nBecause of the coverage I have my own auto insurance even outside the United states and then I have a credit card that covers the gaps in what my auto insurance doesn't cover none of those rules apply in Costa Rica\n\nSo if I tell you what I'd like you to do is go to like trip advisor and read the briefings about renting a car in Costa Rica or just Google a Costa Rican car rental and you'll see the host people put up about all the stuff that comes\nOut of your wallet for Costa Rican rental\nOkay what what are the price range us in the can is as close\nI Would guess all and at the low end you'll be paying thirty five a day for a car\nA while yeah\nYeah that's completely different than a dollar a day isn't it a little bit\nAnd I must congratulate you might because you you smelled Iraq and you wanted to check that out because you knew that they weren't going to rent a car for a dollar a day\nAnd they've got you they're standing in front of the counter and your dollar a day becomes who knows what with all the junk fees they add on and what are you going to do at that point so knowing in advance and knowing what's going to cost that's the right thing\nJenny joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Jenny\nHow are you I'm doing great how are you\nGood tell me how I can be of service to you\nWell I listen to your recommendations and I got it half of questions and half the problem that you recommend it for to have a ... to pay all your financial transactions with\nIt I actually use my chrome but to travel and all that and I bought my last chrome book is a reconditioned when a few years ago for\nHundred and nine dollars\nAnd the thing is starting to the joints whatever you call it where you\nOpen it up and it's starting to sound like it's a two hundred year old man trying to get up from us over to somebody who's making these terrible crunching noises and all that and I just won't let go of it because it's been so good and it's been so cheap\nEven with all my banking online I'm self employed I have a fight taking credit card transactions for my clients but still pay the check right check so I'm used to use an app on my phone to take that share the check and make it\nThat way I'm sure would I be able to do that on a crown fires\nAnd I you know I Would do that on your phone because you know the ap from the financial institution you're making the deposit with that is a better safer more secure way for you to do it and with the chrome Booker any laptop\nOkay okay well I mean it had I still have the ... the okay let's say that's fine that's fine that's where I come up with the brand name that there's several different\nThough no chrome book is crumbling is like the operating system and yeah and the one that I bought for like a hundred and nine was a refurbished one and it just works words that one I have is a Fifteen point six inch screen so it's a little bulky but it's been great to have\nTo be a reckoning on anything like if I go to Amazon shaggy that on the\nWell if you guys do any of your banking on the chrome Booker bill pay or anything I Want you to just to use it for that purpose I wouldn't want you to doing any checking of email e commerce anything like that it's almost like um you're spending\nA hundred or so dollars on an insurance policy\nTo give you better protection for doing your financial stuff\nStill shock on my other computer\nRight so let me tell you how freaky I Am I have on my desk I have my financial chrome book and then I have my chrome book for all my Web surfing and they just sit side by side\nIt enough\nSo you think about people historically think about when you buy a computer that you have to spend as much as like five hundred dollars if you don't have to anymore and computers have gotten to be so inexpensive that you just aren't putting a lot of money into these things\nThey have done is with us and die and you want to sell the seven seas an unusual way you want to be living among cargo containers is that true\nBut I'm looking for is what they used to cold traps either spinning off and on the container ships\nGenerally at the has and by the way you must be calling us from somewhere way out in the Pacific ocean 'cause you have the world's worst phone connection right now\nOh I Apologize for that actually show some got it\n[laughter] that's funny well they're giving you phone service like you're on the seven cities [laughter] so but you would like to go do that now you know that you've got to have lots of free time to do that right\nExactly 'cause you really don't know when a ships going to leave and then the craziest thing is even though they may be scheduled to go to let's say a specific poured they may pick up another shipment somewhere else and you go completely different route so you've got to be completely and totally\nFootloose and fancy free even go anywhere at any time\nRight I'm I'm retired and I'd be traveling by myself so I think that the order to build up pretty good\nThere are people that love doing it the irony is that it tends to be more expensive than going on a traditional cruise ship", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city":
