I'm\n... I'm going to say nah 'cause I think I think pat mom's [noise]\nWouldn't even get my vote for now and you know we'll see you know part of it is a you know are they going to make the playoffs and certainly looks like\nThe cheese and the rams are on that trajectory so close to say but I I was talking to jump to the fact or know off the Packers will go to a three and the next five games um that is a that is [noise]\n\nThat's about as fact yes I think they will surprise ... they'll still one of these on the road\nAnd it will be Miami fact or not Eric Jones will lead Green Bay and carries this week\nI had better be facts otherwise ah I I don't know what dye eggs everybody you know why they don't get the bomb or we have no idea where we're out of answers for you it was you know come back to the suspension you know they own a pitch counts I got no answers now so if if he doesn't lead the team and Gary\nI Know what to type in fact or not the Packers will swing a trade before next week's deadline when you say not a I mean part of it is who's out there um and another part of it is the quality the um\nYou know they're not one player away this is the problem you know even going back to like Darrell Thomas 'cause it's like well OK if they can address the safety position that's great and by the way they were shot Greenland might be able to do a little coverage safety which I think it's definitely going to help\nBut they're more than just one player away from making that jump to being the team to feed the NFC North now that doesn't mean you don't get me aggressive but that being the case if they go the other way to acquire picks [noise]\nUm I Would say not because that was sort of go against this whole idea of what we want to get Rogers another civil rights aptly\nCalled the giants are doing it well sure but they traded ... well how did that when you are but the problem for five years back yard but if the Packers don't reach the postseason there'll be a new head coach of Green Bay next the high we don't qualify\nThere'll be a new head coach of Green Bay neck see how we do qualify opted to they have a winning record their eight seven and one to say I think if if if they fail to make the pilot and losing record\nI think this is the ... there are you you can't go through any more coordinators but there's coaches right every week over the last several years did you make the off season now I have no doubt\nAt three guys with their coach experience did it last seven and I can say I read hardly wasn't ready for primetime but if you go and he went shopping wins again this year what what what I Know a Rogers wasn't one hundred percent but boy it directly to avoid\nThat wraps up factor and all that joy that yeah yeah I was what I thought\nOr you know he could rip off Trump plays at any time\nAnd I go back to the San Francisco you know what really concerns me about the defenses\nForty niners had deceptive speed I don't think we really realized until we saw them in front of us just how they were and how the how easy it would have to get to the quarter good one and a half but I mean also the running backs 'em a most or had a I I just don't recall him looking that fast or being that fast moving too much of a\nUm a prior to uh to that Monday Night game\nThe rams hepatitis B. okay so um\nYou know it's going to be tracked me no doubt about it and um I I think the thing that we've learned with your fences you know they they can\nThey can do as much as I did it when it had to do with the fourth quarter is about the defense going back to San Francisco was forever ago they did get the job done in the fourth quarter the forty niners that like a third and two didn't convert it had to kick available at thirty five no George Kendall dropped to a pass on that one\nI'm Kevin came up with the interception ... and I knew there was also a third down so they were able to get off the field or at the very least you don't feel goals instead of touch downs\nBut again that one thing we're talking with a forty next to nothing we talk about the rash see this kid has it ...\nIt has NFC championship game against it in a written all over it to be\nHere that I don't think the ... effects can slow down the rams office I really don't it's a matter of Canada ... keep up that as long as they do great you're going to have a very interesting gave it a high scoring game or the over under she'll be like Seventy for good to say\nBut in a cave against Atlanta the ... office made mistakes they turned up all over but they didn't catch it opportunities where they were driving so I mean that is a recipe for disaster or against us Ramsey well and I would also qualify everything I mean there's the Packers are out of gas\nI'm going into the an average of game so yeah I mean I'm sure it was really that the officers had to carry the day is a little bit different this time around but your eyes are I mean you you cannot make mistakes offensively hum you have to take advantage of every other\nDidn't have to be finished drives a cab to drop patches cannot have this accident by the way the rams are being heat from all over the place because it was very very good defense of wind so it's yeah I mean really sound like it's a tall that it is the reason why the rams or something to do\nA pretty good back to come in ... they should have plenty of gas coming up

welcoming the brewers\nWeekly here on WGM Jay my name's Matt Pauli happy for the next hour as we take you 'til nine o'clock and we are talking all things\nMary in Brookfield texting into the program I'm disappointed that the brewers loss in the world series is not going to be played at Miller Park tomorrow but\nIt was an awesome ride while it lasted I Can't wait for spring training and then the Christian yeah let's let's go with all the shows things protecting and Mary\nI Do how could you not enjoy what happened in the last month in if you if the brewers losing game number seven and not making it to the world series\nTainted your enjoyment like retroactively tainted your enjoyment of the playoff run\nI'm not trying to tell you how to be a fan but I Would say you got to maybe maybe look a little inward and say can I enjoy nice things\nBecause that was that was special I I've said this over and over and over and you've probably heard me say that if you've listened to me on the radio at all but I'll say it again because it is it's remarkable it is absolutely\nOne hundred percent without a doubt remarkable what the brewers accomplished in a\nRelatively short amount of time you know what specifically go to the twelve game winning streak in the course of\nTwelve games the first when that twelve game winning streak was a series win against the pirates they had really struggled against the pirates so getting a win to clinch the series against the pirates that mattered\nAnd then as the winds continue to accumulate after that\nThey went from being on the playoff bubble then they clinched a playoff spot at the very least they were going to be the the the second wildcard\nAnd then they clinched a position where at the very least they were going to be the top wild card and they would host a playoff game\nAnd then they were able to put themselves in position to get to the game one sixty three against the cubs and they won that and not only did it give them the the top seed in the national league with the most of my wins a it gave them the division as well so the windy in central and\nThen they go into the division series and they're able to sweeps through the Colorado Rockies and then they open up the and I'll see us with a one that is\nThat's a lot of things to accomplish in twelve games and then even after they lost they were able to push the national league championship series\nTo seven games and it's really easy\nIt is really really easy and I'm not trying to go back on this too much because we've been able to move forward for the most part\nBut it's really easy to look at look at that seven game series against the Dodgers and\nFind those moments that stopped\nThe brewers from getting to the world series especially in terms of losses that game to last at home that was tough there was a four three lost you had a lead in it\nAt one point it kind of felt like a commanding lead like when you were when you were sitting there watching that game and gave number too even though it wasn't a large run differential it felt like they were completely in control of the game and then just the snap of finger it completely turns around so you look at that you look at the Thirteen any loss\nIn Los Angeles that ends up being eight to one loss for the brewers and how they had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to win that game\nAnd it's really easy to do that when when you come up one wins short one one short of the world series it's really easy to do that you know last year\nThe team came up one game short of the post season they finished one game out of a postseason spot last year so what do we do what do we do as soon as that season ended last year\nWe took an entire one hundred and sixty two games schedule\nAnd we started picking all the spots over the course of the season of it just wouldn't have given up the run here they would have won that game that we're just won this game if they would have just won this game look at all these opportunities that they had to win games or if they would have won any of them they would have been\nIn the post season so that's what we did last year\nIt's different when you come up one morning show the world series because now you don't have this one hundred and sixty two game palate to go really take a look at because\nBasically they accomplished everything they could have ... could potentially accomplish over the course of a hundred and sixty two games a hundred and sixty three games they won more games than anybody else in\nThe national league so you can't really nit pick anything that happened in the course of the regular season\nBut you can nitpick you know so yes you can nit pick the heck out of it\nAnd that's what you do you look at those moments over the course of a season there over the course of a series I should say\nThat really determine whether or not the team was going to be a playoff squander All right so where do you move forward now how do I've got a I've got a philosophy that I applied to football and I'm going to try to apply it\nTo baseball in terms of how you approach and off season and I'll explain that next it's brewers weekly we roll on and just a moment on WGM ...\nGood morning students please open your cheese education books to page twelve in honor of Jesus himself every Packers fan dream to be in the

P. A. U. L. E. Y. on air I I've been thinking about\nThis and I kind of ... really pushed me into thinking about this was the changes that were made today on the coaching staff\nToo darn cold resigning now sometimes guys resign and they're they're kind of asked to leave and sometimes guide resign and it's their own thing I got no inside information on this with coal is the fact that on the same day they announced that we tunnels contract\nIs not being renewed uh ... basically the brewers said they did not ask\nA lead tunnel back where a darn out coals resigned I feel like\nIf if they were not going to bring back turnout polls they would be treating the the release in in the verbiage of the way they announced that the same way that they deal with ... tunnel I I don't know if that's true or not that's just kind of\nHow I sense things but that being said it got me thinking so in football I've got an asteroid was surprised that I actually have some philosophies on some things\nI've got this philosophy when it comes to especially NFL teams in the post season\nI think that if you're an NFL team and stick with me here I Know this is a British show I've got a philosophy that if you're an NFL team and you get to the post season but you don't win the super bowl that you look\nAt the flaws that became very clear in the game that you lost that injure season\nAnd you address that that's the number one thing I ... issues that may be exist over the sixteen games season issues that may be existence and earlier postseason games not that you ignore those but whatever it was the killings heal that knocks\nYou out that that is your season I think that's what teams should focus on in the offseason going into the next seats so I tried to apply that standard to major league baseball and it's different it's clearly different\nStaying the same as you're going through the rebuilding process that was important that help this team move forward art so there's that imaginary line they crossed that line\nAnd they become a postseason team not only do they crossed that line and become a postseason team\nThey cross that line being a legit World Series contender having the most wins in the national league and coming up one wins short of the world series going to a game seven of the and I'll see us now all of a sudden you start looking at the team a little bit differently\nNow all of a sudden you're valuing different things\nYeah it's it's kind of the same as\nThree years ago when they were redoing the roster and the off season going into Craig counts as first full season as manager going into David Stern first year as general manager I mean it was ... it was taken a bomb to the entire organization\nAlmost that that roster and that forty man roster it just it completely turned over\nBecause that's what they had to do at that point that's what you needed to do to start positioning the team to winning you want to do that now you're not going to go to Troy Christian yells while you're not going to trade Lorenzo Cain away you're not going to uh go send all these guys away you don't do that now this is the\nThe team has evolved to a certain point where what you did three years ago is not what you do now and I think\nYou can apply that same standard to the motivation for these coaching changes to three over the last few years the value of having a consistent message from the same voices was really important\nWell that not that that's not important\nBut that's not most important anymore they're at a point where you can sit there and say you know what\nWe we want different voice in the bullpen we just we want our pictures out there to hear something else\nIt's a it's important to have a little bit of a shake up on the staff to get some new voices in there now when they're one wins short of the world series you can say okay that's we've all to a point where that's most important okay so from hitting standpoint\nWe we don't know how much of a choice it was for darn of calls to resign and how much maybe he was\nAsked to move on either way you can now say okay we need somebody who can help us get to a point of being a better situational hitting team there is some tweaks that we want and hitting coach three years ago those tweaks don't matter they matter now\nSo you can start focusing in more on the small stuff\nWhen when you're a bad T you got to focus on the big stuff when you're a really good team you have focused on the small stuff\nThe inches here in the interest there that are the difference between you losing game seven of\nThe ... and all cs and getting to the world series and that's what this team is addressing now and coaching changes it's a part of it so not an indictment on ... not an indictment on lead tunnel\nBut from a big picture perspective the fact that staff consistency\nIs now taking a back seat to some small tweaks that they want to make\nIt just continues to show the evolution of this team as they've gone through the last few years for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one six twenty it's the accident mortgage talking tax on you can tweet in as well ... on air\nBrewers weekly

J. carries presented by birth bank financial center\n[noise]\nKeeping [noise]\nToday's car great just moment is a special morning to you your life and your house could be at risk was certain dietary supplement [noise]\n\nCollege this moment [noise]\nThere's a new report out in the journal of the American Medical Association that a large number of dietary supplements that were subject to recall last year are still being sold on store shelves\nAnd still being sold on the Internet these items are extremely dangerous and I in fact the wording in the journal the American Medical Association these products have the potential to cause severe adverse health effects\nI mean that's as clear as it could possibly be for somebody writing about medicine right and these supplements that are being sold that are very dangerous\nFit into three particular areas where items are being sold with extremely dangerous ingredients and then that can lead to heart trouble high blood pressure a number of things and they're most heavily\nA dietary supplements being sold to people that are trying to do a weightlifting build up muscle mass\nPeople they're trying to lose weight\nAnd people that are trying to help themselves in the bedroom and so those three areas which are that's one that's a pretty large segment those three of the dietary supplement industry\nAnd what I can recommend is what I've recommended in the past is that you buy dietary supplements that are us pi raided\nThat it's an organization that has a voluntary code of conduct in the absence of\nFDA oversight based on a law passed by Congress last decade dietary supplements industry operates removed from and protected from normal safety oversight and only after the fact that leads to recalls\nDoes the FDA have any power over dietary supplements so in other words people after suffer medical harm before there's any action but in this case where there's been action\nThe companies selling dietary supplements or like we're not going to recall them where they can do is anyway and they're still for sale\nWe are posting at Clark dot com the list of ingredients specifically you want to make sure you are not taking in dietary supplements for any of these three purposes again weight loss\nFor for weight lifting or building up muscle mass you're listening to the Clark Howard\nSo yeah you will face potentially higher interest rates but you can dial back the clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union\nHe will likely drive the interest straight back to below what it would have been at a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic between a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and bank\nThe other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a vehicle I\nWant you to use the online methods to shop for a vehicle if you're a member of one of the big warehouse cubs Costco and Sam's they both have car buying programs no negotiation and the marketplace\nSoftness is directly reflected in the pricing you'll see from those programs superior usa a member I Want you to look to buy a vehicle through their program\nUsed cars are completely different process\nI'll talk about that at a future time but the key with a new vehicle or ranger financing and advance preferably at a credit union and second do your shopping online\nNot add a dealer the only thing you should be doing other dealers test drives and taking delivery I've got a guy that car dot com that walk she through this fine process\nAnd one of the thing about transportation I keep forgetting that mentioned Hoover and left are offering free rides on election day\nIf you would like to have them do the driving for you to the polling place\nInstead of you having to drive to the polling place\nBail is with us on the Clark Howard Ito hollow Dale\n... Ben I'm doing great thanks how are you are to\nThis I Am thank you\nSo you've got a question for me that how you're doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nThey may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nBig question concerns about taking Social Security at a sixty two and possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher amount a later age I feel like with the right of investment you probably wouldn't be doing better off than we chose\nA sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like an old chunk of change\nYour government handle and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nStunner is at what investments earned today what savings earn today it is nearly impossible\nFor someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the putative advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur your cost of living adjustment of space for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it in my case you know what age I'm going to take it\nEarly age Seventy that's the last time you could take it and get all that build up of the eight percent products my extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to a hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it\nSo you gave the ah you gave the analogy of sixty two and your retirement age which you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nPlanning on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm Still feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's going to stop me soon so probably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of\nWell but good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to live in years to regain the money that I like go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but\nThe big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement\nWhen we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother it will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know we are not a genetically disposed to live as long as guys in my family so can you imagine I'm going to wait until late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nThe mother that's over Ninety eight inches still kicking so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waiting because what you're really concerned about is way down the road\nSo I Hope that my brother uh who also\nWaited 'til age Seventy that he ends up women are really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money noble is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how're you doing\n... ... talk to you I'm well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company where did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit card or as a ... and those are not uh I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars nothing no or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nIf I didn't use the card by December ... that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if it would be\nIn my best interests that I guess in my credits best interests I close the cart before then or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases in the store\nThere is no real advantage to you having that if you have you ever sufficient credit elsewhere abuses MasterCard's American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nCard I Would dump it\nJust I'm just like them kicking the curb in December and be done with them because there's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry is junk credit right and you're not intending\nTo use it again so what is it just walk away\nOkay it it did have a ... a is a\nOne man I Want you to keep it should go keep it leaves some purchase somewhere\nOr whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card poker then it stays as active in part of your overall credit mix but when it was just\nA way that I think is referred to as a minor line where it's just for that particular store right those you don't want to have\nAll right well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the goal and I've been a big fan for years they very much\nFor your time to say that thank you so much you're listening to the Clark Howard

got a new technique yet another one for you to use when you love to travel [noise] can you just\nWant to know what deals there are so let's talk about you ripping yourself off\nThere's a new study that's been published by Deloitte regard consulting outfit and they found that people doing four O. one K. loans\nDecimate your future financial security and retirement\nIt's very common bit employers will make it super easy for you to do alone from their four one K. plan and the philosophy of employers historically has been\nHey if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nWhen they're going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one K. loans\nBut the thing is when you do that\nThose loans dramatically reduce\nHow much money you have down the road\nAnd in fact you may find that you will have to do away your retirement years down the road\nThat you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings\nFrom that four one K. loan that's even when you pay the loan back and you may wonder how could that be\nOK home equity line of credit would be much cheaper to set up and we'd have more flexibility you don't have to worry about the federal rules or you can do that now you don't have to wait\nTill he's sixty two\nAnd then you would have to service the interest on it for typically a ten year period and then after ten years that's when principle that you would have borrowed we'd have to start being paid back but it's a much more efficient way to access money\nThan to do so through a reverse mortgage\nRight I mean it's not something thinking about her you know like I said that hadn't eighty seven to ten years by okay well in that timeframe yeah\nYeah so again at that time depending on your financial circumstances it still might be a better idea\nTo do a home equity line of credit than it would be to do a reverse mortgage Travis is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Travis high court so you want to build up some money for yourself and there's something you're intrigued by what is

Wondering purchases at the gas station a store or wherever else around you and yours dollar so and change and then put it put it into I guess the stock market and I don't notice it\nIt's not likely going in investing in line myself I just don't even notice it coming out of like how it's a giant times\nSo it's it's like saving without even on you're doing it\nThe fees for you doing it I think there are twelve a year twelve dollars a year\nShe acting sightings of dollars a month\nYeah so it's a great opportunity if you feel like there's never any spare money to save and invest for your future so great way for you to get it done\nYeah uh what I was ... ... is there any better or right now it says I'm putting about eighty two hundred dollars give or take each month into it and I

gonna give you your money back they keep your money no matter what it is you can have a terrible health story you tell them\nYou can have a horrible loss of somebody's life in your family cruise lines ... their hearts at support say will not help you no matter what so you gotta buy trip insurance can usually it'll be about six cents on the dollar value of the cruise\nSo how much what is your five night proof [noise]\nWe're not going to believe that five hundred and Seventy dollars football\nSo with that kind of price you're talking about about no money at all for Cruz insurance [noise] gosh probably thirty some odd dollars there there's a website I like Peter compare policies that it's called a measure my trip dot com\nOkay have you been to ensure my trip they all have a variety of policies you can choose from and how long ago did you work your crews found three weeks ago\nOkay that's very important because when you look at policies for\nA lot of them will not pay off for a medical issue here thinking in any way to show it was pre existing tape you failed or by within depending on the policy Tanner fourteen days so get all over this and check out\nWhat exclusion say have\nSince it's been a couple of weeks since she booked\nAnd again ensure my trip dot com is my favorite place for you to do that shopping\nJoe let's see if we can sneak in and ask Clark here ... ... and he says I'm In the market for a new flat screen TV de ... vice on where I should look to get the best deal\nMy best advice to get the best deal is by unknown name TV not so much the store you buy it out but the\nBe not so much the store you buy it out but the by what's called a third level or white label TV brand that is or who knows what branded as the reliability the TV's has been so good\nAcross friends\nBiggest screen size you can put it in your house\nTo the Clark Howard show\nWhat do you think about estimates nation presented by liberty mutual insurance liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need so why aren't more things in life customize them on why isn't a burger cheaper when you ask for no one\nAnd so if you are a member of a credit union and you never really thought about the whole car loan thing and you're carrying alone go check and see if there is a deal they can make for you it'll just save your money\nThe worst that happens is they say no it's not going to be a deal for you the best that happens as you're saving money each and every month\nJeremy's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jeremy\nHi Clark thanks for taking my question\nI'm Glad to do so you want to talk credit cards\nI knew so my question actually ah pertains to uh we use credit cards is a a payment system especially ones that give us good cash back towards that are on rotating categories and a\nWhile you have more license than I Do I got to tell you Jeremy I can't my brain cannot process rotating categories of rewards\n[laughter] ... getting used to and I will say that I think you refer to them at the back of the wallet cards I call it a couch cards because we use this one card a long time ago to my couch and all day so I got I got an offer in the mail for ten percent cash back for a certain category so I I definitely jumped on that but\nMy question is is all these nice cards at ease these categories a wife is kind of the gang and Ali yang and I'm online payments here and so she's in the atmosphere so she would be using potentially apple pay a and I would be the Android Pay for the more frugal side there\nAnd my question is when you use alternative payment processors a navy those payments are those charges are not going to be reflected as the correct category and so my question is is is if you use apple pay your Android Pay\nWhen those charges go through or are they gonna show because apple pay rent pay are they going to show up at a grocery chain where I get a certain amount of\nKenya they'll show up at the chain see with ... with apple pay an Android Pay what they both do is they create\nA safer payment environment\nBecause they're using far more sophisticated technology to transmit a payment than what the banks use\nWith their credit cards so it's more secure platform\nWhen she pays with apple paying you pay with Android Pay and all it is is is the trans it's the way the payment information is transmitted to the store you're paying so it should have the zero effect\nOn you getting those reward bonuses and the rotating categories\nOkay great and you know that if there was any problem you'd know that right away\nBecause here first statement would show that you and uh you probably have to call customer know servicing get credited to the right category but I I've never heard of anybody having a problem where it did not properly migrate to the right category using\nA Samsung Pay apple pay Android Pay who knows who else is pay\nOkay great that answered my question than\nI have a great day Andrea is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrea how're you doing today\nI think such a like a\nSure was great to have you here you have something that isn't as great as you like you have student loans to deal with\nIdea around here and it's like come on guys out of ... ...\nS going around theory finance law currently I Am trying but I have a plan of thoughts hand because that might encounter that ratio um you know currently with my part time and I\nDo need a whole diner on metal out so I was wondering what your thoughts are should I wait for the for trying to start re financing for like income to that ratio is not what it is now or should I\nTake out you know 'cause I I had my parents will fail it'd be caused by and I think they were asking about like a temporary life insurance plan if I were\nI mean like in a crowd like if\nI get I don't want to be out of you to part of that stuff on your client thought all\nRight so let's go back a step Andrea your loans that you have that you've had a since he got out two years ago where they federal or private\nNot fighting federal um I have about navy uh Eighteen thousand private\nAnd how much total in federal would you guess\nOkay now claims too much but it's about Seventy eight\nOkay so that's actually good you want much more if not all federal and as little as possible private so the federal loans you don't want to coal mingle with the private in any kind of re fi\nOkay so the federal loans tend to have decent interest rates you know because years would be a various rates were raised or on your various federal\nAnywhere from like three and a half four point eight I think as a ...\nOkay so if the lower ones there's no way you'd want to look at re fi you don't need a co signer for any of those ... who's six point eight by standards of recent years this was an undergraduate loans not graduate\nOkay because the graduates are probably the ones that are six point eight but the thing with the federal is you can take your federal loans and have them under the direct federal program known as revised pay as you earn\nOkay and under that program they'll loan payment you are required to make is automatically adjust it up or down based on your income so the fact that you're working part time you may not have any obligation to make payments at all and still be considered to be current\nOkay so the federal loans you don't want to take them and migrate them to any kind of private refinance okay in addition with a federal loans what is that you do for a job what kinds of field haven't\nI'm not a veterinarian okay I don't know it is veterinary medicine\nA field that gets you loan forgiveness after ten years\nI think of as\nOkay so otherwise it would be twenty typically\nIf you're under revised pays you earn like if your income uh doesn't climb\nBy a very large amount and you're paying is required under revised pay as you earn your loan balances forgiven eventually on the federal okay so that's why you don't want to co mingled those at all\nI see okay\nAnd by the way I Know this means you're an ultra brilliant person because it's much harder to get into veterinary medicine school than it is in the traditional medical school\nI don't know about the brilliant part [laughter]\nSo on the private loans what interest rates that they carry\nI not sure if I could tell you that right after\nRight so until you get your arms around what kind of rates you have in terms on the private loans you know I wouldn't do anything moving forward with doing any kind of re fi or anything like that but I the only loans you would want to consider refined are those private ones\nAnd maybe you do you wait until you have the full time gig is a veterinarian and then you don't have the income to support refine on your own without your parents then you don't have to get into that thing that makes them uncomfortable\nOkay I'm going out there I go full time should I feel that federal\n... loans on their own but again move them if they're not already move them into revised pay as you are\nWelcome okay alright best to you as a vet asked thanks I might say everything\nYou there I'm sure but by Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show host Tom\nHi\nTom you want to talk about L. E. cheese yeah I got the ...\nL.

can remember the last roller coaster I was on this was at a at Opry land as I recall and they have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred sixty degree\nA thing as kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our guests to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second [laughter] do you do you know what ride that was\nYes I Do actually is one of the first rise I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which is just\nGave you exactly that that was a while Bosch I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little uh the one that one little area but\nYes I'm very familiar with it and now a in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course Opry land with a great place to put an amusement park right next to\nThe er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating\nUh I must be ... it definitely woke me up I remember that that we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers are over there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a a little bit tired at this point and and uh\nIt woke me up Yes sir that there'll be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did\nWas actually called the ... if I really\nDo all that uh well anyway I put it this way it did lead me say this is off will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a guest of the park I got to ride for free okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really victim again of course that's that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPete drove you go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually a A N I'm In law actually started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that comes in light of course the universal studios\nAll went to their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse and\nSo the place where again have to be totally scared and and ah you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween now I guess a parking off instead\nDisney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and then of course you got the booty you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks happy hollow wishes or over the all the uh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned that that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations have that right at\nWhich is your Claire classic scares own all\nYou know where you go into these mazes and stuff like that so we're in this that the sewer souls and now which is layer and in places like that and of course the the point has got hollow our weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or that that that goes on there are ... high school showed entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into the big time uh I mean even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll plus they changed the names of the rights of times\nUh for example over at scare winds uh which is a Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina all they've got an actual weight street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows\nIn zombies in and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters from a lot of the novels a\nGreat place to go so that there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen odd that actually do this or and or they're just a you know the rise are still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid gloves scary rides\nAll the good thing about all these places where they were universal studios knots berry farm which is in a that's not going to basically Anaheim all we mentioned the fight fast and the fan of light over Kenny would a hell of a screaming Williamsburg\nTampa Busch Gardens are and of course ... and he's not so scary Halloween all these places that was mentioned plus others\nUm during the day you know during the day is it really is it like that or it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and there's ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places you have kids and they're and they're pretty fighting\nOr you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zone\nWhere you'll you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or will tell you it it it is easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are are just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or having a kid had a traumatic experience with that\nSort of the way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer [noise]\nNaturally I mean yeah the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and now there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know they're they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe you're a teenage gal\nAh or something along those lines so you know there are different mark and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and they know it ... if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I liked uh he's in he's in parts of what they do and how they train people\nIn order to make sure that it is a very good experience for her many uh and again there are there are there are scarce zone than their non scare zones or not you know if you're going to scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nOr not I don't know what are we back them to take a look at that a greater detail in just a moment\nHe's really where every Sunday [noise]\nA amusement parks have decided\nThat uh if you have something for everyone a show for the older people rides for the younger people kitty rides and and little shows for a younger people have food that pretty much anyone can try\nWhether it be fast food or actual sit down restaurants or you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together\nA and enjoy a day I mean even the older people or you've got scooters that can go are you know around with the scooters\nAnd I have to worry about the walking you know the miles as they say four miles on average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that uh that means imports and not just geared for kids anymore they're good for all family members and that's why they do so well\nSo it was more to compete tribute go an expert on travel and amusement parks and look at some things besides the those are the frightening actually tonight one eight six six Bible jumbo when

track never actually really moves\nWhat happens is you actually have you with a three D. or or D glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment uh that looks like it's actually moving for example soaring is a classic example over at Disney where you think are actually on hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that is all happening so the simulation right take a much smaller footprint there are a little less money but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes and it pretty much all goes away\nInteresting\nAh is viewed by the way I've never experienced these are these a virtual environments where they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that to the number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of these thrill rides a emulate a a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters up front about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because of their life since then and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you did mention ah like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example a or different events like track of course the movie you'll find the universal studios\nBut as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on is that nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense what you do is you put on these or the glasses and they cover your entire face\nA wire going through a small a roller coaster and feeling the wind and the reason to your face\nOr what you're getting as you're actually getting a simulation rider or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour and goes up and down maybe a little bit\nIs now more intense or so that seems to be another way that they're\nRevamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from Rita in Dallas on the jumbo have showed one eight six six five oh

and\nTwelve mailed from Florida all with similar devices similar packaging bubble wrap crude explosive device again air quotes on explosive because thankfully nothing has happened to any of these devices are that's the latest on that started Monday with the ah\nTurn down the domes incorporate new building and the museums into that building a location location location one of the touch your son Justin from the two six to\nThe proposal sounds cool and relatively financially proven but rather see a new museum in the lake front so we can have a music museum district down there like Chicago and many other cities ideally that would include a scaled down perhaps single horticultural dumb\nBut I Know that would be cost prohibitive last weekend solicits significant private funding perhaps from some of the new large area companies like Foxconn an Amazon together is good\nBut not a metro part I agree with Justin actually\nI Love the idea of the lake front museums\nNow because Chicago does it just I think it's a visually striking look the art museum the ...\nThe veterans areas of the park along the way locating a single don't think we need to get away from the three idea 'cause that's that's so expensive uh single dome a new Milwaukee museum\nThere are significant investments that can be gleaned from the private communities those donors who care about cultural institutions\nDoesn't have to be taxpayer funded it certainly could be but I think that's one of the things that we might look at\nI'm Jeff from Fox point um look look to do a good graduate study for some of the programs such as land use education I W Steven's point lots of great ideas out there young people certainly have a lot of great ideas there's a lot of potential here but I think you have to be\nPrudent and how he looked at this money is a factor where'd you get the latest from ABC um the packages the or devices center Cory Booker and James Clapper that's coming up right now for maybe see\nThe list of the package is growing more found today as we hear from ABC's Eva pilgrim in the Miami Dade\nArea and that that our ten year old in on the postal sorting facility here in South Florida overnight and I live in Pakistan here in Florida dislike addresses senator Cory Booker the New Jersey senator isn't really all different from a twelve pack of this out at a post office in New York this morning\nWind addressed a former director of national intelligence James Clapper all of this parking real concern there could still be more packages out there\nJames Clapper telling CNN he is not intimidated by the package that\nWas addressed to him that was found today\nThis was not going to a silence on a\n... a\nProminent Democrat and Trump critics have been the target of all twelve packages none of the devices has exploded in federal agents are investigating who sent them monitor whether you're on ABC News\nThat's the latest on the devices the packages sent out across the country are you know gene and I were talking to you know we're talking this morning whether these ... the same time I believe that could be because it takes a while to travel through the system\nI think the focus now at least ... that's when the reports I'm reading of the Florida mail facility is is a is a source of interest place of interest for investigators\nYou can rest assured we got the best people looking at this case this is a serious\nIssue when it comes to safety domestic terrorism political tourism wherever you want to call it it was interesting to hear the words of James Clapper there are saying he will not be Detroit as a critic with all respect to James Clapper that's not the point I think the point of yours is public safety\nThe politics of it I could care less about yes these are directed at democratic leaders are people who have been critical this administration\nBut the bottom line is mail carriers mail handlers in somebody to process his mail for elected officials are all put at risk if one of these devices would go off so it's less about politics more about safety and security at this point\nWill continue to follow that story will give you updates as necessary as provided but that's the latest James Clapper\nCory Booker the now the eleventh and twelfth recipients of packages directed as I said towards democratic leaders or people critical of the administration concerning topic right now we're talking about the museum and the domes\nWhat should happen in Milwaukee where do you want to see happen with those buildings in those facilities lake front Mitchell park\nWas

see it across Milwaukee\nThe state in the world and as I said uh we've been covering extensively the latest on this uh\nPackages situation now the eleventh and twelfth mailed out the Cory Booker senator from New Jersey and a former national intelligence director James Clapper he has comedy comes on and I haven't seen comments from Cory Booker senator Booker\nYet [noise] all critics\nAt least those two of the presidents of the United states she's she is in ... have been commenting he's pushing back against the media as the president or as as a ... like likes to do um because he says they're saying that he's part of the story um\nTo a minor degree that might be the case but I think for the most part the media just on a fairly decent job of covering the details of this case which are in my mind political terrorism somebody is trying to cause terror\nBy directing these things so far democratic leaders are people critical of this president's we'll find out what the what the details are who's responsible at some point I'm confident of that given law enforcement's ability to track these things\nAre just about to wrap on our conversation about the Milwaukee public museum the domes proposal by supervisor ... marine at the meet your average to move the new museum right next to the Central Park domes Mitchell park\nUm interesting idea\nWe're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars when you combined the domes whether new facility or the Ninety five up to Ninety five million dollars would cost to fix the current domes and then you put a price tag on the Milwaukee museum moving that purchasing property it's got to be more than a hundred million dollars as well so two hundred plus million dollars\nAnd while I understand what supervisor Dimitri averages saying bigger Boulder better I'm all for that\nBut the public ... public in the county have limited assets and the women ability to fund these kinds of proposals now the thing that always comes up when you talk about institutions like this and I've had this in in a smaller sense in my previous life as a mayor\nWhy should the only the people living and paying taxes now carry the burden for those who use the facilities many years generations outs that's the tricky one\nThe legacy of these buildings goes out way past the debt load required to pay for these updates or replacements\nShould not be a system that says says look for people that are forty years out they're going to using their facilities should they not\nHave to chip in and that's one of the ways you could probably do this has to find these things long term like you would a home or another large purchase so there there's a lot of angles and elements of these stories what I Love to see a new market museum absolutely I like the current one\nWas there last year beautiful facilities are always updating and always doing new things with the space has limited storage elements of all the things that they have\nDon't allow for the display of a lot of the cool stuff that the marquee museum could show the public you know what to do inside these our facilities now that our generations old\nAnd while they're spectacular buildings architecturally they stand out in the skyline when you're driving on the freeway\nBecause it makes sense to have three or could you build one dome in the future of ruin replays and would it makes sense to spend Ninety five million dollars to repair the current ones tough decisions for market county\nWith complete Republican control you kind of just see the inherent dysfunction of of Congress as it is currently made up and how it functions\nOr doesn't function I I think I think what Democrats will do is is they will uh there's gonna be a lot of investigations are they're going to exercise their oversight role you're going to see a lot of subpoenas you're going to see investigations into Trump's taxes or into administration officials this that and the other thing\nUm how serious those investigations are I don't know but that's that's similar to what Republicans did when they got and I think you might see some compromises on things like infrastructure um you might see some compromises uh it's they've they've been getting along pretty well and doing bipartisan legislation on opioids and heroin crisis\nSo there are things where they can work together but if you think there's going to be some big tax bill or immigration reform ah I think better I think that's probably not in the cards and and this was all set up for it kind of\nThe trench warfare heading into

belief that they couldn't explode I'm calling I mentioned before the break up the um oh I Want to get to this the president coming in Wisconsin but we're talking about civility during that commercial break and\nYou can be civil liberties civil but doesn't serve a purpose and and are we are we spit or wheelchair trying to talk about civility when maybe that's not the answer\nYeah I think there's a

election is the most important and that that that is so much at stake\nAnd there is a lot at stake and we and we can have passionate and interesting discussions about policy but but you know when you when you have Hillary Clinton saying you know what civility has to take a back seat\nBecause this election is so important so much is at stake or when you go back two years ago uh you know among Republicans and conservatives there was a line about this with the flight Ninety three election you know rush the cockpit or we die\nA you know this this type of stuff\nUm it it raises the stakes I think unnecessarily um and that isn't going to that is going to put civility in the back seat and I very much fear that until\nSomething puts this in perspective until something breaks the fever where we do realize that and we can disagree about immigration taxes health care and we can we can do so in a way that isn't going to lead to some awful consequences I'm I'm Amazed this week as we talk about these packages that\nThat is so little so quickly we forgot about you know what occurred with Steve ... congressmen on a on a softball field just a year ago I mean the almost was an unprecedented mass assassination Republican congressmen and yet\nYou know a seemingly so easily forgotten\nThat didn't happen yeah ... and I think we're at this point not to use it ... explosion or analogy but do things literally have to explode before you can actually see a decline in some of this instability in some of this intense hate filled rhetoric\nI certainly hope not I hope we can avoid that and for some perspective we're talking off air I mean I I read a statistic this morning that between ... and an Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one in Nineteen Seventy two they're

they you know last week it was short with high school but it it could be somewhere ... somewhere in Oregon and you're talking about you're thinking about it and we're all talking about it so\nI'm so there's an element of just mass media that that seems to elevate a these controversies and maybe even heightened divisions that don't necessarily always exists\nWhile you're reading of east really right you're right it's just incredible drive for information and and and as you feed your own personal narrative the freeze your own pursuit of truth truth being your own defined version of truth I think it can be dangerous long term and\nI'm not sure how you get to an end game here other than the fact that if you keep calling every election the most important election ever\nAt some point that's not going to be true and I don't know what how that happens\nWell and how do people react to it so if if if Trump is literally Hitler you know if we we've heard this type of stuff before what if the Democrats don't take the house\nWhat is it what if they don't win in the next week or so well what does that do to someone who's who's who perhaps doesn't have a lose lose looser grip with reality you who believes when they say hey hey you know the Republicans are going to kill people with their health care reforms or they're going to kill people would their tax forms\nYou know that there is a

location location location and it it's a huge problem in terms of taxes is taking these are most of these are um are our tax refunds from prior years so that's taking cash money out of the municipalities tens of giving it back to the manufacturer\nAnd you and I know you just don't work that way you why don't we know money's pretty tight and local budgets now that you have to cut a check going backwards or to now having all of a less amount of money to to do the business of government makes it really challenging but the biggest story line is it affects the the individual taxpayer\nAbsolutely takes the money and shifted back on them because they continue to pay taxes on their assessed value I just last week were served by Wal Mart Sam's Club and monarchs\nAnd when I was just looking for a forty five percent reduction in the value they're building\nA missed the story I always tell people they built a building for Thirteen million dollars on higher and under well traveled scraped retail six thirty million bucks we've been assessment of about ten and a half million for the last\nFive or six years never once did they can test their assessment now they're suing us they want their assessment to be five point four million dollars it's just unconscionable\nAnd John as a as a business a CEO ... your take on on that issue\nI I don't really understand it I don't understand the logic behind it certainly if you are selling a building and you you had a lease or the town of the buildings worth more than a an abandoned building so I don't understand the logic of it as a taxpayer\nI mean I Know in my ... and I know the challenges I'm familiar with the challenges that we have as a municipality held challenge that they are\nWith the I'm trying to pay for increased cost year after year with a property tax levy that's frozen\nAnd then to take it away I I don't know how the math works out I'm a taxpayer and I I just I just don't understand the logic of it and I don't think it's appropriate thing to do\nWell John I got good news for your [laughter] your city is spending almost a million dollars is attorney fees to defend itself and that is just outrageous ...\nPoints where we are I mean you're you're more plug in and then I used to be into what what are lawmakers I I'm sure local leaders are telling lawmakers day state legislature what they need to do I've ever I've involved on the show he's not buying the ... war selling it when it comes to local community so wars is going to play out\nWell that's exactly the issue there's huge bipartisan support to fix both of these issues a\nBipartisan both sides right and the number of people in the ... the number of legislators signed off on that is probably a record a for single piece of legislation actually two pieces of legislation it all stops at leadership in the Senate and Robin for us they refused to bring it to a vote\nI and I don't you know I checked\nThe speakers are donations list WAMC is not on it so I Can't believe that at it and I don't know what his reasons for\nNot wanting to go to a vote but uh he's impacting his taxpayers Burlington just get a suit by I Believe I Believe it was when I Can't say that for sure but so his constituents are now getting hurt\nOr you are you maybe you're not to this point yet but at some point individual taxpayers are paying their property tax bills are going to notice something in the ... noticed is going to be that they're going to be paying more to basically have the same amount of services in her community\nYeah a mess for the numbers on what really is the number for an individual taxpayer Ben Franklin has a risk right now three hundred and forty four thousand dollars in taxes based on the lawsuits that we're currently ... just settled\nAnd just to know their number the Franco public school district is ... is about to pay out out of this if they are all success will hundred and fifty one thousand dollars\nAnd that's to teachers that's that's big numbers in Franklin is going to be Seventy five thousand outta that that is a police officer\nYeah which is a whole other conversation about the impact on public safety which is significant is why we're seeing a lot of the referendum is that we're seeing out there um I guess CEO of grave John Kissinger mayor Franklin's evils and

outstanding city of Franklin Wisconsin It's hard for me to say they're still trying to be so kind I Want to talk about this make until he started briefly I Know a lot of time but um well she Adeline but should have gotten fired John\nYou know it's easy to say well this is just political correctness gone wrong but I think if you look at it\nShe had some other incidents in the past where saying that Santa Claus was white and Jesus was white and going after the new Black Panthers when she was at Fox all I can see somebody at NBC saying I don't know if she's reliable the next time who knows what she's going to say so I don't know that\nTime who knows what she's going to say so I don't know that it was just political correctness gone wrong I think um yeah I I think if you look at our whole track record she might just about judge Judy too unreliable to be on the air\nLooking I saw a bit of it in context I didn't think it was that bad she shouldn't have said it by any means you should not have said it but I didn't think it was bad enough to um get the outrage but frankly actually this is a corporate are looking for a way to get rid of her and this is their excuse and they're going to do it\nShe was always a mismatch I think uh uh NBC I we're talking in during the break about the fact that it seems very clear to me the way they do their business in New York and I always chat about the fact that they send their their host to these exotic locations always like\nAnd I was just said you know we can't even teach this or put on a production because it is controversial\nSo it's a teaching moment that was lost in the whole shuffle I think you're absolutely right and\nIf I was involved in that situation is like you or not but you make a decision you stand by your decision and you show a little back on and I don't think any of that came from the school district and they should have taking charge of the issue they should let them play go on but should have also had a discussion about race before or after it and make it part of the curriculum\nThe amazing thing to me is that they they were at this point when they knew probably months if not a year ahead of time because it was production did you not expect this controversy there are school districts in our state that don't allow that book to be taught\nOr they're going to not do the macadam as it probably makes makes light of the Asians as he does is gone amongst its way too far\nI think all of us wish that they I mean it's up all of a movie of all of a book for people of our generation we all wish that it would have happened I don't know that a Charlotte's highschool responsibility to fix the race problems in our community and I think they do have a responsibility for students to maintain a safe environment so\nIt's very unfortunate the way it happened but I don't know what I Would have just\nPlowed through myself I let me just take a quick break when we come back and ask the question I

J.\nHi Paco taking the call I\nSat on the committee that sounds like a busy\nStreet in Cincinnati that rightly Ninety\nAnd we decided at that time not go forward with it because of weathering condition that well it was right it was an issue uh when I got to give a shout out so I don't want to be tried for stepping up and taken on\nThat risk because there are no operational\nBecause southeastern Wisconsin as wrapped around Chicago north\nEastern quadrant of Michigan it's very very unique weather\nHere that you know we're nowhere else\nYeah ice ice has been a huge problem in Cincinnati needed yeah and but\nBut here it's going to be it's going to be high and if you know you hear people saying well you know because it's already been proven to be a major problem but it\nWas you know the ...\nYou're right and I think the last guy I'm kind of a good Scott you're you're actually right that this will be the the story as well right it's you know they say maybe snow isn't as disruptive but ice is a killer and yes we we have ice in\nAnd yeah it's Portland, Oregon you can tell it's just great Portland it's not a problem we're not Portland, Oregon and you're right we're not Kansas City either I continue to believe\nTen years from now ten years from now this is going to be again a completely failed line and what's going to happen is you're going to have new political powers in line and they are going to say okay this is Tom berets idea it was a failure could be wrong we'll see twelve twenty AHL quicker pick\nFrom our urban centers burst principles George beautiful outdoor best of Wisconsin has something for everyone discover all the amazing adventures winning W hat on trial in Wisconsin with John McHugh on Saturdays\nWisconsin radio station wanting the GM Jay she calls and we used to [noise]\nBreaks it all down at seven seven\nOf this confidence morning news with gene mellow ... good morning shirt your mortgage even how you doing voice actors Wayne Larrivee before and after every day it was more than adequate he was good last year by international autos\nWell I think a lot of us aren't surprised he is now been charged in federal criminal complaint presumably he'll be indicted in the near future and he's been charged with trying to use the the dark Web to buy some form of radioactive elements\nThat he apparently told and undercover police FBI agent that he wanted to use to poison somebody and make it look like the person that contract of cancer or something it's just this weird sort of thing but now he's looking at life in prison if you were to have read many of the accounts of Jeremy Ryan\nYou would never have known that this guy was this far left wing capital protester and we we talked about that yesterday matter of fact you might have even thought he was a Republican because Ryan ran for\nRand for Paul Ryan seat\nAnd again hoping that people would be too stupid to realize that he wasn't Paul Ryan well he he actually got about six thousand votes in a Republican primary which does\nMake you kind of scratch your head but anyhow there's all this coverage of segue boy Jeremy Ryan who is you know out there and apparently was out there trying to buy some radioactive something to kill someone\nNow would I suggest then of course there's no question about this guy's been one of these out of control far left protesters would I suggest\nThat the reason his motivations for doing this because he's is unhappy political activists when\nI blame Hillary Clinton for what he did of course not or Tammy Baldwin are Gwen Moore or Jennifer ... I wouldn't I wouldn't blame any of them\nWhat happens here is Jeremy Ryan is a cook and he's been a coup for a long time he's been one of these far left radicals and I'm not surprised at the end of the day that he ended up\nMaybe a little bit surprised that this was what brought him down but I mean this guy's been a train wreck for years\nAnd I don't blame the political culture and I don't blame a hostile environment that's out there I mean he's just he he ... he's a cook and you know he got caught right now that having been said\nThey have now arrested\nA bomb suspect in southern Florida the U.S department of justice is going to be having a press conference one thirty our time we we will dip into this but the information is already starting to leak out now as we discussed yesterday some people were sick just stating\nThat OK maybe this is this is that this ultimate disinformation campaign and maybe there was some you know heavy duty left is that was trying to send out all these different pipe bombs to prominent Democrats in the vets and try to make Republicans look bad\nMy my philosophy when it comes to analyze and criminal behavior is that and much other type of behavior as well is that the simplest explanation is often the best\nAnd occasionally not but but most of the times\nIf it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it is probably a duck so as I said yesterday my inclination was this was going to be some right wing nut job and there are right wing nut jobs and there are left wing nut jobs\nWho was out there and it appears that at least based on preliminary reports that that's correct this is a right wing nut job now we don't know if he acted by himself or not my guess is is going to turn out to be a lone wolf by I could be wrong about that\nBut but here's what they're reporting about him now guys fifty six years old is saying the seas are say\nOf Evan tore up Florida that's just a little bit north of Miami so we're talking about South Florida I have the story in the New York times and they of course prominently point out that he is a registered Republican or get that out of the way at first he\nHas a lengthy criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One\nThat includes felony theft\nDrug and fraud charges he's also been arrested and accused of threatening to use a bomb according to public records\nSo I mean the bats are clearly flying out of this bill for his criminal record from the Florida department of law enforcement indicates that at the time of his last arrest the with which was a twenty Fifteen\nI'm his occupation is listed as a manager or whatever that means on friday morning of course at the time of the rescue perhaps seeing this if you looked at TV authorities had surrounded a white van with Trump stickers all over he's driving around and one of these bands that you see from time to time\nThat's just their bumper stickers all over at\nSeveral of which are\nDonald Trump pro Trump bumper stickers or pro I'm Mike Pence bumper stickers so that's what we know so far you've got All right a guy who\nGet registered Republican drive it around this ban with Trump stickers all over lake the criminal record including an arrest for threatening to use a bomb and okay so now he is in custody so it appears to me\nThat my inclination the guy was a right wing nut job it is what's coming through which I think was probably predictable at the time\nOur number for one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the acting it mortgage talk and text line\nLet's look at the larger question there is no doubt that we live in a charged political environment now you have Democrats who feel that they are part of the resistance that they can say anything that they want\n'em in urging people to opposed Donald Trump\nYou have people who feel we can walk up to Mitch McConnell when he's eating lunch or dinner in a restaurant\nAnd we can grab is food and throw it away we can confront people as part of the resistance and you know Hillary Clinton promotes that she says well we can't deal with these people as civil either there is a basket of deplorable Z on the flip side you have President Trump who gives as good as he gets no question about it\nPresident Trump who talks about fake news President Trump who has the various derogatory nicknames for people All right so you've got all this going on in both sides and you know here you have in this case this right wing nut job whose putting together crude pipe bombs and presumably trying to send them to um prominent Democrats [noise]\nIs it Trump's fault that somebody like this ... guy did what he did for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that see I get a mortgage talking text line All right let us assume that we are dealing with this right wing nut job\nWho decided this is the way that he's going to express himself by sending out pipe bombs which are nasty\nBy sending out pipe bombs which are nasty things is it fair to blame President Trump for this has he created this climate that led to a fees are say for one for seven nine nine one six twenty we discuss in just a minute if you're on the line to be sold on twelve forty

stuff like that so you I and I was like okay I Can't get caught in the polling line for forty five minutes because they just don't have that time given what I have to do and election day so I have early voting but I'm I'm with you I Love\nEverything about voting on the day of the election now I understand maybe that makes me sound kind of like Jimmy Stewart you know Mr Smith goes to Washington

charges and how they approach their jobs so that's all coming up on the show today Mike Nichols attempt thirty five to four at ten\nOr will be next and well of course lead off of the story of the day explosive devices either intercepted are found a formal George Soros\nThe home of the Clintons and are intercepted on their on their way to the White House so we are not a lot of details yet thankfully no one hurts a at this moment so that's all coming up or the next hour the four at ten right here in WTC engineer\nMorning Wisconsin's head on Saturday [noise] I just had a map vast down the hallway of resumes is a lot going on for a lot\nOf moving pieces a lot of moving parts and obviously the breaking news story is going to lead off her for that Senate explosive devices males\nSome cases are showing up at the home of George Soros and the home of the bill and Hillary Clinton that's number one of our force in the four biggest stars as we see it across Milwaukee the states and the world's CNN evacuated at one point while they were on the air Eric a\nNot a lot known about this yes well we know these certain figures were targeted\nThey quickly said that they believed they were linked to swell when we first heard about it it was the Clinton house then we heard about the Obamas\nAnd immediately they said they believed that these devices or whatever they happened to be we've heard pipe bomb we've heard explosive device whenever it may be which they also called rudimentary which means a very basic device\nI was linked to the George Soros situation yesterday he is the liberal financier who found that his compound some type of device\nOn my yesterday or maybe Monday or was um so now here we are now learning that a pipe bomb or some type of device was also sent to the White House it was an intercepted well before he even made it close to the White House\nAnd uh we await word from the president or other authorities here about what exactly these are where they are coming from all of that is still you have to be determined\nI read the statement from the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and and their condemning these attacks as you would expect a it's a it's not a ... there's no grey area here [noise]\nAnd and at this point we don't know a lot but they're they're clearly have always been threats to government figures that's why we have a secret service right we have we've had a white ex presidents\nAnd ex officials often carry on that protection way pass the time they're in office because there are people in this country that are intense on causing them harm\nAt this point motivation is not knowing motives are always difficult to determine anyway but we we do know that these devices had been sense are targeting the White House the Obamas the Clintons the Soros family as well\nIt's devices had been sense are targeting the White House the Obamas the Clintons Soros family as well and then does get one pause and when you think about the current state of affairs in this country and I know a couple of ... and say well how can you make that connection\nI'm not making that connection I'm saying given the current political climate\nIcy parallels between what happened in the Nineteen sixties and in some cases the assassinations and half of the Nineteen sixties John Kennedy Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd that was also a very tense time in our country it wasn't shocked me at all if we're seeing a ramping up of threats of violence while our current political situation is kind of unfolding mid term elections the ramp up to twenty twenty times are difference clearly\nI Would argue in some ways they're more volatile than they were in the Nineteen sixties ... as far as that is to say and belief but here we are we're talking about in this case explosive devices wrong\nI I think often times you don't realize the impact of rhetoric and again you can't we have no idea what the connection is if there even is one\nBut you you look back at this release shooting you remember that shooting during the baseball practice it didn't take long until rhetoric amped up again and things that are just said by a politician with just meant to make a a news cycle and make a sound bite oftentimes\nAdds to the intensity that the rest of the country has its it's true it just there's a deep hatred or at least the a deep\nEnergy for lack of a better word between the two sides red and blue right now and it's always been that way but now it's more than ever before and just the rhetoric add\nTo that I I think there's a case to be made that when you when you're going to the point where you're shouting down people who are just going out to dinner with their spouses or their families in restaurants in public places we have escalated that rhetoric to a point where people can't they can't even function anymore [noise]\nWe all know that mental health and mental illness or an issue in this country\nShouldn't surprise anybody and again we don't know the motives you don't know the background of who ever did this uh uh made these threats are sent these devices but it doesn't there's not a big leap of faith to suggest that when you have people that are unstable or showing signs of mental instability that they can go to the next level\nAnd that could be what we're talking about here and I think it's important to remember when you have conduct that rises to the level we've seen you mentioned Steve Congressman Steve Scully you mentioned\nPeople not being able to even go out to dinner with their spouse because people want to threaten them in restaurants or the attacks and pronounced made by even elected officials towards each other\nThe rhetoric they use all these things contribute to the climate in this country\nIsn't it interesting though that you just kinda automatically assume that this is some type of domestic situation that we do and the funny though like we wouldn't have thought that a couple of years ago but now it's like automatically just assume that some praise diluted take from within our own country that's doing\nYeah again we don't know anything about the motivation of
