{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "Well it's a very complete team I mean they they've got a lot of money they spent a lot of money a quake Kirsch as one of the best pictures and all they all have that's the last few years\nUm you know they got a really good starting rotation model left handed pitcher Walker dealers that alone right hander and that rotation but they've got a lot of lax these are run out there kind of neutral like black and it back to the brewers\nPut they've they may have been proven that the government and the child shortstop Brian ... who didn't do a whole lot but he crushed brewers they're that series\nAt the end of July and beginning of August a as a member of LA so um they they got some some good faith ... it's a very talented team I I think the brewers have an advantage in the back and open the Dodgers have kept a chance to but that's about it in terms of\nThe ... but that's starting rotation is there something that I think it's going to be great series with crew in LA\nThere was announcing gentler being joining us so one of the things that we hear about in the in the playoffs and post season is due to the attention levels rise players get a little tighter I haven't seen that with this brewers team\nAnd I'm guessing they don't feel that either they seem to have a a sense of uh we belong here we want to play hard like we have all season and they and they seemed like a team that's as bad as possible and there's a relaxed as you could be going into the next series\nAnd they've had a lot of experience and the Michael Jackson Lorenzo pain of one man one world series championships together Curtis Granderson and senator and a number of World Series and important long postseason series as well\nWe have experience that got a ton of experience in that aspect um and even their young guys are ... who are on running until he gave us a couple of days ago against Colorado He's played very well so far in the postseason became one sixty three in Chicago where have forget\nI think they're really I'm really enjoying a lot of of the experience from the brewers clubhouse great counts of course has a much postseason experiences anybody score to win Romney\nUm that was against the the Cleveland Indians remember the Marlins have a big hit the diamond backs of course when they want to down to the one so they play lose it ... it has to play with that that's the way the brewers teams played for the last couple of years and and I don't think that's going to change even when the CFPB starts on friday night at north park\nSo we moved from a five game series best the five to seven other than a number of games what's what's the changes for the manager wants to change in approach for the players in the best of seven series\nI think the biggest change is that you have three consecutive game for three four five in the road ballparks the brewers have home field advantage but only play the games at home but any stretch the look at wanting to park and then have to go to Dodger Stadium three four five\nYears because you have three straight games you might have to act and starting pitcher did the roster rivers halfway Peralta veil over half joking dollars neater pitch in Rio de ...\nUm to those those might be called the guys that factor into this may be back in the um ... is on the roster chase Anderson is on the roster so\nThat there will be ... through the the the out get her group quote unquote I don't see that position while your group changing much but the the pitching staff is going to change a little bit going into games\nI'm going into a seven game to the cause of five years\nAnd tell you the brewers and also just got a couple of minutes left so as we get set for friday both teams will be well rested that their pitchers will be positioned appropriately to uh give you the best chance of winning what other what her things go into these these days leading up to uh to the next series when you're when you're not playing baseball\nDo you have to still maintain that high level of practice how how does that all all shakedown\n... a lot of people talk about that that\nBecause the government they are if you lose your your battles testing that's your um\nYour yeah and I don't want to say will 'cause that's not that's not right but just haven't seen the light or so to speak on the brewers are are taking the day off they had yesterday off of course for travel where's the light workout it's not mandatory day there will be a workout so borrowing a workout on Thursday\nBatting practice at ... records that subsided going on in the brewers front office was that the scouts the advance scouts already put their reports together\nUm and it just looking at video at this point you're down to the final three teams with the red Sox the Yankees they're turban theories\nSo you're you're one of the final two teams in the national league there are no secret to this point do you face each other within the last couple of months um it just a matter of staying finely tuned holding ground ball\nI'm taking your batting practice getting your both ends and and I think those are really important things to do and um now I think the brewer just these couple of days are going to be really important to both and they get their raft\nJeremy ... record label walking stories they all pitched in in all three games a division series on couple of days off for them to get your ... a lot of good\nJust liberating brewers announcer great to talk to you enjoy calling your first and they all cs this weekend\nI'm pretty sure that I appreciate thanks to\nYou Jeff LeBron grows announces fun to talk to them and we get to talk to them every week as we go to brew October here and uh you know this is about as good as it gets for brewers fan as we've been waiting a while for as\nThe fans are ready the stadium certainly can be ready Miller Park will be all set on friday and uh the enthusiasm of talking about voter enthusiasm earlier well brewers fans enthusiasm is at record levels and uh\nIt should be fun to watch the series playoff brewers Dodgers\nYou can hear it All right here on WGN as they do legendary hall of famer that voice ... bring as well after the break number three of our forests hand\nSome weather makes the fourth time that's next urging WTO ... twenty twenty millennials are expected to be the largest living generation percentage wise in America Jerry beta responses backed by asking why are they dominating policy Jerry's in for jet lag and this week and he reads the discussion today as twelve ten\nInteresting question and I'll be listening to a jury a course filling in for Jeff all this week um\nAnd here's what I Know ... they're very sensitive to any question about there on the political\nOpinions they were very feisty and that's a good thing we want people to be engaging in a good conversation what part of that equation and this will irritate the millennials in the audience you also have to be willing to listen to other people all generations can do better at that including my generation\nSo all generations can be better at that but I just noticed millennials little touchy on civil the political issues are a number three or four at ten\nHurricane Michael set to make landfall\nUpdated category ... storm now Eric bearing down on the Florida Panhandle governor Rick Scott and I'll know telling people use some of the people you've got to get out of there\nYeah and there's concern of the storm surge on this one is well not nearly as high the Carolina one this one is about ten to twelve foot storm surge that they're worried about obviously some of these areas are prepared for that type of thing\nAlso it makes this storm different than Florence the one that hit the Carolinas is that it's moving a lot faster\nIf you recall Florence was just moving slowly and slower than just sat there for a while Michael he's moving quick in should blow through this area very fast which will be helpful you won't have as much as the green situation that we saw earlier\nYeah and I ... I used to live in Florida in the mid eighties and in in the Tampa area Clearwater area and and I didn't have a hurricane but it had a a a tropical storm and it is amazing because a lot of those areas along\nThe shore are very low lying so any storm surge a lot of those areas have been protected they have they have residents are lifted up like the ... are actually the parking is is that the bottom so they dealt with this before\nBut when you're moving that many people out of this region and I've seen numbers like a hundred thousand plus people you've got high winds sustain it a hundred and ten miles an hour the risk is significance\nAnd it seems like he's added a few of these storms this year uh there's always that the question now is is the climate is changing the the weather rent that's not going to go away that the debate is going to happen forever but uh we we've seen\nIt's been a relatively normal season I Would say it's not ... at least in the classroom and a lot more hurricanes but this is more normal but as Michael approaches lots of folks in the Florida Panhandle bracing for what what what could be a major hurricane and it seems to be very strong winds are strong as I said and the good thing is\nPeople are planning for these things probably better than they've ever done before I think the communication is better a FEMA the federal emergency management association full ... they're they're telling people the right thing getting that people out if that makes landfall as a cat three you're talking about some pretty significant winds anywhere from Destin, Florida\nSo Appalachia bay a bench supposed to go north to use to Georgia in the Carolinas where the Carolinas they're still recovering from their hurricane and and that flooding which range still happening\nTo some degree that don't don't do that water level has not gone down what do they call it a thousand year flood event when one of these hurricanes comes comes to town so as you can imagine gas generators water all the emergency supplies sold out many places but uh that part of the country they're not a\nIt's not a unique story but it's one that they had to face a few times you know in twenty eight teams they're prepared no ... yeah so hurricane Michael\nAh hopefully will not do as much damage as we've seen some of the previous hurricanes the Houston and the ... and ah you know the Puerto Rican hurricanes of last year so well monitored that story as it prepares to make landfall somewhere\nIn Florida and the next few days Morrow tomorrow\nTomorrow yeah uh that's what we're three of our forests and coming up after the break an interesting one for me as somebody or you know I've talked about marijuana and marijuana referendum is on the show a number of times it's always one of our hotter topics\nI feel I have to be a huge problem I mean anybody that has a drank\n[noise] drinking has much more of your body THC does um in regards to him saying that her father just being higher of THC level\nAll they did back then was smoke or\nYou know I they smoke longer to get the same high so that to narrow the point I I Am probably one of the Vegas conservatives that you'll ever meet and I think that the Republican Party completely dropping the ball\nOne on popularity with this issue and to revenues for our country and said\nDo you support both recreational andme additional legalization\nAbsolutely if you're going to let somebody go buy a thirty pack of beer how can you not let them smoke marijuana\nSo let me let me ask you 'cause you're in point about conservatives in the end and I echo some of that I I've heard that those comments from conservatives and I've said openly that I support medicinal or not there yet on recreational why do you think that is why do you think of your\nConservative runs runs have been pushing back against this\nI have no idea I mean for years or a dollar or something you know that the liberals polished 'em and now\nWe're at the point where there is a big chance for us as conservatives to change the entire culture of our country and to get people to understand that we are you know for our country we are very patriotic we are very\nLooking at getting our country out of that mhm and I think we're just dropping the ball out it it just it drives me crazy that somebody can go and get hammered drunk and get behind the wheel\nThat somebody you know they're not for say that you can't comparing apples to apples\nDoesn't make any sense because there's ways to test for somebody who's driving you know all the things that have to follow them play at the same way it does for alcohol but you know if you're going to allow drinking that actually harms people's bodies mhm and you know and the biggest thing that\nBothered me if you know back a few months ago as one our attorney general perhaps all came out and\nSell the stuff I'm CBD Oil you know so you are how are how producers in our state to not take a by product out of something they're already produced thing to make their ... that's extremely profitable it just it doesn't make any facts\nAll right thanks for the call Josh let's take one more Frank from Fox lake you're on WGM J what do you think Frank\nRight I think they could read it like a ... one my wife has three backup ... got metal plate to her doctor will not give her ... this is over here ... ... ... ... ...\nWe tried marijuana we tried it works for my wife is you don't have high paying her weight but I don't understand these people are talking to people I Know well never fight the garlic I drink I Want to fight\nWith ... that things with a personal story Frank and I agree with Frank for medicinal uses I I'm ready to sign up right now I ... I don't know why we're\nNot doing everything we can to make cancer patients and patients those people who have back issues as comfortable as possible it's proven that it has a pain relief elements who in\nThe strength of the of the the medical marijuana is perfectly I'm related to kind of easing that that pain burden in threshold for for those people are suffering why wouldn't you do that the recreational pieces of bigger bigger question for me and I don't think the state as anywhere close to doing that yet\nBut if you don't think it's on people's minds you're not paying attention\nSixteen counties to cities are going to have it on on the ballot in November that shows you there's interest in talking about it most medicinal and recreational and that's the story that's not going to\nQuickly die and they got to go to break down and got about thirty seconds what do you think are\nWell let's just go straight to him and ethical I'm a paraplegic I have a tremendous amount of nerve and locked or my accident and my wife had the opportunity in Washington state got some TV CBD Oil\nAnd drop in the morning a drop in the afternoon and I can drop in the evening reduce my pain from the threshold of a a A N eight down to it to you know at work\nAll right well thanks for their testimony ... I've heard that from a lot of people have heard it today there's a there's a reason why this is coming foreign people understand especially in the midst of this opioid crisis we're dealing with why wouldn't you give people the opportunities\nCan be really interesting to see the results of these referendum or after November sixth across Wisconsin counties cities getting their residents opinion on whether they should go on medicinal and recreational marijuana after the break they found one in Lake Michigan that story and that is right near the beach engine\nWhat you said before we get to the news of the hour\nLake Michigan yesterday\nSome swimming by\nCame in what the heck didn't\nWant to know in Lake Michigan\nEric the mentally gator by the way that he learned in to the lingo ... and ...\nYeah and it came in and alligators in the same and I know I was a genius but the same family entertainment have longer cheese which is frankly either running and in this case they wrap them the snow so they couldn't fight anything\nSo this was in Lake Michigan yes off the coast Waukegan they're humanoid David cast in NATO was kayaking you spoke with rusty Milburn about that\nIn a like a big thing floating and I thought it was a famine\nHe was fishing so it went over to check out this dead salmon and\nWhen I got closer I you know that it was it looked like a little alligator I wasn't sure if it was real and so I got closer than I that was able to see that movie\nYou mentioned the tape to mouth shut so clearly someone had his own this pet ahead of time since the mouth was shot the\nPaper about when you get a bite\nOf course anyone who knows anything about alligators aren't Cain ends you know that the stronger to bite down than it is to open up so that's why they had the tape around and my guess is whoever owns this thing didn't want it to hurt anybody since they were teaching it so they\nKept his mouth shut and that's my guess and we haven't figured out who owned the exotic than just you have to so you and I were talking about this before the show yeah they take the mouse and this probably isn't the first time this happens is the first time and discovered it\nPops up occasionally usually some like python or some kind of crazy exotic pet that someone has ... doesn't know what to do and then the digits them\nSo I prescribe to the theory that nature finds a way and for all those little saying well never would survive the cold there's warm water places these things can hang out\nIf people keep doing this crazy stuff that they released these arrows on so how is it would it be shocking at some point if we we start to see these things popping up on their own hands [laughter] isn't that terrifying for for a state that loves its waterway in lakes and it's so\nEasy to get ... member doing stories about this in the past you can order them online and get like a little twelve inch long one that eventually grows bigger you didn't like go to the flea markets or you can just see things so it's not a shot\nThat someone may have owned the shades of Jurassic Park yeah met a smaller much smaller scale so that that's our uh tidbits man these planes your sturgeon scary stuff though\nFour foot long Keenan basically an alligator floating around Lake Michigan and to the folks who did that ... not a good thing\nAre coming up in the eleven o'clock hour or we had it for a political civil war in this country I'm going to take your calls on that one as well are we that's next right here WGM Jay [noise] good\nNice to be with you on this Tuesday\nAlmost meeting the greens [noise]\nWas nice of October not too bad [noise]\nAs we uh celebrates the best of\nFall in October in Wisconsin is one of those things will remember for a while as we get closer and closer to the cold weather the nasty weather that has crept in northern regions of our states in the UP so thanks to listen to this thing is always wherever you are Crosse Wisconsin in the UP or annoy\nFestivals all over the country listening on ... on line so appreciate those folks as well where else on Facebook ... can sinus\nAnd W. W. dot Facebook Tama slashing six twenty WGM Jay I'm questions comments my question this half hour is a simple\nOr we hadn't sort of political civil war and the reason I asked that question what was a couple of reasons one we've we've now seen nearly two years presidents\nAnd I always frame it this way uncharacteristically on presidential does things that are much different fashion than most presidents have ever done things tweets essentially whatever he wants whenever he wants in in a way to a lot of people most citizens aren't comfortable with\nWe could we could spend an hour talking about the rage from the left\nThat are still are uncomfortable with the fact that President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but that's not what we're ... we're we're going today I'm going to the most recent example and you can weigh in ... four seven nine nine one six twenties\nMortgage talking touch science also give us your question on Facebook as well we just went through the nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh now a sitting member of the U.S Supreme Court process of played out over the course of a couple of months\nWe saw initially when when the president's elected Brett Kavanaugh on it and frankly I think as Senator Ron Johnson said earlier on the program it could have been anybody\nAny Republican any conservative any person\nThe left would have found a way to sort of trying to break the sun and to slow down the nomination their their math and there's some legitimacy legitimacy to this anger about what happened to Merrick Garland at the er the last few months of the last the last year the Obama administration and I said publicly on the show\nAnd I and I think that that that's got a comfortable but I also think there are you know three times in a row a United States as a whole has voted for liberal representation at the presidential level but in the last several a court nominees we've gotten conservative that like\nThe government is going in the opposite direction of what public voting or I'm not saying\nGet rid of the electoral college Trump was elected president I think like I don't ban or government isn't representing where people are voting for him and I think that the root of all the problems\nRight well thanks for the call Christian you know one of the reasons I bring this up is because I'm interested in a civil conversation\nI think it's still possible\nAnd it does bother me when I see people unable to have a civil conversation on social media because I think that's one of the platforms than where we could actually benefit from from some back and forth unfortunately it's taken over by one of ... people I call her social media terrorists they want to blow up conversations they want to be\nReally not truth tellers but opinions spreaders where the opinion is if you don't agree with me you're somebody just evil hate filled you you put a you put a descriptive turning their whatever when you'd like that's the problem that's the issue social media is an amazing\nNew way to communicate but we are so bad at it and let me take a quick break got more calls more tax on the conversation where else on space but those folks want to check us out there where does this go\nAs some of the causes that we may be in a Cold War civil war on politics where can we go from here that's ...\nEvery story ended up being published pod cast ticket links galleries find everything ... on the hunt\nFor the first World Series title on your mobile device tax brewers to Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty for the latest on the schools [noise] I'm thrilled with this ah this this brewers team this year they miss\nFun to watch from day one when I was broadcasting out at Miller Park to a today where we are now getting ready for the NFL's yes lots of good stuff\nBut now we're talking about a civil war and one of the uh Texas had a great point maybe it's an on civil war that's missed from sturgeon bay yeah maybe how do we fix it do we want to fix it or is one side\nBoth sides think they're right therefore they don't require any fixing or maintenance of this instability we see playing out across the country must go to pat and Frank's ville you're on WGM Jacob ...\nGood money what do you tell just a comment on beef you read revolves around the Brett Kavanaugh issue gave Mitch McConnell the frozen food not using new your option where you had the sixty votes it\nWould not have been so contentious\nOkay so I guess where do we go from here the reality is that the rules now that's the way it works where do we go from here I Do we how do we improve the dialogue between both parties because as you and I both know if it doesn't improve the chances of getting any significant legislation done an immigration or health care probably aren't going to be too likely\nKnow ... if if it has gone so far both direct not not this one this from both parties have gone so far right or left who improve their personal positions that it is splitting the country right now in the center\nYou think it could it could we could see the rise of a third party that represents that group of people you're talking about\nNo wherever there was not the monetary or I don't think there's a will people to get the most part not there's the third part not to be strong enough ... to ah that that challenged the two major party\nAll right thanks for the call type smart car you know to be honest\nWhile it seems unlikely that might be a scenario maybe a splinter Republican group that comes off I mean most of the movement much of the anger has been directed towards this president and I I've been saying for a while there's things that that this president does it drives me nuts\nAnd I and just because I'm a conservative and Republican Memphis where everything that President on that notion is his frankly\nSilly it's not the way it works just like any Democrat shouldn't have anything and everything that Bill Clinton did or any other Democratic president\nOr from the Fort one for I'm a Republican but I hate to uh we we have representing us he makes us look bad a you bring up as conventional side which you don't agree with neither do I but he is the voice of Republicans well that's the that's the challenge\nFor Republicans and conservatives best your president\nFor me the alternative was worse Hillary Clinton and a lot of people may may disagree with me on that might fundamental reason why I I continue to talk about this because I don't know that\nThe folks who are playing this game this this incident in civility this on civil game understand that given that any hope of progress on any of the major issues that we always talk about\nIn this country for to secure healthcare immigration policy in general\nWhat states should do versus what the federal government should be responsible for Social Security Medicare all those things will not be six if we don't fix this problem person in the last ... 'cause I Know we got to get the news here\nThe fact that Christine Blasey Ford was outed after she requested confidentiality is a crime that Democrats and Republicans should be shutting out loud if something should be done about that and if that doesn't happen that's inexcusable and and shameful\nDown over the Los Angeles Dodgers base in the house yes how much different with right now says Ross or look on friday night great massive takes the gas and brewers tonight starting as six or seven ... back on the ground\nAnd Wisconsin soil after spending the weekend in Colorado cheering on not cheering uncovering the brewers as they beat the Colorado Rockies moved to the and now she has since begins friday against the Dodgers at Miller Park I'm going to go backwards a little bit before I should back to this Columbus Day story a lot of great tax on my previous\nTopic and this is a common statement and then I might just read the first couple of sentences are actually the first sentence tired of this both sides are bad nonsense\nAnd it's actually goes on to say that Republicans to blame for all of this\nI understand people think that I understand Democrats believes there and the rights\nThat Republicans on this president are causing all the issue but I can also tell you\nThere's a large number of people on the other side of that equation who think Democrats are causing the issue hence the reason for the incivility and the potential cold slash civil war\nWhile you have a right to that opinion it demonstrates them hardly and clearly what I'm Talking about your dismissing an entire side of the political spectrum because you don't like what they say\nAnd if you don't think Republicans have legitimate viewpoints I don't think you're really paying attention to what's going on in the country doesn't mean the country's not changing country always change its\nCountry a hundred years ago is not like the country today\nThere are serious problems in this country those problems are unique to both to ... uh Republicans or Democrats because we've had both sides of the Iowa leading the country over the last few decades the problem is we don't fix those problems\nWe talk about them extensively I'm On one side of the island just we have callers instructors on on both sides as well\nTo page one party which is what some people want to do as evil massages racist out of touch is not helping the situation\nThose of us like me who believe in less government at least that the federal level that's a legitimate due viewpoints if you think the government's gonna fix health care look at what they've tried to do in other areas look what they've failed to do on opioids\nProtect us citizens are population they failed miserably in many ways getting in the way of fixing that issue you may think strongly that Republicans are evil and racist and all the other things I have talked about\nThere's plenty of great Republicans were going about their lives raising her family's making a living granting jobs\nWho may not even like this president but the alternative was worse at least in their mind and in my mind you don't have to like it\nWhat if you're going to continually take the mindset that the other party is bad and I I Know a lot of Democrats they're not bad people I think they're mistaken on some things but they have\nThey also have some legitimate ideas that I think are are worthy of a vetting and ... and trying to see you know work and I'm I'm a strong advocate of actually making the process\nWork as it was designed to because that's clearly not the case now so when I raised the issue of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and how\nChristine Blasey Ford was treated if you're going to defend women to the point where you're going to believe all women are which is apparently what some people want to do\nWhy don't you go the extra step in question why a woman who whose identity she asked to be kept confidential was not protected by Dianne Feinstein by her staff by other Democrats why isn't that something you are concerned about\nSo that now this woman who could have done this in privates tell her story was ousted\nIn front of international media\nPlease check our website for the program scheduling upcoming games and of course you can hear live play by play an syndication by using a radio and turning to six twenty WGM jak\n\nMorning Wisconsin eight thirty five these video with you on this Tuesday thank you for listening is always Seventy one degrees this this is this the last horizon saying that every every time it warms up again but is this the last hurrah\nOf warm summer like whether in Wisconsin before we settle in for the for the deep freeze that we all know it's coming at some points great show today eleven o'clock hour\nOr we had it for a political civil war in this country I've been monitoring gauging\nExamining the the discourse on social media about anything political it could be remotely connected to the political debate in this country and I will tell you this people are losing their minds\nAre we headed for a civil war at least one that involves social media will spend some time and eleven o seven eleven thirty five had to get this and yesterday was Columbus Day how many new is Columbus Day yesterday no male of course\nWell I'll tell you about a city that said you know what we've been celebrating this holiday forever we're not going to celebrate anymore and ah what that means for the country and uh one of those larger questions about a political political correctness\nWith changing\nI guess energy when it comes to celebrating holidays\nThat we've celebrate in the past and how things are are transforming across the face of the country will ... will spend some time that eleven thirty five of course the ten o'clock hour before at San before they get stories as we see it across Milwaukee to state in the world and in the sports world we all have our Green Bay Packers but the brewers are the story of the week\nWe now know who they're going to play the Los Angeles Dodgers friday at Miller Park\nSo we're going to spend some time with the brewers Jeff ... doors announce it will join us at ten Fifteen we're also going to throw in some uh some other stories in the Fort Sam marijuana referendum all over the ballot in Wisconsin good idea that's my my question\nAnd I'll at ten forty four I'll give you a story you probably won't share on CNN because it doesn't fit the Brett Kavanaugh narrative but it's one that women should celebrates wonder if they will nine o'clock hour usually joins me on Monday the editor right Wisconsin James descend on root beer Baldwin\nDebate last night first of three debates and nine thirty five year bill said he's got his W teams that cares raised the beam\nWTO cares initiative or spent some time on that so they were gonna learn a lot about Andrea harbor men or the woman who was killed uh during nine eleven that events in New York City will spend some time learning about her from her sister's prospective so interesting story at nine thirty five\nAnd also eight forty five so joining us a few minutes US Senator Ron Johnson plenty to talk about there as well be Kavanaugh nomination now ... confirmed now sitting on the U.S Supreme Court where do you think of the process he was very vocal\nAbout what he thought was happening with the the accuser Christine Blasey Ford or use the term false memories will ask them about that and also uh the other stories in Washington is as far as health care immigration these are stories that came up during the debate last night when I started the show\nWith the U.S Senate debate last night and I watched it twice actually because I wanted to see if what I saw the first time was a accurate incorrect and I'll give you my quick synopsis am I play a little bit of each\nState senator leave a U.S senator Tammy Baldwin a quickly Seventy Baldwin and I've said this for at least a year on the show for a U.S senator to be that bad public speaking to not be able to handle just answering direct questions\nI thought she was forced and plus you had to think about our answers that it it's ingested to me that she had memorized talking points and at some point it stumbled to to remember what she had memorized and for ... where\nShe was on the attack now clearly she's the underdog here she had to be\nSomeone to play a little bit of ... were first just demonstrating how she approached this debate\nJust say you know I Want people to understand that bottom line care gets rid of Medicare it gets rid of medicated getting rich gets rid of people don't care I can tell and agree on that it gets ran track here and it gets rid of private insurance we cannot like Jeff ... foreign\nYou know you are on um you are trying to attract\nLately ever there and fortunately\nThinks that he didn't read about Medicare but that aside [noise] senator\nBottom line not read the center of our land [noise] maybe you didn't read the down the veil abolished von mad if they do not have allowed on\nThe moderators were trying to get a handle on on the two of them as they went after each other clearly\nTammy Baldwin doesn't do a lot about health care she's talking to a nurse medical professional who who clearly does know a lot about health care has lived in that environment\nAnd as I said over and over again Tammy Baldwin is good at playing the role of US Senators she's not good at the actual worked every that's required for that job here's a little bit\nOf Tammy Baldwin also on health care\nFor a bed and then the ... that has unraveled here for the health care act and threatening the affordability armed again coverage for people consistent conditions\nOr lastly we have a battle in court right now\nI which would declare lotto maybe Affordable Care act unconstitutional [noise] but it would indeed prevents or I Would release insurance every obligation to cover people with preexisting conditions so we have some urgent immediate issues\nIf I could follow up you'll have thirty seconds to do that I did not hear something on how you think we could pay for this Medicare for all is it going to require higher payroll taxes or income than\nDoing nothing I Would cost more\nClassic avoidance of an of a question a good job Charles Benson for following up on that but you didn't answer the second time either\nThis this nonsense that doing nothing costs more we have healthcare systems in place we have medical providers we have insurance companies we have employers provided providing health care we have government provided health care\nAnd Medicare and Medicaid [noise]\nI'm not sure what she means by that and the and and clearly it's not documented about what you're talking but I Do know this\nTrillions of dollars to do what she's talking about\n\nHer debates her performance at that debate was pathetic for a sitting US Senator to to not be able to speak ... to flee to just to answer questions here's how I judge people's conversation when I'm Talking to someone one on one\nIf I ask you a question about something that you are supposed to be experienced in if I if I I ... I have a place you hesitating installing\nAnd not answering the direct question I ask ask you then I pretty quickly realized you know you don't know what I'm Talking about or you know what you're talking about and that's what I saw last night so suffered Tammy Baldwin\nYou got to pick it up you may love the job but you're not doing the job [noise]\nAll right after the break US Senator Ron Johnson senior center from Wisconsin will join us that's natural hearing W teenager\nMade forty six these video on WGM Jay joining me on the phone line now as US Senator Ron Johnson\nOrange the guy doing I'm good I'm Glad you could spend a few minutes with us on the phone I wanted to ask you about a now that it's Brett Kavanaugh is sitting on the yeah\nYou know the U.S Supreme Court that process you take away from a couple of months of a what a lot of his sons as extreme partisan battle by Democrats trying to blow up a guy's career frankly as life your thoughts on that process and wherever I Know\nIt was not great process no doubt about it and I think one of the points of testimony that they're really made an impression on me is when professor Ford made the comment that\nExcept for the incident itself the last two weeks has been the worst for life now\nThose worst two weeks' worth ... provided to hurt by the Republican Party that was democratic operatives a that was her own attorneys who didn't apparently tell her that she could have done this privately in California or to the apparently never even told her that was a repeated offered by the Senate Judiciary committee so maybe on the other\nNoteworthy aspects as well as for example than evolved when he made a blind to what we said last night within forty eight hours I'm not exactly sure of the exact timing I'm after so many Democrats completely a\nMade up their mind before they even knew who the nominee was they were going to be just resistant\nI'm completely you know they are used as an excuse\nMerrick Garland amount America that again I send them back courtesy I don't know one Republican that tried to destroy America just very simply said within eight or eight months of the president's re election this one slip the court let's let the American people decide whether they want the Supreme Court flipped\nFrom a more conservative court to digital activists court with a bunch of super legislators among people decided for nobody tried to destroy\nMerrick Garland Democrats that was their goal from day one destroy a good man and his family he was a very sad very ugly episode and I hope the people in America I Hope the forest in Wisconsin noticed staff\nThe inability to speak ... topics just to take your experience your life experience as an elected official and be able to talk about it officially and effectively I think if you're a voter Wisconsin you've got to look at that and say wow what are you doing up\nThere as well as we pointed out on on the regular ... Twitter feed last night during the debate\nIt it sounded almost as if that Tammy Baldwin was an inexperienced challenger and that leaves ... where it was actually the incumbent ... came out strong she was consistent all the way through and being able to answer the questions are we are dominated the debate format it was kind of hard because\nAt times it seemed like the the questioners and team evolved when\nShe was debating all of them um but\nWe really knew how to handle it and it goes back to her experience and they're very on Sunday Morning talk shows and things like that\nLee is very good on the stump and she was very good on her feet last night and being able to answer all the questions and and to get across her talking points while Tammy Baldwin just it was almost like she was lost in space\nWell I mean let's look at Tammy ball and this is just as a senator first ... first term she's somebody that really does not do a lot of\nMedia she she'll do selective thing she'll answer a few questions at at at campaign events where she's surrounded by our colleagues on the left but she doesn't do a lot of as I said accept rainiest speaking it does she know the issues\nWill she was ... from watching her last night and it didn't look like the she nearly as she was she was using a lot of buzz words that are very effective in front of democratic crowds and ah she was the one percent and different things but even on like gun control issue which you would have thought that she would have just nailed I mean you know\nShe could have talked to a link to balance the tragedies that have gone on and how we have here is tied to the ... and instead it was just a very halting the answer it just it seemed like she was desperately climb for ... for the right thing to say\nAnd uh it's we don't know if it's just campaign fatigue or what the what she doesn't seem to be making too many campaign interviews [laughter] so it's it's very hard to understand why she wasn't weren't prepared after being in in the Senate for six years\nHis or if it makes sense how's her campaign rightly using TV to portray this candidates who really frankly isn't ready to deal with someone one on one but it's it's easy to to free record\nAnswers to show up in manufacturing facilities the sharp talking to cancer patients using that tastes presidents some to make the case that she's\nReady for prime time well\nI think that that's what they're trying to do is they're going with the airwaves campaign that TV campaign or their outspending live nearby a vast amount of money is Tammy Baldwin as a huge war chest of special interest money\nTo campaign on and and she's just going to war with the amount of money that we have we're can spend and uh that's the that's the goal is to make the debate irrelevant at this point if you can if you can just swamp book we're on television you know if you can\nIf you can just bombarded with with television ads I make ... we're looked like this awful person then that's the strategy for for Tim evolved with at this point\nJames witnessed an editor right Wisconsin joining me to take a quick break after the break I Want to dissect some of the issues they they spend a lot of time and health care immigration and border security ball I tend to Bob in an interesting sign ON Technology and the border\nFrankly someone who's ignored that the other problem forever more of a James whether you're sitting next right here in the ... Seventeen sees me with you on this Tuesday we are joined Tuesday edition James witnessed an editor right Wisconsin so the substance of the the debate last night which we both said\nSemi balls or did not do well and they spent a lot of talking about health care and I thought I'm we're Brooklyn was very fact that she she has a nurse she somebody has worked in that profession in that field\nAnd frankly Tammy Baldwin with this\nCommon theme now that I hear from some Democrats um that it costs more to do nothing I asked Senator Ron Johnson but then he said that's just ridiculous so what is your what was your take away a Tammy Baldwin's plan for health care in the United states\nSo and she says that it costs more to do nothing she's talking about in the aggregate that all of us would pay more if we do nothing not what the federal government is going to pay not with taxpayers are going to pay for taxpayers are going to pay thirty two trillion dollars over ten years of Tammy Baldwin has away\nAnd and everything that we have here said last night was correct I mean is\nIt what boggling is proposing is just a train wreck of government complete government control of health care and uh I thought that we are commanded that issue very well\nIt just when when she challenged Baldwin and said you haven't even read your own bill gives you an idea of just how lost in space Tammy Baldwin was last night\nHe played some of that the some of that audio just the fact that the ... I thought it was very strong and and ... and ... as you said earlier approaches if she was the incumbent candidate going after attacking a cat her fellow candidates in Tammy Baldwin sitting senator\nWho has a if you believe the last ... last fall a double digit lead we know that the new polls coming out tomorrow we'll get to that in a second but is this the right strategy for ... well\nI think so I think when you're when you're behind you have to go on the edge of the fence of and that's exactly what it would look very damning she did a very effectively whether or not the debate is going to move people or whether or not I was just part is is watching the debate last night\nBut it was ... it to be on the stage state wide really for the first time a much broader audience and I think that she did a very effective job and taking it to Tammy Baldwin\nThe other big issue of immigration border security Tammy Baldwin hadn't had was asked directly by vehicle clear about what her plan was and and it affected me as well we have to raise the term open borders and Democrats although they don't say that term\nAll the all the ideas and policy things they talk about suggested that the reality with Kevin Ball and raised in the issue of like a a technology being the answer and and related to the wall your your thoughts on where she was kind of going with that\nWell in Democrats talk about that the sort of excuse to do nothing is that they're going to say well we could do this that and the other thing and then they never do it it's kind of like how they authorized border security but then they never pay for it and sort of border security never actually happens [noise]\nUm that's that's the Democratic playboy you sound like you're going to do something about illegal immigration which are really not in Tammy Baldwin has been rather death on the issue of avoiding the whole thing about whether or not to abolish ice\nOr she's ... she's been saying that she is in favor of of abolishing ice with so many of our democratic colleagues at this point in the heart and if you don't have to have that police agency doing the immigration enforcement you're going to have a lot of bad actors in this country and in Tammy Baldwin really needs the answer whether or not she disagrees with our colleague\nFunny asking voters question so as I said ... evolving effectively using the TV airwaves to tell her story to portray candidate\nThat those of us who actually their hands were to her work as a U.S senator understanding as fiction but does that work with the voters are they seeing these ads and thinking oh my God Tammy carrot cares about me as an individual and is that the way you you when these elections\nWhen I was really interesting was how much leader who spent last night talking about how to him he doesn't care and how much we it does care I mean and she was when she was talking about being a nurse\nIf she was talking about very specific examples from her nursing experience and but also\nShe was talking about how Tammy Baldwin says one thing in Washington DC and says something else when she's back home trying to really stress the fact that there's a there's a divorce between the Tammy Baldwin the sun the commercials and the ... the real senator Tammy Baldwin he thought\nThat during the debate leader was very good at and pushing their point\nOne of the things I've said about Santa Barbara for a while as a follower neither leader as a new center and that's not unusual but typically when you're good at what you do whether it's politics or what our private sector whatever it is\nAt some point the leaders emerged and I just don't see those qualities and Tammy Baldwin but yet it still seems to be playing with the voters in Wisconsin can can live ... flip that switch and turn that around well\nI think so when you look at where Ron Johnson did in his first term compared to\nTammy Baldwin in her first term it's it's a difference of night and day we had a very effective senator Senator Ron Johnson we had a very ineffective senator and Tammy Baldwin a she's still proposing things that that Republicans propose an effort to try and curry favor with the voters but she's not going to move on those issues either\nShe only gets things done when she absolutely has to win it's election time and that's when she comes up with things but as we saw last night she really doesn't ever command of those issues\nWhat's what's ... what's your biggest vulnerabilities in looking at Tammy Baldwin's campaign and her tenure as you as a U.S senator what's your biggest while they're built you think\nThe biggest vulnerability was the fact that the ... already a beat in Colorado so there were more people tuned in last night as he was on that debate right if the ... and we're actually playing last night came evolved with would have been a lot better off than she better hope that the brewers are playing the same day as the next debate\nI you know again I I started a couple of times already in the hour or so I've been on the air that I was I was shocked at how bad she was at a debate that she should have been prepared for given all the time she had to get ready for this thing and and\nThe inability to answer simple questions\nTo stumble over answers that clearly memorize some information that ... and I'll go back to the point memorizing things is good if you're if you're a good speaker but if you're not a good speaker what it what happens is that exposes your lack of experience and your lack of knowledge about a subject that's what I think got exposed last night well\nBut we're asking for your help to raise the beam its face one of the nine eleven memorial project you can see ... of the plan you can donate at double duty I'm Jake dot com we've made it even easier for you you can even just ... the word beam B. E. A. M.\nTo for one for seven and nine one six twenty we will send you all the information back they can decide for yourself how much or if any money you'd be willing to spend\nThe day and it's one of those great W teams that cares initiative I had one may in May of this loop the service and it's I Know our listeners and they always want to help and they always want to help for a great causes and this is one of those raised a beam Eric bill says WGN Jay chairs initiative just a it's a great effort so help out in any way you can\nTell the story about somebody calling or in the morning showing that I'm ... years offering a crane do what you can do that this was something that will last for a long time and and it it can inspire can educate\nAnd frankly allows as I said some people to just process the the horrific events of nine eleven in this case specifically the loss of lives associate with that so\nA great initiative by air they'll start a after the break we hope to bring the latest on the Nikki Haley resignation also I Want to read a little bit from Craig Gilbert piece on a voter enthusiasm in the state of Wisconsin what that means we spent a lot of time in the early part of the show talking about\nThe U.S Senate race but there's other races as well with him you law school poised to come out tomorrow lots of political tension in the state will try to dissect some of that for your next regime WGM jak\nRecruit was hunting for his first world series title delayed for interviews are right at your fingertips touched the word pitch\nBefore one four seven nine nine wants to twenty four you're our first this project and forget to subscribe\nTo the latest brewers interviews on your mobile device as well all things brewers all things WGM Jay those two things are connected we\nWill be all over that story heading into friday's game at Miller Park against the Los Angeles Dodgers as a battle to see who gets to go to the world series how cool is that\nSo if you want to know about the brewers that's how you do it's a we're monitoring the latest drove to going to update in a few minutes you're on the Nikki Haley situation lots of comments I'm I'm kind of reading social media uh one of the one of the reporter said that she's going to leave at the end of the year uh they quoted president Donald Trump's as saying she wants to take a break\nIn quotes take a break a she has officially resigned as US ambassador to the un it's if it's actually studying news this is somebody Nikki Haley former South Carolina Governor a UN ambassador I thought was one of those front runners in the future for the Republican Party does that mean that can't be the case\nAnd they're gonna be a lot of reasons for the spray hopefully we'll find out more about that but\nIt's a study news especially as one of the reporters said right before the midterm elections\nThe timing is not good and another another a reporter indicating that both chief of staff John Kelly and vice president my parents were taken by surprise by this announcement so clearly some stunning news from the White House and as I said well taken up that hearing a few minutes\nNow why does it matter that the midterms are coming up to do voters really think of Nikki Haley when they're voting for congressman or whatever they're doing\nThat Nikki Haley per se but I'm certain she was an administration complains of people's fears about elections in politics I think anything that dilutes the message is not good if if if it could be perceived and I I I'm just a speculation sure if it can be perceived as a banning the shipper jumping ship\nThat's not a good thing as as we know the president has a lot of has had a lot of turnover in his administration\nGenerally you know weeks or months in advance there's rumor that swirls about it right in this case there were no rumors that just kind of came out of nowhere\nNo as I sat writing style Republican Party this was a woman who I said could be the first woman president salmon she's that good and former South Carolina Governor tremendous uh you know ... an Indian background South Asian background or with a with a career in in a leadership in politics\nUm she has the resume to go forward doesn't mean she won't it's just a bit of a stunner as far as uh as he is the details ... to monitor that from the White House as a president gets to get information\nYeah this is one of those situations where they record the conversation then they play it back so no one has yet it's happening right now but this is what we're hearing you'd want to hear you this\nIs exactly that's what we're hearing from the White House right now just the tone because they don't have a live feed coming out of the oval office at this point so he is just talking she is discussing this with those press pool reporters and then they will bring the audio out after it's completed\nAnd you know one of the things that people speculate is is why that's why she doing this to take a break things could mean a lot of things could be could be health related can be family related could be a lot you know it could be someone in her family as health is she but she wants to deal with you never know or just exhausted by the process yeah I mean it it's\nI wouldn't say that the UN ambassador the United nations is one of the most difficult jobs enlisted minister I should but it's one that's very high profile given you know\nAs I was reading some of the comments she has worked a lot on the north Korea a discussion\nHere we go Nikki Haley is out the latest from ABC\nResigning President Trump tweeting that he had a big announcement with his friend and bats that are hailing in the oval office and they've been meeting there this morning and he sees Karen traverse have more\nI mean it was not an original Trump supporter intact in two thousand sixteen she endorsed and campaign for his Republican rival Senator Marco Rubio she offered the position of secretary of state but said she turned it down because she didn't and she had the experience necessary to fill that role\nHer position as US ambassador to the United nations put her at the center of the president's foreign policy agenda and with a cabinet level position\nBefore she was named by President Trump to hurt you in post she was the governor of South Carolina the first woman to hold that position she was reelected in twenty fourteen\nNikki Haley was a rookie to international politics that unusual to be he went on voice she is the daughter of Indian immigrants again UN ambassador Nikki Haley resigning cherry Preston ABC News\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has a statement now only on Twitter he says Nikki Haley has been a clear consistent and powerful voice for America's interest in democratic principles in the world stage she says she challenged friend and so to be better and Ryan says he sat and that she's leaving the administration\nShe's also indicating at least one report that she will not be running and twenty Twenty one campaign to the president's about some news there as well let's take a quick break after break I'll get to that Craig Gilbert column or or peace rather on now where voters are at which the Wisconsin elections governor's race US Senate race\nAnd how all that a Republican Suzie hasn't had been hearing about since then the cabin on nomination was confirmed and then he was a eventually sworn in what that's done through Wisconsin voters will find that a lot more tomorrow or as well as the new law school Paul all that coming up next regiment WGM shit\nAnd a half Seventy five degrees or Radio City and I\nWill be a warm day maybe our last one day before the cold front comes in and reminds us\nQuickly\nChile chili that we're going to be freezing our butts off fairly soon here in Wisconsin pace we're listening is always a real quick\nUh I was reading the piece by Craig Gilbert in the journal sentinel he he's a great political reporter\nAnd it talks about the G O P voters and how they're looking at the upcoming races and how we you know we've heard this national conversation about the enthusiasm that now seems to be rising this high to Republican voters oh there's a couple of takeaways incredible piece I just want to highlight reel quickly\nA Republican voters and I'm reading right from the uh the article Republican voters aren't as unified miss supportive Trump and Walker as Democrats in their opposition that's one\nRepublican voters aren't as unify behind walkers they were in twenty fourteen while most Republican voters approve of Trump their enthusiasm ranges wildly and the ... minority about one in five either disapproves of the president or think he has changed the Republican Party for the worse one fifth of parties pretty notably troubled by Trump\nSaid polar Charles Franklin and the last couple of Republicans poses a special problem for the G G O Pina number number six election because there's less United behind his party's candidates unless motivated to vote\nAnd I I look at it this way\nAll the stories and the story lines of twenty eight scene when it comes to the lead up to the November elections\nIn their moments are all significance the alternate impacts on polls they can have an impact on voters decision whether or not to actually voting and as we know that process is going to be underway here I'm In and of course leading up to the election on the six in November for all of us who\nAre on the right side of the conservative side of the aisle this is a chance to reaffirm in Wisconsin and that's really what we're talking about here\nThat we're on the right path and I know Democrats including Tammy Baldwin last night like to like to suggest that Wisconsin manufacturers are troubled and voters are troubled and people are screaming loudly for free things free health care or it's excusing\nA your student debt load and all those things but most voters in Wisconsin I think are fairly happy with with the path\nThat we've gone over and over the last few years rising wages and that's that is happening in the corners everyone but Tammy Baldwin\nManufacturers increasing their facilities adding more jobs so many jobs that we can't even keep up with the number of the that's out there and and\nAt some point it may have to bring people from out of state to fill those jobs\nAnd just the low unemployment in general you know record low unemployment in the state of Wisconsin people are doing well they had more money in their paychecks another one of those disingenuous things at the time we bought one said last night is is the uh the ban in men's really of Wisconsin voters and taxpayers\nYou can hear it All right here on WGM journey to the legendary hall of famer that voice ... as well after the break number three of our forests hand\nSome weather makes the fourth time that's next urging WTO ...\nTwenty twenty millennials are much will be the largest living generation percentage wise in America Jerry better responses fact by asking why are they dominating politics Jerry's in for jet lag and this week and he reads the discussion today at twelve ten interesting question and I'll\nBe listening a jury of course filling in for Jeff all this week I'm\nA here's what I Know ... they're very sensitive to any question about there on the political\nOpinions they were very feisty and that's a good thing we want people to be engaging in a good conversation but part of that equation and this will irritate the millennials in the audience you also have to be willing to listen to other people all generations can do better at that including my generation\nSo all generations can be better at that but I just noticed millennials little touchy on several of the political issues are a number three or four at ten hurricane Michael set to make landfall\nUpdated category ... storm now Eric bearing down on the Florida Panhandle the governor Rick Scott now no telling people use some of the people you've got to get out of there\nYeah and there's concern of the storm surge on this one is well not nearly as high as the Carolina one this one is about ten to twelve foot storm surge that they're worried about obviously some of these areas are prepared for that type of thing\nAlso what makes this storm different than Florence the one that hit the Carolinas is that it's moving a lot faster if you recall Florence was just moving slowly and slower than just sat there for a while\nMichael is moving quick and should blow through this area very fast which will be helpful you won't have as much as the green situation that we saw earlier\nYeah and I ... I used to live in Florida and in the mid eighties and in in the Tampa area Clearwater area and and I didn't have a hurricane but it had a a a tropical storm and it is amazing because a lot of those areas along\nThe shore are very low lying so any storm surge a lot of those areas have been protected they have they have residents is that our lifted up like the ... are actually the the parking is is that the bottom so that they dealt with this before\nBut when you're moving that many people out of this region and I've seen numbers like a hundred thousand plus people you've got high winds sustain it a hundred and ten miles an hour the risk is significance\nAnd it seems like you've had to add a few of these storms this year uh there's always that the question now is is the climate is changing the the weather right that's not going to go away but that debate is going to happen forever but uh we we've seen\nIt's been a relatively normal season I Would say it's not ... at least in the classroom and a lot more hurricanes but this year seems more normal but as Michael approaches lots of folks in the Florida Panhandle bracing for what what what could be a major hurricane and it seems to be very strong so the winds are strong as I said and the good thing is\nPeople are planning for these things probably better than they've ever done before I think the communication is better a FEMA the federal emergency management association full prep mode they're they're telling people the right thing getting that people out if\nIt makes landfall as a cat three you're talking about some pretty significant whims anywhere from Destin, Florida so Appalachia bay a dense supposed to go north to use to Georgia in the Carolinas where the Carolinas they're still recovering from their hurricane and and that flooding which range you know happening\nTo some degree that don't don't do that water level has not gone down what do they call it a thousand year flood event when one of these hurricanes comes comes to town so as you can imagine gas generators water all the emergency supplies sold out many places but uh that part of the country they're not uh\nThere's not a unique story but it's one that they had to face a few times you know in twenty eight teams they're prepared no handle it yeah so hurricane Michael\nAh hopefully will not do as much damage as we've seen some of the previous hurricanes to Houston's and the ... and ah you know the Puerto Rican hurricanes of last year so well monitored that story as it prepares to make landfall somewhere\nIn Florida and the next few days Morrow tomorrow yeah uh that's some are three of our forests and coming up after the break an interesting one for me as somebody or you know I've talked about marijuana marijuana referendum is on the show a number of times so I was one of our hotter topics\nAnd this one's a is also going to be one that I think will probably open a phone lines on there's a lot of referendum on the ballot in Wisconsin coming up in November and my basic question is is this a good idea\nFor the ... county you know we're seeing these referendum pop up\nIn many cases recreational marijuana a and and and the relaxing of some of the rules and laws that we've seen on the books when it comes to marijuana possession things like that is this a good idea for the state is that is that our road we should be going down the course of states now that I Would legalize recollect recreational marijuana Colorado\nAnd others where they've now made that an industry\nOn its own billion dollar industry and they're starting to deal with some of the fallout related to those decisions well we're not there yet and I don't know that we're going to get there anytime soon but we're starting to see the first\nYou have to just to go in that direction and that's a referendum kind of asking voters what do you think there was a lot of heavy lifting that would have to happen before that would be the case\nBut in Wisconsin marijuana referendum on the ballot you think it's a good idea or a bad idea I'll let you weigh in for one for seven nine nine once explains the acting it mortgage talking touched my\nPre season rolls on a ship them off the bus continue their preparations for these twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen NBA season next up is a mess up the thunder in Oklahoma\nCity voices the bucks Ted Davis is on the call in our coverage starts with mug shots at six thirty boy lots and lots of sports going on brewers bucks Packers\nLots of things to talk about and of course we're all in the brewers ... because of the\nRamping up on the post season now an L. C. S. beginning friday at Miller Park and will continue to highlight all those are positives of that story line as we try to recover from the negatives of the Packers lost on Sunday to the lions and\nThis week this weekend they don't even play they play a Monday Night actually against the San Francisco forty niners that land both fields so\nWe'll get a momentary reprieve from the Packers story over a Saturday and Sunday at least I'm I before the break I as I tip my hat on the um the sports for ten minutes about marijuana referendum saw story in the journal written by Don bam and if you don't know November is full\nOf marijuana questions and referendum sixteen counties to cities\nWill have marijuana use referendum questions on the ballot this November six Marquis de in them\nMarkey de La Crosse rock counties are asking voters for their opinions on legalizing personal use of marijuana for adults Twenty one years and older\nTen counties in the city of Waukesha are focusing their questions on medical marijuana use clerk and brown counties in Wisconsin asking is medical marijuana should be regulated as a prescription drug\nAnd the other eight counties asking if voters approve of medical use of marijuana recommended by a position was er forest notion Langley Lincoln marathon or temps poured it in ... counties\nSo lots of questions swirling around the ... uh marijuana recreational medicinal and I'm sad for as long as I've had a show on WGM J I support the medicinal use of marijuana anytime you can relieve someone's pain that is a logical place to look it has proven benefits in that area\nAnd a little less enthusiastic about the recreational side of the arguments and I you know not that I think that uh everyone is going to be a pot had and and it's we're going to have you know a bunch of raving lunatics running around but I just wonder if it's the best thing in the best case for a state as they have a bunch of people who are running around high all the time mark in Bristol\nI'm a strong supporter for the referendum only because of the economic boom but I Know several people that can greatly benefit from the medicinal purposes most of the people I talked to are in favor of it as well\nI Believe it will be a landslide decision yes so there's a lot of support out there and that's why I Want to open up the phone lines for one for seven nine nine which they just want to be back in the mortgage talk in Texas when I get it\nI just want to hear the arguments for or against from you let's go to Matt in the heartland your W teams in the morning Matt\n[noise] hey good morning how are you good what do you think\nOh I'd be for a especially medicinal lead it's a good place to start to get bugs worked out of the system but as you just said it it helps people who are in pain that have so few side effects\nAnd there's job creation that can be attached with it and if it's done correctly it can be a really good thing for our states\nWhat do you think about the job creation where where do you see those jobs coming into play\nWell they're not they're not necessarily like\nThe very few jobs you got to be an owner ... or something I I worked in a dispensary in Arizona [noise] ah I worked in the production side of things helping growers harvesting\nAnd you know I can make thirty dollars an hour in the production um peace rape part of the business\nSo some potential there for some people make some money thanks for the call for the call and let's go to Steve in Milwaukee years have you changed your money Steve\nMorning and you know people want to talk about gateway drugs and and everything else the biggest gateway drug out there is the opioid crisis and I can tell you a fan of chronic pain patients uh

alligators or came in you know that the stronger to bite down than it is to open up so that's why they have the tape around and my guess is whoever owns this thing\nDidn't want it to hurt anybody

W. dot Facebook\nComma slashing six twenty WGM Jay I'm questions comments my question this half hour is a civil war\nOr we hadn't sort of political civil war and the reason I asked that question what was a couple of reasons one we've we've now seen nearly two years of the presidents\nAnd I always frame it this way uncharacteristically on presidential does things that are much different fashion than most presidents I've ever done things tweets essentially whatever he wants whenever he wants in in a way that a lot of people a lot of citizens aren't comfortable with\nBecause we could spend an hour talking about the rage from the left\nThat are still are uncomfortable with the fact that President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but that's not what we're ... we're we're going today I'm On a bunch of the most recent example and you can weigh in Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty see acting mortgage talking tech science also give us your question on Facebook as well\nWe just went through the nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh now sitting member of the U.S Supreme Court\nProcess of played out over the course of a couple of months we saw initially when when the president's elected Brett Kavanaugh on it and frankly I think as Senator Ron Johnson said earlier on the program it could have been anybody\nAny Republican and conservative any person\nThe left would have found a way to kind of trying to break this and to slow down the nomination there they're mad and there's some legitimacy legitimacy to this anger about what happened to Merrick Garland at the uh the last few months of the rest of your last year the Obama administration and I said publicly on the show\nAnd actually wrote an op ed about this at at the time that I saw the Republicans should have given threat or America Harlem hearing ... at the minimum nothing would have been confirmed but I think the president does deserve the right to have as many nominees at least get a hearing that's part of the process part of the way it should work\nBut that being set aside I think in my opinion what we saw with Brett Kavanaugh was a no holds barred we're going to do everything we can assume the Democrats to get on the way this nomination we saw two part process\nThe first time it off here and we saw some angry Democrats posturing\nTreating it at the time like it was a court case in a in a in a criminal case you saw it in the questions posed by Kamala Harris senator from California or a book or to some extent some other members are Blumenthal senator Blumenthal\nBut yet when they went to a phase two of the cabinet hearing the Christine buzzy Ford segments of that process they were angered they said when she was treated as if this was a criminal case so there was the double standard there of course from that side\nNow we can we could argue about whether Brett Kavanaugh as qualified to serve on the Supreme Court\nAnd whether that choice added to the drama added to the instability we saw a play on their process but my question for you is simple are we in the midst\nOf a civil war over policy the escalation of rhetoric we see a play on social media you see a play on and protests and the anger\nEspecially on social media I've had friends who have been very very uh\nWilling to attack other people based on their political and policy based\nOpinions and I think that does raise the the anger level to a new to new heights where it's not just about the fact that you were saying something that's different from someone else's opinion but if you dare to be associated with Republicans or conservatives\nWherever the feminist president then you are verbally attacked\nOr in some cases probably it's ugly attacked by by the other side of the aisle for one for seven nine nine one one of the I can and mortgage talking touched my are we in the midst\nOf a political civil war in this country and really where might that storyline go let's go to Paul in Milwaukee are going to be changing in mourning fall\nHey good morning I'm I just thought you were a statement of oh well it's a public school ... all one week with a bigger dirt\nOn them well that's not true who of course like most will cross that there was no there was no ...\nWhy do you think that happen\nBecause he was a good candidate that's why\nI and I would argue that that happened because he wasn't replacing a swing justice on the Supreme Court which is now the Syrian guy\nWho's on the study of the physician\nMust take it back to the civil war peace do you think America\nCitizens are engaged in a civil war when it comes to how they deal with politics who just those policies have someone he talks about whether it's on social media whether it's at a party is that enough to say to someone else I Can't deal with you I'm not going to associate with you\nI Hope all agree that is that oh but you know\nWe tried the civil that we could be or to you know I I you know the ... the lead you in a W I stand are or who is now or not\nThere's not a lot of anger out there were very ... were first with our concerns about the way the Republican or a ram rabbit and we will not part of the you know qualified for her to\nDo you think there's a difference between the approach of Democrats and Republicans I asked us seriously\nOh yeah I I I I wrote a Democrat or a you know the free speech but then ... and I don't know what was done out of the Capitol building out there who caught it as a younger and conservative granted they don't use that\nAnd that that's fine with them um but well yeah yeah yeah when you were going to get out of your Curtis that oh no no we have ... or ... trees that as a mob and what ... what state\nDo you think it's going to get better or worse in this country\nUm I ... I spoke with powerful government check balance a check up on the balance of power I quote ... or ... ... right now we don't have\nAll right well thanks thanks for the call does it mean to cut you off but there's there's a caller who disagrees with me and yet we were able to have a civil conversation about what's happening in this country got to take a quick break after the break more on the civil war is ... is that what's happening in this country unless my civil war based on slavery or states rights and talking about the inability of\nTwo different parties and the people that support those parties to simply get along\nWhether it's in conversation whether it's whether that's been in person or in social media\nNo no for the Los Angeles Dodgers raising the anti all cs how much different ones right now says Ross or look on friday night great massive suggest some brewers tonight starting as six of them and read back on the ground and Wisconsin\nSoil after spending the weekend in Colorado cheering on not sharing uncovering the brewers as they beat the Colorado Rockies to move to the NFL says the essence begins friday against the Dodgers at Miller Park I'm going to go backwards a little bit before I should back to this Columbus Day story a lot of great tax on my previous topic\nAnd this is a common statement and then I might just read the first couple of sentences are actually the first sentence tired of this both sides are bad nonsense and the image actually goes on to say that it's Republicans to blame for all of this\nI understand people think that I understand Democrats believe there and the rights\nThat Republicans on this president are causing all the issue but I can also tell you\nThere's a large number of people on the other side of that equation who think Democrats are causing the issue hence the reason for the incivility and the potential cold slashed civil war\nWhile you have a right to that opinion it demonstrates them hardly and clearly what I'm Talking about your dismissing an entire side of the political spectrum because you don't like what they say\nAnd if you don't think Republicans have legitimate viewpoints I don't think you're really paying attention to what's going on in the country doesn't mean the country's not changing plus you always change\nCountry a hundred years ago was not like the country today\nThere are serious problems in this country those problems aren't you need to ... to ... uh Republicans or Democrats because we've had both sides of the Iowa leading the country over the last few decades\nThe problem is we don't fix those problems we talk about them extensively\nI'm On one side of the island just we have callers inspectors on on both sides as well\nTo page one party which is what some people want to do as evil massaging this racist out of touch is not helping the situation\nThose of us like me who believe in less government at least that the federal level that's a legitimate Butte viewpoints if you think the government's gonna fix health care look at what they've tried to do in other areas look what they'd failed to do on opioids\nProtect us citizens are population they failed miserably in many ways getting in the way of fixing that issue you may think strongly that Republicans are evil and racist and all the other things I have talked about\nThere's plenty of great Republicans were going about their lives raising her family's making a living grading jobs\nWho may not even liked this president but the alternative was worse at least in their mind and in my mind\nYou don't have to like it but if you're going to continually take the mindset that the other party is bad and I I Know a lot of Democrats they're not bad people I think they're mistaking on some things but they have\nThey also have some legitimate ideas I think are are worthy of a vetting and ... and trying to see if if the work and I'm I'm a strong advocate of actually making the process work as it was designed\nTo because that's clearly not the case now\nSo when I raised the issue of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and how Christine Blasey Ford was treated if you're going to defend women to the point where you're going to believe all women are which is apparently what some people want to do\nWhy don't you go the extra step and question why a woman who whose identity she asked to be kept confidential was not protected by Dianne Feinstein by her staff by other Democrats why isn't that something you're concerned about\nSo that now this woman who could have done this in privates tell her story was outed\nIn front of international media\nWhy is that not a concern to you and the Republicans are so evil why are we more concerned about that than you are so there's there's a lot of new ones these stories a lot of details that have to be figured out\nIt's not so easy to just condemn one side of the other\nIt requires a lot more research a lot more understanding and yes that dirty word compromise occasionally but\nIf you're a Republican who hates all Democrats or a Democrat who hates all Republicans yours a problem\nAs a brand one group\nBecause of an hour or D is the foolishness that is politics twenty eight team doesn't mean I'm not going to advocate advocate for what I think is right in my case that's generally conservative principles but I don't have to demonize other people I Will point out when they say things that make no sense\nThat's my job\nDon't get started with the the labeling the it's not it's not Republicans ... Democrats who are are the problem everybody is the problem here we're at where we're at because of bad behavior on both sides I'm trying to say All right we understand the anger how do we\nPeople in this country doing a lot of smart things every day but in politics the cream is not rising to the crop full\nTrue leaders are rare leadership is hard it shouldn't have to be that way I look at the private sector a long list of incredible leadership and leaders\nWhat is it about politics the flip the switch on on brain activity\nThat makes smart people dumb\nI don't expect to solve the world's problems by at least expect a civil conversation about how to try\nTo solve the world's problems and frankly we're not getting that you can be angry\nOn social media and you can slip out or if your friends who have a different political opinion than you do\nThat's not going to help anything\nIt's a collective issue not an individual issue individuality is selfish and not very productive\nWhen it comes to solving the countries are the world's problems these civilians will be ... it was\nWorld Series title militias interviews are ready to just touch the words hits the idea is to form one four seven nine nine one six twenty four hour you're our first pitch policy has enough we have to subscribe to the latest brewers interviews on your\nMobile device and for listeners to my show fans of the show all our podcasts are up on WGM time interviewing Senator Ron Johnson interview with James lingers in the editor right Wisconsin we spent the whole almost the entire half hour talking about your book mirror Baldwin debate last night\nAnd then finally for those brewers fans out there I Know there's a lot of them the interview with brewers announcer Jeff LeBron has is up as well so enjoy the podcast check 'em all out\nTell me what you're saying send me feedback in finance winter a WTO O. J. C. and you can email me is the best video TNT dot com you choose the format\nAlso the acting a mortgage talking talk sign for one for seven nine nine one six twenty alright don't have a ton of time on this but it's it's one of those interesting stories that illustrates the changes in our country so Columbus ohio Ohio capital city population eight hundred and sixty thousand so big in the Milwaukee\nThat city named after Christopher Columbus did not celebrates Columbus Day yesterday they were open for business interesting development and it's actually a smart political player they move their day off in that city named after Christopher Columbus chatting and explore\nWho a marked the arrival in the ... in\nThe Americas at the time on October twelve fourteen Ninety two or so that the honors him and I'm as we know from following our culture and our country lately um\nThe storyline of the creation of our country storyline of whites\nAre European explorers is not a popular one anymore for a lot of different reasons which I don't have time to go into but the interesting twist on decision by Columbus ohio to not celebrate Columbus Day they have switched that day off\nTheir employees and the closure of their city offices to Veterans Day which falls on November twelfth this year\n\nSo I'm thinking about this as an Italian American Columbus Day I Know that in in many places in New Jersey New York other places that still big holiday I think San Francisco still has a a large a present some Italian Americans I mean they celebrate it as well\nAnd I know there's been push us to do these are indigenous peoples days and all that stuff I don't know why one ... infringe on the other but uh again as I said that the the hatred and they just taste for any\nOf the stories related to how this country was founded or created they're not as popular as they used to be\nA day and then the ... that is unraveling in front of a cat and threatening the affordability aren't they getting coverage for people listening to some conditions or lastly we have a battle in court right now\nBy which would declare not only the Affordable CARE Act unconstitutional [noise] but it would indeed sometimes or I Would release insurance if the obligation to cover people with preexisting conditions so we have some urgent and media that she is\nIf I could follow if you'll have thirty seconds now that I did not hear something on how you think we could pay for this Medicare for all is it going to require higher payroll taxes or income tax\n[noise] doing nothing I Would cost more\nClassic avoidance of an of a question or a good job Charles Manson for following up on that but you didn't answer the second time either this this nonsense that doing nothing costs more we have healthcare systems in place we have medical providers when insurance companies we have employers provided\nProviding health care we have a government provided health care\nAnd Medicare and Medicaid [noise]\nI'm not sure what she means by that in the end and clearly not documented about what she's talking but I Do I Do know this it cost trillions of dollars\nTo do what she's talking about\nHer debates her performance at that debate was pathetic for a sitting US Senator to to not be able to speak extend previously to just answer questions here is how I judge people's conversation when I'm Talking to someone one on one\nIf I ask you a question about something that you are supposed to be experienced in if I if I I ... I had a place you hesitating installing\nAnd not answering the direct question I ask ask you then I pretty quickly realized you you don't know what I'm Talking about or you know what you're talking about and that's what I saw last night so suffered Tammy Baldwin\nYou got to pick it up you may love the job but you're not doing the job [noise]\nAll right after the break US Senator Ron Johnson senior center from Wisconsin will join us ... me forty six you video on WGM gene joining me on the phone line now as US Senator Ron Johnson good morning senator\nRight Steve how're you doing I'm good I'm Glad you could spend a few minutes with us on the phone I wanted to ask you about a now that Brett Kavanaugh is sitting on the U.S Supreme Court that process you take away from a couple of months\nOf a what a lot of a ... extreme partisan battle by Democrats trying to blow up a guy's career frankly life your thoughts on that process and where we're at now\nIt was a maverick process no doubt about it and I think one of the white the money that they're really made an impression on me is when professor Ford made the comment that\nExcept for the infant itself for the last few weeks have been the worst for life about\nThose first two weeks weren't provided hurt by the Republican Party that was democratic operatives a that was her own attorneys who didn't apparently tell her that she could have done this privately in California\nUh but they barely never you told her that was a repeat it off or by the Senate Judiciary committee so maybe the other no worthy aspect is well for example very Baldwin he made a minder we said last night within forty eight hours I'm not exactly sure of the exact primary I'm Abbott so many Democrats completely\nA made up their mind before they even knew the nominee what they were going to be just ... I'm In complete you know they are used as an excuse\nMerrick Garland I'm Out America Again I send them back courtesy I don't know one Republican that tried to destroy America we're just very simply said within eight eight months of the country lecturing this would flip the court what struck the American people decide whether they want the Supreme Court flip\nFrom a more conservative court to issue activists court we watch the super legislators American people decided nobody tried destroyed\nMerrick Garland Democrats that was their goal from day one destroy a good man gets family it was a very sad very ugly episode and I hope people in in America I Hope the Oregon, Wisconsin noticed that\nAnd realize that that is who the Democratic that is what the Democratic Party is\nIt's somewhat ironic that a party who prides itself on on defending women at least they say that they do\nThrough through a Christine Blasey Ford to the fire and and frankly did nothing to protect her confidentiality you just talked about her honor her her dignity that was all thrown to the wolves because they wanted to take Brett Kavanaugh down\nThat they used her they wanted a show trial they wanted a spectacle they didn't care about professor Ford they wanted the spectacle and they got one and they harmed gold individuals'\nLasting lifetime harm for what for for their political games and gotten to the difference is is is dark we we just talk about the American people\nYou know side of the Supreme Court they went out to destroy judge Kavanaugh in the in the process they did a great deal of harm to their star witness was well it was really really ugly\nYou use the term false memories and an eye out for a lot of conservatives myself included I Believe you can believe that she believes what she's saying but also defend Brett Kavanaugh somebody was innocent of other of those accusations do you believe that's what she was going through\nI have no idea how you said there are a number of explanations you know mistaken identity false memories implanted memories I mean there there's so many explanations of why somebody could completely believed this by the way false memory Cory Booker ask him about it he made this claim that he did something\nOr some kind of sexual aggression toward a woman and he said he he did it while the the some line or some song from top gun was going through his head the only problem is top gun came out two years later\nSo they they don't want to one of those interrogators said history was called the victim of a false memory himself it happens all the time all I was trying to say there are multiple explanations why\nProfessor Ford can be so\nConvincing so compelling could completely believe what she was saying I'm I'm not telling me that she doesn't believe in something might have happened but there was no cooperation whatsoever and the and the bedrock principle of the American legal system is presumption of innocence there was no cooperation whatsoever so we have to assume\nJudge Kavanaugh was innocent and then you compare that assumption that presumption of innocence with the lifetime of achievement and all of the references all the women he's who is known going back to high school ... LBJ for him so he's he was a complete gentleman\nAnd none of this none of it sounded like the person they knew and they don't end well for twenty thirty thirty five years so\nYou got any access to the evidence in this case the evidence was Brett Kavanaugh was innocent and that's where we had to go on\nTalking to US Senator Ron Johnson do you think this will have long lasting impact on this process the next time a president selects Supreme Court nominee\nWell Democrats began the politics structurally came Supreme Court nominees with Robert Bork it's it's how we got divert working\nSo yeah it has had a long term effect and it gets down to Democrats sort of pushes all all the way even after Robert Bork you know Republicans confirmed Ruth Bader Ginsburg of complete\nParties in politics you know she counsel for the ACLU it doesn't get much more partisan that in many respects and yet Republicans tried to go back to\nThe comedy the cliche out the the the ... the respect for elections matter and presidents you don't have the have the expectation they can appoint judges and nominate cabinet officers of they're choosing\nHim if they're qualified they largely confined supported as Democrats violated that the that procedure so that it's going to have long lasting effects but it's because Democrats have been so horribly artist and he's confirmation battles\n... one of the interesting dynamics in Wisconsin coming into November as the the battle for the other us in a position Tammy Baldwin versus they certainly are who are you know state senator leave ... man what does she would she brings to that position\nWell first of all she's more of a system I just later she she was a nurse she's a mom in both of those titles say she's somebody who cares and I think last may the seat is well she she lives knowledgeable about the issues I'm In a senator summary\nThere couldn't be more stark difference between can evolve and he was always going to look for big government the nanny state\nTo design some solution that we don't want to work\nYou know Steve I mean I Am starting to tell you how many people think federal guards to fishing effective nobody raised their hand they laugh and you have evolved wants to grow\nThat she wants a single payer government run bureaucratic health care system for every American system like the VA that let down Jesus in custody in so many other veterans with long wait times\nAnd in less access to life saving drugs that don't Tammy Baldwin imposed on everybody the book where it because she actually served in\nMadison Paris about patient understands that a single payer government on your credit health care system is not what Americans want and it won't work and it will it will read it will require at a minimum\nIt was a leader who is chance to be it to be on the stage state wide really for the first time a much broader audience and I think that she did a very effective job and taking it to Tammy Baldwin\nThe other big issue was immigration border security Tammy Baldwin had I had was asked directly by revoke nearby what her plan was and and it affected me as well have a great use the term open borders and Democrats although they don't say that term all the all the ideas and policies things they talk about suggested that the reality\nBut tell me ball and raised in the issue of like a technology being the answer and and related to the wall your your thoughts on where she was kind of going with\nA willing Democrats talk about that the sitting excuse to do nothing is that they're going to say well we could do this that and the other thing and then they never do it it's kind of like how they authorized border security but then they never pay for it and sort of border security never actually happens [noise]\nUm that's that's the Democratic playboy you sound like you're going to do something about illegal immigration which you're really not in Tammy Baldwin has been rather depth on the issue of avoiding the whole thing about whether or not to abolish ice\nOr she's ... she's been saying that she is in favor of of abolishing ice with so many of our democratic colleagues at this point in our and if you don't have that the police agency doing the immigration enforcement here to have a lot of bad actors in this country and in Tammy Baldwin really needs to answer whether or not she disagrees with our colleague\nFunny asking voters question so as I said ... evolving effectively using the TV airwaves to tell her story to portray a candidate\nThat those of us who actually ... or ... or work as a U.S senator understand as as fiction but does that work with the voters are they seeing these ads and thinking oh my God Tammy carry cares about me as an individual and is that the way you you when these elections\nWhen I found was really interesting is how much leader who spent less than they talking about how Tammy doesn't care and how much we it does scare I mean and she was when she was talking about being a nurse\nShe was talking about very specific examples from her nursing experience and but also she was talking about how Tammy Baldwin says one thing in Washington DC and says something else when she's back home\nTrying to really stress the fact that there's a there's a divorce between the Tammy Baldwin that's on the commercials and the Tammy ... the real senator Tammy Baldwin I thought\nThat during the debate leader was very good at pushing their point\nOne of the things I've said about Santa Barbara for a while as a follower NATO leader as a new center and that's\nNot unusual but typically when you're good at what you do whether it's politics or what our private sector whatever it is at some point the leaders emerged and I just don't see those qualities in Tammy Baldwin but yet it still seems to be playing with the voters in Wisconsin can can live ... flip that switch and turn that around\nWell I think so when you look at what Ron Johnson did in his first term compared to\nTammy Baldwin in her first term is it's a difference of night and day we had a very effective senator and Senator Ron Johnson we had a very ineffective senator and Tammy Baldwin a she's still proposing things that that Republicans proposed in an effort to try and curry favor with the voters but she's not going to move on most issues either\nShe only get get things done when she absolutely has to win it's election time and that's when she comes up with things but as we saw last night she really doesn't ever command of those issues\nWhat's what's ... what's your biggest vulnerabilities ... looking at Tammy Baldwin's campaign and her tenure as you as a U.S senator what's your biggest vulnerability thing\nOr biggest vulnerability what's the fact that the brewers already had beaten Colorado so there were more people tuned in last night as they resolve that debate right if the birds are actually playing last night Tammy Baldwin would have been a lot better off and she better hope that the brewers are playing the same day as the next debate\nI you know again I I started a couple of times already on on the hour or so I've been on the air and I I was I was shocked at how bad she was at a debate that she should have been prepared for given all the time she had to get ready for this thing\nAnd and the inability to answer simple questions\nTo stumble over answers that clearly memorize some information that ... and I'll go back to the point memorizing things is good if you're if you're a good speaker but if you're not a good speaker what it what happens is that exposes your lack of experience and your lack of knowledge about a subject that's what I think got exposed last night's well the\nInteresting thing to me is that with all of her experiences as being a senator or she clearly wasn't to prepare for last night and that that says to me something about the way that she's been handling your job it seems to be a I'm going to coast through and get a gift to five years and you know for somebody who\nThan than panicking about her job ever since the whole movie a scandal you would have thought that she had been better prepared did you buyers her responses to that issue when it came up no it really if you do\nThis has been a a cleanup job ever since and I think the live nearby challenging here the way you lead she did a really drove that issue home and are\nYou one thing we got to say about the moderators last like those were not hard questions and even even leave ... there should have been handled the equal pay question better right I mean that was her big weak point of the evening but those were pretty softball questions we're not talking about that she got real by by the attorney\nLast night there wasn't a questionnaire that they shouldn't have expected right it's subject matter was one of the health care first Fifteen minutes everybody knew that was common immigration for security those were not surprises James way to send the editor right Wisconsin join me on a Tuesday edition is usually here on Monday after the break the week ahead for concern us we're also following a breaking news from Washington DC\nNikki Haley resigning as US ambassador to carry out some updates on that though in a little bit of\nPresident Trump is going to speak from the oval office with Nikki Haley at the bottom of the hour we'll try to defend that\nAll right so that that coverage coming up right here on WGM Jan Brewer story ended up getting coverage Todd cast ticket links galleries find everything brewers on their hunt for the first World Series title on your mobile device brewers for one for seven nine nine wants to be twenty for the latest on the crew we're all about the brewers as they marched to be an LDS\nI should say and I'll see us rather we already took care of business man oh ds are joining this morning James witnessing the editor right Wisconsin is usually joined the money they want you I'm\nSure there's debate I'm gonna I'm gonna flip topics on you or the than announcements kind of shocking announced with Nikki Haley will be leaving as UN ambassador any thoughts on where that storyline might go\nWell it's very interesting timing is before the midterms and so given are high ratings that's not somebody that's being fired just because you want to try to impress the voters backed quite the opposite Nikki Haley is very popular with the conservative base\nOr she certainly the one that people talk about this the shining star in the Trump Administration\nSo I Would imagine that you defect to that it's going to be a joint appearance with with President Trump leads us to believe that there's\nReasons completely divorced from the idea that it's a it's a performance issue or policy disagreement issue and a ... he's going to be very curious to see what the reasons are for her deciding to resign down\nAnd we're going to carry some coverage if if if it goes live uh right after the bomb the our news and are ready to be the object so quickly the week ahead for conservatives\nWhat to look for [noise] so we're going to be seeing a new Marquette law school pull coming out tomorrow and uh that's always fun for people like me were little the political junkies we're going to be having our popcorn ready to\nTo watch those numbers pop out or we're going to have full coverage on right was confident that because obviously this is this may be the last Marquette law school or work before the election\nAnd we're looking at numbers that ... you know who knows where these people are going to

Kavanaugh\nAnd his decision on who he hired I can guarantee you're not hearing that story on CNN\n\nThat's nine thirty six the city with you on this Tuesday soon as you\nKnow if you're listening yesterday we launched air bill ... how do you change acres initiative raised a V. and we had ... however many studio and today it was their daughter who who was killed in the nine eleven attacks in New York City and to me a bill that brings us her story\nMm WGM daycares presented by first financial center in the center of the Washington right now since the steel beams that we've been discussing suing the middle\nOf the world Trade Center it was in the north tower it's currently on the ground in stone it looks beautiful even now but the hope is to raise this be making it the focal point of Wisconsin nine eleven memorial that will honor Andrea but so much more\nKeith is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Kate Hi Clark area\nGreat thank you you got a question for me about boosting your credit score correct\nI'm looking to buy my first home this year and basically true my credit union my rates are determined by my credit score so I have maybe about ten K. saved up right now I Am\nGrowing it every paycheck and I have some days in collections that negatively affected my store and I'm just wondering you know well it helped my score to pay them off and and take that on my savings and pay the collection debt\nOff or am I better keeping that cash on hand for my down payment on my house I've read on line that even if you pay off things that are already in collections that has a zero impact on your credit score\nSo if you have a collection on your report that is the main factor and what happens with your credit so if you pay off\nAn old item ... will raise your score potentially some but it depends on the scoring model being used how much effect it has so the newest scoring models like the newest psycho model\nGives you a good bump into your credit score if you take an active collection and\nSatellite pay it and it's now report is a zero balance but the lender has to be using the newest model of the psycho scoring which just completely depends on the credit grander\nYeah so it's not whether one of the three credit bureaus are using the latest model it's based on the credit union and what they're even\nExactly so as an example the one that takes into account how you handle past what excuse the term what they were called bad behavior and you've turned it or you've turned it around and you've taken care of something the model known as spike over nine\nIs the one that the credit union would have to be using as I understand it for there to be a meaningful impact on your score paying off and old item\nI mean generally wants an old item hit seven years if vanishes anyway\nMy follow up on that is a one of the items and collections of um twenty eleven but it looks like when I'm On my credit report and now shows twenty Fifteen like maybe there was some way that the gate got refreshed or is that\nThat is the term that I use for it and that is an illegal activity on the part of whoever is reporting that debt unless you took some kind of action on it in twenty fifteenth so what you do is you challenge the date was known as the date of last activity for it\nGot it and generally they don't want to fight with somebody who knows that's how the rules work that's how the law works so you would challenge that item not being on your report that the date\nThat that item is on your report because the aging of it is so important and you contact both whoever the collection agency is reporting it as twenty Fifteen and said a ... eleven you challenge with them and the credit bureau\nGot it okay so ...\nHow many I Know as far as there that are these old items and collection\nThat depends on which bureau I have as little as two one zero and as many as four and another one\nIn or they generally in the age back like early this decade or some of the more recent\nThe most recent one I Would say is four to five years ago\nOkay so that one's got a little clock time to run but the thing is is that the whole idea of credit scoring is that you're not in a credit purgatory forever\nThe ones that period of time passes even if you don't pay on the debt they disappear and you have a fresh start\nSo you're getting this or that but settling the one\nTrying to get credit right now exactly and so the first thing for me is just to talk to the credit union and just ask them if they're using the ...\nAnd the person you talked to was a loan officer that will know if it's just somebody at the credit union they're not going to know and you ask them how do they make a determination on making alone\nIn the event that you have a zero balance is on these old items will that change the loan approval process for them there is a great explanation about what happens when older items on credit reports\nAt a website you may have heard me mentioned from time to time credits sesame dot com go read their briefing on what happens with collection items and the different scenarios that apply\nJim joins us on the Clark Howard show Jim you have an idea you want to share with your fellow listener about emergency savings fun is that true\nThat's true so clock I er I already max out my retirement or a threw rocks and I for like Kay [noise] and I've got a [noise] money sitting in the emergency fund obviously for emergency [noise]\nLike a it's a pretty good chunk of money and I was toying with the idea of taking maybe I don't know half of it and putting it into a target retirement fund that either recently passed\nKnowing that the you know that they're trying to keep someone who is retired or about to retire and try to keep their money you know from from going down obviously I Know there's no guarantee that I was wondering what your thoughts were doing something like that in order to maybe a little bit of money on that\nI think that is a very low risk strategy to try to do some return on your rainy day money right and so going into a host retiree portfolio which is what you're doing I think that's a very viable strategy\nObviously a someone who's already in retirement they've they lose more correspondence with stocks I Know is the interest rates go up on ... I won't be looking so hot\nThat is true but you know the whole idea about how they do one of those portfolios is where I mean you could even go into a balance fun that's fifty percent stocks fifty percent fixed income or bonds and the idea is that the risk counteract each other you'd have to have a perfect storm\nFor you to lose a substantial amount of money with either scenario\nAnd even though you're a hundred percent correct It's interest rates rise the value of bonds will go down if you're concerned about that you could build your own portfolio using in a short or ultra short bond fund\nAnd using a lower risk stock portfolio stock fund portfolio and eliminate a lot of the bond interest rate risk\nBut the idea of as somebody who's a Mac saver like U. of taking a lot of your rainy day money and investing it at a low risk kinds of pointed this scale I think is great\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Chris how can I serve you today\nOr thinking about surgery surgery and a ... year year and a half hour or so\nAnd I've seen so many ... a ... dollar and then there's some ... ... dollars and I just want to know\nSo this is this is a tough one because this is where the wildlife meets medicine and science so there are high volume chains are used to be a lot more through the shakeout phase with lasik\nRight there are the volume chains they charge like two fifty three hundred and three fifty and I\nAnd then there are the boutique places that do you say they charge several thousand dollars and I was like and this one is one of those things that does not have\nA right answer when you go to the high volume chains you have the benefit to the uh the model just doing the procedure dies a ton of them and there's an advantage\nWith medical procedures when someone has a great deal of experience\nBut also you are in a basically a factory and assembly line and if you have issues or problems later\nThe difficulty you might have with one of the high volume discounters is there any follow through is extra any what they call the euphemism enhancements\nYou know enhanced wants means and like surgery okay a lot of people may not be aware that after you have an idea and you may need a follow up surgery that it that it may not have gone exactly just like planned\nAnd with a high volume discounters you will usually pay every time they do any kind of follow up\nInvesting can be very overwhelming it may seem like the firm handling your money knows everything and you understand very little\nEducation always comes first they're drinking associates or number one priority is to make sure you're just as knowledgeable as the advisors or drinking associates we can't predict market movements with any certainty\nBut we can expect to retirement lasting twenty or Thirty years to see periods of decline retirement strategies predicated on steady returns may fall short one market swing a solid retirement plan that takes into account a variety of market conditions can help you weather the storm drinking associates operas educational workshops on retirement planning\nAnd Social Security strategy you get more information and wells Wisconsin dark Tom\nDrake an associates where education always comes first visit in ...

John\nPike working at three weeks off you start getting a job congratulations\nAnd believe me this jogging one week and I'm hoping to put an awful lot of the house today are kind of being a transitional period where I don't have a job\nTrying to go through the way they process that I saw the vendors are probably not going to give me alone in that situation what if your wife to tap into your contribution to a lot better right when my wife and my my own ... in order to find a house\nSo you have enough money saved and Ross the you could just write a check from your Ross and own your home mortgage free\nIt would probably be a combination of that and save a life in your house\nOr their accounts today would be a close\nEye that's extraordinary but I'd like to talk you away from that because once the money is out of the Roth even though you can pull all your contributions tax penalty free the money's not there to continue to grow tax free you can't replenish it that quickly how old are you and your wife\nThirty seven\nWhere you could replenish a lot of money and the next Thirty years so that's not completely true but I said but the advantage of you having a mortgage is interest rates are so favorable right now\nAnd the money and the Roth is likely to al earn it if you have a diversified across um stock type investments chair\nSo on the mortgage thing you are still at your current job correct for one more week\nYou would want to get free qualify for alone now is your wife working outside the home she has not no okay so it's kind of rely completely on your income yes you have how many years history at your existing job\nI have two years of my current job\nThey and before that how long did you have your prior job\nAh probably about six years\nOkay don't sound like a loan officer sorry [laughter] so you have the work history you will have a work\nPresent at your new job I Would think would I Would do is I Would call a mortgage broker now and talk to him or her about what's going to be involved in you qualifying for a loan lending standards have become more favorable to borrowers this year\nAnd I think with the history the fact that you have so much money saved do you know is your credit score solid\nYeah it it is very good I think you can do alone and I want you to do alone instead of eating up your raw money\nOkay that sounds great\nI mean you using the raw as a way to pay cash for home would work if there was like a screaming deal on a home for whatever circumstances you ... can't qualify for a mortgage then you do something that is not unusual way of paying for it\nBut you're circumstance doesn't fit that Steven's with us on the\nClark Howard show Hi Stephen Hi you've got some issues with that you want to run by me [noise] let me hear\nRoughly about nine thousand dollars a credit card debt right now which ah we're working on trying to create a plan to go down\nWell I'm Glad for that how many years did it take you to get to the twenty nine thousand\nA little less than three that's quick was there a period of unemployment or medical issues mixed them they're\nA little bit of a life we had a child [noise]\nAlmost two years ago and the medical bills from that but also this the show I had er stayed at home and I was working a job and a half hour or so for a while [noise] um I'm working one job now mostly with overtime and now she just came back to work now she's going to go back part time [noise]\nUm let's see if we can make amends with that I'm trying to make a climate down\nWhile I got a plan for you the money that she's going to make net of whatever childcare expenses you have the entire rest of the mountain goes towards\nThe credit card debt [noise]\nI mean that is that is the simple is back in the envelope way because then it's not trying to figure okay so we should send but so much money here and so much money there\nAnd I'm a big fan of doing a ladder where you pay the minimum ... towards the lowest interest rate credit card debt you have and what's the highest DEA of one of those dislike screaming highlight Mount Everest twenty five percent\nOr ... we know that some of the store is that we try to eat and then pay right off the guy with a card [noise] um but it's um [noise] can nine nine\nNine oh that's great so you're not paying back breaking interest so that means of your payments an enormous amount of your payment will go towards principle yes that's great what's the lowest rate you have on a card\nTo buy it gets around nine [noise]\nOkay so it's a pretty close spread in that case without a big gap in the interest rate from highest the lowest\nYou could do something that a lot of people find psychologically rewarding and instead pay minimum ... against all your cards except the one that has the lowest balance\nRight [noise] and white that one out because you don't have that much interest rate swing from one to another psychologically for a lot of people it feels better\nWhen you were able to get rid of a card how many cars the total do you have\nOne boy\n[laughter] oh you only have four in total\nI of course she has one in\nFive so whatever the lowest balance on one of them is put your big efforts from her new paychecks and that is that's paid off go to the one with the next lowest balance and that way you feel like you're really making progress is the balance comes down what so neat when the overall balance comes down\nEach check that she gets has so much more impact\nAs a ... percent of the overall remaining balance now another strategy you can do is the thing I talk about paying down your debt Thirteen months were your goal would be in this case you pay a roughly a thousand dollars a month for thirty months\nAnd end up completely credit card debt free\n[noise] because people can see their way to thirty month go you start looking sixteen months it gets a lot harder [noise] I don't know if she's going to earn the\nKind of money at the job she's taking that she net out enough money for you to throw a thousand cards\nYeah I'm not I don't think so are you from this company she coming in from\nSo the net amount so take then that amount and just keep attacking it and I promise as you see the balances come down you feel so much better\nAnd you have so much more sense of control so the amount you owe is a burden but not a backbreaking one\nSo I I Wish you the best way that I Love it if next spring you call me back and let's do a checkup and see what kind of progress you made with the credit card balances any suggestions I might have at that time gel joins us Jill you need some advice for your ...\nPolice or something you know age [laughter]\nHow old is your mom eighty one\nEighty one okay so she is she's a typical eighty

couple of different things first off you get a general rising water out ahead of the eye of the storm\nDue to that low pressure that low pressure pushes down the water water shoves out ahead of that and then you get the highway and you get the high winds and it's just basically a wall of water that sometimes moves very very fast\nDoes not give people a lot of time you know it's one thing if you got a river rising like a foot per a eight hours while it's different if you get that wall of water to ride in a matter of seconds\nAnd putting them rising as as an ski team Jay forced me around just

like ten inches twelve inches of rain which is still a lot of rain but not the thirty forty inches of rain\nOr that we saw with Harvey in Houston and with Florence or in the Carolinas so that's one good thing with this system but ah the speed though I guess the tradeoff is\nIt's not going to have any time to really weaken significantly in fact it looks like it's just a gaining strength here so

for the franchise wouldn't that be wouldn't that be a story to talk about for a while that would definitely make all four of the four at Sam I'm number three of our for our town Nikki Haley was a big decision yesterday announced a we had it on our airwaves\nA decision to resign and for her position as UN ambassador to the United nations and\nThere's a lot of speculation about this story and uh you know she said yesterday there's no personal reason that you said it's a very important for government officials to understand when it's time to step aside some speculation and there's always like tuition with these issues especially with this administration which has had high\nTurnover is that she simply wants to make more money um she's a child in college another one on the way to college um the sources are saying that she may just want to make some more money than anybody that's worked in his administration\nHave found lots of opportunities to cash in after the fact now I'm somebody and it said Nikki Haley\nCould be a future president\nFormer governor of South Carolina you an imbalance that are well respected well thought of rising star in the Republican Party this could be a pause if\nShe ever decided she wants to pursue that and I'm running for president is no easy task is asking her Walker\nAnd some of the other dozen or so candidates who ran against president Donald Trump not an easy situation so some of the other names being thrown out no specifics yet but I'm\nOne of them is um you just find it here quickly for you agree now Richard right now is the ambassador US ambassador to Germany Richard now he's also the senior advisor to the the daughter of the president evocative Trump whose whose name the president discussed yesterday\nIn relation disposition but he kept using the word nepotism which he says wouldn't apply but I think most of us would say probably not a good look that that that you couldn't do the job she sounds like a very smart woman and frankly replacing\nNikki Haley was another one probably be a smart play by the president and just from the PR aspect of this administration is somebody who worked in PR you know former life I think it's important that they understand where we're at\nWhy that matters and to do everything they can to defuse that democratic talking point when it comes to women are minorities in the cabinet\nThere's there's things you can do to manage these discussions and there's\nSome of it on unwarranted some of the the controversy surrounding this administration and you can do that by doing the right things adding another woman to replace Nikki Haley would be smart\nUm it's a job that frankly is grinding and she was very involved in the north Korea a\nSummit in Singapore working alongside the or the secretary of state and as as somebody who has led us states she gets what's involved and she understands the dynamics of the position but I think frankly can wear on you and somebody has as I said one kid in college one on the way\nThat's an important time of your life\nAnd I've seen it with other elected officials you make a decision at some point even Paul Ryan to some extent who wants to spend more time with his family after a twenty year career\nAs a congressman and now as speaker of the house sometimes family does dictate your future doesn't mean it's the end of your political career and for Nikki Haley I I Hope not because I think as I said I think she's a ... a rising star\nAnd I and I and I think the Republicans would miss an opportunity to to elevate a woman to a position as vice president of presidents before Democrats do that because it again and steals that talking point and it's especially somebody as qualified as Nikki Haley so lots\nLots of a discussion swirling around this president says he'll have a decision and a couple of weeks she has a short list now he says um and it's going to I'm\nGoing to be his decision and I said he has names he told reporters Dina Powell is another one of those names or she is a a deputy national security advisor so there's there's names out there but uh he has not revealed his shortlist yet coming up number four of the four at ten\nAnd they need to shake that is killing their school district and hopefully at some point to realize that and education is a big part of the Governor Walker Tony Evers races well\nGovernor Walker has called himself the education governor and Tony raises push back and said that's nonsense but the reality is the governor has pumped more money in the schools in the last budget something that Tony

September thirtieth\nTallied all that information of evaluating comments from the anchors reporters voters that the people that they interviewed voters experts experts in quotes\nAnd what this shows in that nearly two thirds of the evening news coverage of the Trump presidency has been focused on just five main topics the Russia investigation immigration\nKavanaugh nomination those hearings North Korea those that relationship between Kim Jong own and the president summit diplomacy and then the U.S relations with Russia\nAnd what they found that the majority the vast majority of this discussion on network broadcast networks nightly news Ninety two percent has been negative Ninety two percent\nSo I'm thinking about this as somebody who talks about politics and I talked to a lot of Republicans about the president and one of the overriding things they tell me is they loved the work this president has done to bring back the economy\nTo give manufactures and people who hire people and pay their salaries and make things or provide services a reason to feel optimistic\nAnd yet I just told you the five topics economy and economic development is not even in any of those topics\nAnd when

I I think surprises in the new law school poll I Am not surprised that\nScott Walker has clawed ahead of Tony Evers forty seven forty six I have heard from sources\nOff the record or at least not can use it at the time\nThere are numbers that show that race had got drawn to about even that's a that's a tie I mean obviously statistically Senate\nLast month in September\nAn eleven point lead fifty thirty to forty two overly ... senator Tammy Baldwin over state senator ... fifty three forty two I expected that race to tighten dramatically\nFit tightened by\nFifty three to forty three versus fifty three to forty two that's\nFascinating\nIs I I did not expect that here's where this this gets really interesting the attorney general's race also has tightened\nRatchet will forty seven challenger Josh coal forty three in September shovel forty eighth call forty one I did not expect that race to tighten I did expect the Senate race to type more I mean\nIt didn't tighten going from eleven to ten is so statistically insignificant especially with margin of error you can say that that race is on changed that's that's what you have in the Senate race\nFor ... because I I expected some awkward movement\nBad news for ... I Do not expect downward movement while he is numbers and drop but a tightening of the race just drop it point\nWalker I expected to be right there a point one way or the other\nThe News I'm going to

seventh just past few days\nSo this is a fresh poll\nEverything that went on all things\nKavanaugh don't appear to have really had any impact\nOn the Senate race here in Wisconsin I Am flabbergasted by that\nUh on the Senate race there comes down to wanting to keep the executive branch in check\nWell that's that's interesting\nBecause I mentioned earlier there are at least some\nLiberals in the state the thing Democrats should\nJust completely turn this into a referendum on Kavanaugh slashed Trump\nAnd remember Brett Kavanaugh or maybe more appropriately remember Merrick Garland or remember Dr forward I don't know\nWhatever inspiration to left on the game from that\nThere may be something to say for that\nSomeone else asked to the polls taken before or after the debate um yeah I I just I I don't think that that's a major factor\nI think what you have to look at here is is the Kavanaugh factor present I I just I don't know how to measure that because when you look at the state races they're split\nWalker is pop\nI shouldn't say that Walker now leads by a bit but he's really turn that around\nSymbols race has tightened\nAnd then you've got just nothing\nNothing moving\n[noise] the

don't the numbers match okay\nBecause and this has been discussed and that's a great question\nIt's called ticket splitting\nThat there are in fact people and this is what makes that this is what makes the numbers fascinating\nBecause there are those who say that it's possible that Tammy Baldwin could win and Scott Walker could when in fact almost from the beginning it was believed that is how Walker was going to have to win by winning I'm the same day is Tammy Baldwin\nWhy so why does that happen because there are people who will vote for Scott Walker who in fact will not vote\nFor le ... teams to believe but the argument has been\nThat if you had a ten or eleven point race\nThere is no way you know in the Senate race that Walker could overcome that that he would have to have so much ticket splitting going on that that didn't make sense this fall would say yeah\nThat could happen\nThat in fact could at the\nCenter of all when as a temp point lead Governor Walker they use tides

I think at this point the American public needs to know definitively whether it was true or false do they not\nI I I think that certainly is that something that should be looked at that something that we should try to determine\nWhether we can ever know definitively exactly what happened I I we may well have a he said he said sort of situation here\nI'm One of the problems is these things comments get made in private\nPerson per season one way and someone takes them another way and it's very difficult to sort out after the fact\nWhat was actually meant and I think President Trump would himself would be very\nForgiving of comments that were made in private that\nMay have been taken the wrong way\nSo we really do need to to figure out what happened but I also I mean one thing we have concern of is that\nRod Rosenstein is\nThat he was the chief assistant for attorney general fashions\nAnd one of his job is to advise attorney general sessions and I am no way saying that President Trump should be a recorded by his subordinates or anything like that\nOne of the one of his constitutional job just to advise attorney sessions about what he thinks about President Trump\nNow we're getting into a political issue about\nExactly should be done\nI don't think that we should rush to judgment and decide based on one news report that somehow Rod Rosenstein incredibly stellar\nHistory as the longest serving us attorney in the country who was appointed by President Bush served under Obama and confirmed Ninety four to six by the Senate in this current position that one story is somehow going to\nEradicate all that we really to give them the benefit of the doubt\nTalking with Chris Truax or a Republican but the rule of law in a piece for ... last month an opinion piece\nOf protect Mueller's Russia investigation you wrote it's not just about Trump or even mostly about Trump it's about a very well documented attacks on our democracy slush sat out what do you mean by that\nWe tend to forget that the real point of the Mueller investigation is not\nReally to investigate whether Donald Trump's campaign had somehow colluded with Russia and he's really to investigate how Russia interfered with the twenty sixteen election and Mueller has done that were work there I mean he's indicted twenty five different Russian buying names\nFor either interfering in the election or hacking the Democratic party various email service\nSo he's actually done it you know and he's not done yet but so far he's produce very real very solid result\nAnd if you don't have to say that if President Trump would stop talking\nAbout collusion and which ones\nYou wouldn't even know that somehow Donald Trump's campaign might be implicated in this mess\nBecause Mueller has been running a very tight ship but he's been doing a very good job and he should be allowed to finish that job\nTalking with Chris Truax so I assume that you were hurting the by what the president said this week I look I've known as the firing a\nRod Rosenstein I I I absolutely was and you know when President Trump is wrong I'm the first one to stand up and say it's wrong but when he's right I'm happy to say that he's right and that was absolutely the correct decision\nRod Rosenstein is a straight down in the middle kind of guy\nAnd he's he's really dedicated to an apolitical department of justice and the rule of law and that's exactly the kind of people that we need in his position\nSo good for you know President Trump he gets point for me for that absolutely\nSo cheers were I'm stuck on this because I mean I ... in principle I I'm a conservative who agrees with you on this Chris that I've I've said all along I wanted to Republicans to do more to protect the investigation Rosenstein andme alert but\nI'm telling you I mean\nIf someone in that high level did do this and I'm not saying you didn't either but I think it's a really big deal\nThat possibly this happen and if ... if Rod Rosenstein did this Sunday he should speak publicly and say why he felt it was necessary but I to me it seems like it's a pretty big shadow was over the government but you don't seem to be there yeah\nI I'm not there yet simply because we've\nWe've seen these stories sort of\nEvaporate before um and I come back to the fact that\nAndrew McCabe does the forest for all of that\nUm he's now we're talking about what Andrew McCabe told\nA a another attorney there the attorney for the FBI\nAnd remember that Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein\nDo not get along\nThey have been at they were at loggerheads pretty much throughout this entire period so you know two weeks ago we had this report from Andrew McCabe these memos that he had reported a that that Rosenstein suggested wearing a wire will you talk to Tom and that caused the big\nBig ... and you know Rod Rosenstein went to the White House et cetera et cetera\nAnd now two weeks later\nWe have somebody that Andrew McCabe talked to saying yeah Andrew McCabe talk to me about this\nIt really the same story just\nVersion to the same story and it's not any more I'm not any more convinced by the fact that the editor McCain told somebody something then by the fact that he wrote it down\nSo and people at the meeting as I say that the exact comment was what you want me to do Andy wear a wire\nAnd if that was the case but clear sarcasm and that was in fact he was actually pushing back\nAgainst the cave and protecting the president if that was the actual comment\nSo I'm not there yet I agree we need to see what exactly happened President Trump seems to be okay or he had a a long talk with a with Rosenstein I think it was yesterday day before yesterday\nAnd he seems to be okay with it\nAnd so sure Congress and investigative it likes but we shouldn't really be rushing to condemn Rod Rosenstein at this point because he has done a stellar job under extremely try and conditions\nPush tracks all Republicans for the rule of all things a lot for joining us thank you so much for having me Jerry I always look forward to\nTolerate or I or I'm going to have more to say about this I'm going to want your thoughts I I Do not see eye to eye with Chris on

I'm not saying that world wave\nBut what I'm saying is I think you're going to look at it very limited for Democrats probably enough to pick out still\nBut I think they're I think they're going to lose ground is is that it might not apple might not have lost and they just what break down a path on a fifty two forty vote or\nTo the Supreme Court you know just as a normal normal hearing process I think that there's still a little bit of a sleeping giant that's been awoken last two weeks I think it's going to go to sleep in the next three\nI and I and I do think you're right about the Senate that that I think that dynamic has changed or in the two minutes of the way I've left I Want your thoughts on this I'm going to take it up after the news so now Scott Walker the incumbent essentially tied with Tony reverse I can tell you there was a raging internal debate among Republican strategist\nThe pimps is here in the state a vice president for Walker there's debate over whether Trump should campaign your friend do you think that would be a good or bad idea\nI Know better than me Jerry on this [laughter] yeah I mean honestly he didn't win Wisconsin won Wisconsin because Hillary Clinton didn't turn out Democrats but he did win Wisconsin and he was effective in the journal but not in the\nTelling you looked at the Marquette University poll that have come out with\nThe first election the recall election when\nUm they always in the Governor Walker losing losing losing and then as it approaches all of a sudden he went through the forty eight\nI think the same thing's going to happen this time around\n... and the one oh today actually has him up by a point\nRight on the breaking him up a point a little bit earlier than we\nHave shown in the past but they've got all the little your third liberal so\nI'm I'm pretty proud of it and and Governor Walker's ray\nBut thanks a lot for the call it you know we didn't know if he needs it but he didn't get the question is I guess multiple questions does he need it and what does it help or hurt I don't know I I Am just taking opinions here to Tom in Sheboygan Tom go at\nA hearing Michael I'm\nI I agree with both callers um and I might have thought of that I think that Mike Pence is more of a neutral person the cars are safe enough and younger side\nOf whether she likes the manner knows the man where Trump I think if he's a senator doesn't like the right direction it's going you would say I never met the man I don't know the man\nThat kind of dance and then the other problem is is the speaker of the house Paul Ryan when Trump or trumped up there in my opinion from what I've seen and what I've heard\nTrump's not really fond of the Scott Walker I'm\nPaul Ryan a connection and and I think Trump would choose not even come you're not even do I think quite and is more or that if he doesn't do it nobody was\nInteresting thanks a lot for the call and then the question and I guess maybe even a better question what about we moved here she is down still in the latest poll although her internal shorter closer does she need Donald Trump does she need anything at this point or do you not take the pull that seriously\nTo Nick in Janesville Nick is going to break the streets here go ahead\nYeah I mean I don't understand the the computer age and I mean that just looked at the look at the rally they'd been at the last couple of weeks she you know I\nThink it's people fired up you know why wouldn't you want that here in Wisconsin you know I mean that that's a no brainer [noise]\nWell the concern is that it will energize the Democratic base\nYeah but it also helps people come out there you know want to\nKeep up with some of the things I was ... and and the guy at work or have done such a good job you

joining us next time if\nI say you know in regard to the announcers I think Bob process and his partner\nI think they had the mentality that they were the show rather than the players\nAnd it just it was a pet peeve of mine\nWhen uh they couldn't pronounce RC his name properly and they couldn't pronounce ethical ours name properly it just showed that they hadn't watched the ... been knowledge about the brewers through the season and and I don't think they deserve to be commented on earth but I told your producer that one\nThing I liked about that last game was air crafts being like\nThe guy is just so genuine and humble that his comments were great and I like this conversation back and forth with the umpire and like I told your producer if if and they'll be what might the catchers and the first base men\nThey they could charge exorbitant amount of money and people would subscribe to hear those conversations going on behind the plate and you always see the first baseman talking to the runners here that people would pay a premium and uh you know I went to a number of games this year\nThere's no announcers that knowing that I'm interested in so I also agree with your last sixty seven year old ban that I don't really need the announcers do enjoy watching the game\nI was pine for the call right now I also did did so it's a romance of baseball's sort of thing you there's some great calls in baseball history I still time for that and uh maybe it's just a product of my role as any other sports broadcaster but a point well taken here and that\nI you know it it just it it some old school guys I'm a new school baseball is going to be some things that don't really make sense ... but I'm the sense that I got his guys like cost us we're seemingly unprepared so\nThey didn't know much about the brewers and that was that sense I got asked for craft you know we talk about this lake before but baseball is in need of stars another thing aircraft as a star but he becomes a lovable figure in kind of a cult hero especially in Milwaukee\nAnd slowly but surely as you get to know more about these guys if it catches on it becomes a little bit more nationwide beyond just regionalized here was aircraft might up during that game three against the Rockies\nFirst manager Craig council address the media a little earlier today at Miller Park a team just finishing up some batting practice do workout again tomorrow and then it's game one on a friday here's what the manager Craig council have to say earlier today\nIt looks like they're going to start to read left these out of the first four games for instance that change anything I Would watch trails do or not to the life I I Know sometimes when you face left these you would play blues or travel or not a thing\nBut I think you have played them both sometimes too so just wondering\nI Know yell it's just not a factor because he has a\n[noise] yeah I mean [noise] you know they they have a a very left handed a rotation [noise] um [noise]\nAnd um you know it'll\nIt'll it means you're going to see different line of I'm kind of regularly as what I Will tell you so you won't see one line up [noise] um well they'll be more guys kind of in the starting lineup and [noise] um [noise]\nYou know we're we're we think we have the players for it I'm like you say seemed different in different names and the story line because of it\nI had some of the guys kills alive is he answered I Do have other guys in mind us the money thing for today in order to keep those options open\nYeah well we're gonna we're gonna do um [noise]\nWe are going to do some more lie BP later in the day\nI'm mainly for some hitters that I'm just want to see some just want to see live just wants the velocity dense [laughter] you know it's it's [noise] we\nWe can't replicate the game [noise] um and we won't stand this but it's a little bit closer and for the guys that wanted to um the less them obviously stays the velocity\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo we'll we'll do that a little bit today and um yesterday [noise] you know we did it for ... years um Santa we also have some guys swinging the bats are today was it really is more for the guy swinging the bats\nTalked a lot about the veteran guys have been down this road before he was so young guys that you had that happen habits experience before ... house where he was the way they react to the spotlight on the play offs and the first series [noise]\nYeah I mean I [noise]\nYou know I think our guys town while and I mean I'm I'm it's I don't um [noise]\nYou know ... these guys are capable hanging on and I I don't put that as something that's just guys yelling he can't handle the situation I don't look at it like that at all um I I think that's a really shallow way to look at it um [noise]\nYou know to me you know harming burns on his major league debut recording to winning save 'em\nYou know that tells you everything you need it now um and and what he did up to that point is the reason why he was in that situation so [noise] you know the guys that are on the roster and young guys all guys there on the roster for reasons because we we believe they can ... believe they're going to rise to the occasion and give us a chance of success\nOn so [noise] you know I don't think um [noise]\nIt's I don't think age is narrow or even experience is necessarily a a relevant factor oh is it how are you going to handle the situation and then and we've had a guy that I Believe there's the guys that are on the roster are equipped to handle the situation\nLocking that stands out in the postseason games are far gone has like totally banished even compared to\nVery least is um when you think back to your postseason you see like a very dramatic change there and for you\nGaining through these games because that's just\nPart of the equation anymore like even come up in the dugout ferry awesome\n\nWell I think [noise] yeah I mean I think it's ... there's there's a number of reasons for us um [noise]\nAnd um you know I I don't want to go into all\nThe reasons exactly but it's but it's there's a number of reasons for it it's still considered at times um [noise] but I think I think putting players in a position to be successful and is also a part of the equation and and and that's not about like everybody should be able to bond that I think that's what it says that's not\nI don't think that's where you can start with the\nYou know the argument that people should on [noise] um there's other reasons there's reasons why it's in a lot of cases and in today's game it's harder to bond\nVelocity has changed the bunting equation um\nIt just ... and that's that's that's part of that so [noise] you know strategically I'm with matchups I think there are still times that it might be it is the right thing to do now in the game state but um [noise]\nYou know we we haven't found those situations and haven't had the person our I think it's the best play\nCricket you go back to the um\nTime when you guys ... there was a little bit of talk at least initially about him potentially planes from second base you know a travel is that he never did that does that kind of an indication of just how well Travis took to the physician out while he's done with a sense\nYeah I think you know when we when we made the train we we did talk about it for sure and um because I don't look we didn't have all the answers to that question of what now Travis what's going to look I mean I you know the art of the reason why we made the trade is because we saw Travis could do it um but we didn't have any game experience to go on\nAnd so I'm\nTravis as you know basically through his play um proven to me and to us that he can do it and then he said he can succeed at it would be good at it and I'm ... from our and it's it's made it easier to to instead of a\nKind of moving those guys around and making them ...\nBoth uncomfortable and switching back and forth positions [laughter] you know we as Travis to do a lot when we asked him to motor second base and I think it's he's played a little surveys but but probably you know pretty limited surveys uh since that time and and that way you can demoted his practice time and energy\nIt's you know really since uh since that that the trade so um it it's\nSometimes you you you know you make you make them more than you're not exactly sure how it's going to play out I'm In this case played out what are we you know we just your travels at second largely um non capitalistic third and and it's worked out well I think\nWe'll have more of a great girls would come and go before the end of the hour also how the brewers opportunity to play in the world series is a direct reflection of what I think it was
