clearly intentionally drag the leg and a hit ... lake which was just\nIt's just dumb there's no reason to do it it's just a bad dirty play from a guy who's creating a really really bad reputation right now side bar you know how much money is going to cost them and free agency\nZero he is not going to lose a penny a single penny in free agency by this anybody who thinks he's costs themself money by doing this stuff in the postseason I think you're naive it is going to cost him ...\nI hate to say that your after it all went down this is what he had to say about the situation and how he feels about many Machado\n... when he when he got laid off and everything is fine for forty five here for years okay\nSome of the ... of them that are they while he did mother [laughter] it's just the gang again and you know strong already done we've been really yeah everybody say in a hotel here of why was really mad but\nI'm just waiting for the winter day coming tomorrow I'm trying to win the horrors of videos activists just hit it didn't last night we were\nSo that's classic cases and you are right there as good of a dude as there is happy go lucky\nGuy who is friends with just about everybody treats everybody well he's not going to come into the clubhouse after the game and go scorched earth or Manny Machado that's just that's not his DNA and quite honestly\nNot that it would have made him look bad\nBut he would be less of a sympathetic figure in this situation when he's sitting there going me and many are good he apologized to me all good you're making too big of a deal of this come on it's just a game when he's going with that narrative\nYour man what a good guy like that they it just makes them more sympathetic like a just set however\nHis teammates had his back including Christian ...\nIs a fire that has a history\nThose types of is a one size max over and over and over again I understood very is there to play by thirty plays\nRespect someone for\nIt's a dirty play by a dirty player and some people kind of question what he's saying when he says I got respect from a ball player but he can't do that he said he respects his game\nLike he respects his ability to play baseball he respects the talent that is there that I I think I can speak for Christian yell edge on what he was saying there because some people said oh he's talking on both sides because now now he's saying\nHe doesn't respect many Machado but he respects the level of ballplayer\nThat is so that's yeah which by the way there was more stuff that he said after that that is not friendly for the airwaves I don't think anybody even caught it on on video but he was clearly not happy I Try to shock called it a dirty play a lot of people are calling a dirty play dirty player that was the narrative across then\nCrick counsel was asked about when he saw on that play\nI guess they they got tangled up at first his mind I don't [noise]\nI don't think he's playing all that [noise]\nThat's a that's a salad shot right there from ... council [noise] I don't think he was playing all that hard that's that\nThat Tim trying to go and do I say this do I say this yeah I'm just gonna I'm just going to say it I think the brewers handled it perfectly well now\nDo they need to reallocate reached retaliate to talk about that in our next segment I Want to be real clear on something\nAnd I'm not I'm not excusing many Machado I Am not excusing manning Machado if you've been listening to this from start to finish you've heard me say over and over and over dirty play no place in baseball that's my states\nBut for the folks out there I think he should've been objected who thinks he should have been suspended\nNotion enough he's showing of and I guess my point would be\nAnd maybe I'm wrong if if you've got something called for one for seven nine nine one six twenty and remind me but somebody give me an example of a situation like this where a guy gets thrown out of the gay players get thrown out of baseball games for two reasons throwing at hitters\nAnd then well three reasons throwing the hitters arguing with the umpire and then at times with the benches clear getting engaged in violent acts\nThat's it guys don't get adjusted for situations like these guys really don't get suspended for situations like the I I get to your righteously indignant about manning Machado being a little you know what I get that\nHe should have been suspended you shouldn't have been ejected it just there's no there's no track record for that in baseball as far as I can remember I Can't I Can't\nThink of a of a ... of a scenario that's analogous to what what happened right there with Machado or a guy got thrown out that's not something they around yeah you've got a situation that you can think of\nAnd clearly there is a track record and there was a precedent set previously in baseball for one for seven nine one six twenty it's acting that mortgage talking tech line personally I watch a lot of baseball I Can't remember one will continue to get it as much out of stuff and just a moment\nA and a will continue on of course I Do want to remind you\nPakistan's

Shaw Aguilar and yell at each Aguilar came like all these guys who I Would think it would be crazy\nTo pull those guys out of the line up\nThe only difference for me with Aguilar is he's a big dude\nAnd there's we saw it and the regular season there were just times that from a physical body standpoint he needed a day now we've got a day to day they did travel but today's off day I I think that's probably enough\nFor Aguilar to be on the line up tomorrow but if there's going to be one core member of the team who helped out maybe does not get in the lineup tomorrow to me it would be as your largest because he's got that track record in the season of needing the day here need your day they're probably a smart decision by the way for the brewers too\nI assume sleep in today in Los Angeles they just got back to Milwaukee like an hour and a half ago so but that's probably a three hour flight from uh LA to Milwaukee\nSo they were the sounds like they slept in and they were able to take this off days much as possible and it's I don't care how nice your plane is traveling tough\nYou can be on the nicest plane in the world there's just something about getting on a plane and it kind of wears you down a little bit so there was that aspect of it today for the brewers traveling is not easy but it's easier if you're in major league baseball and the fact that they were able to sleep and did they\nProbably helps out one more phone call before we get to a break we got dug in bearable hey Doug you're on WGM jak\nLiving that I call that an above swing oh that's good I liked that All right\nOh yeah you know I enjoy your explanation of the with the rhetoric second bailout versus on and then in the beginning that with the numbers that was really a\nVery very informative\nNow when you have a caller the other oh you're so you get a caller matters um ... and you went through the whole explanation of the hundred and sixty two games and the analytics versus the way\nThat you know that you know you can do it and she too is again after one week and then at the end you said well you don't want to take your job I was kind of thing and you were going to come up with some of the analogy\nThat at the end of that with with more information that I don't know what the caller was saying he pulled over them that explanation\nFor the call the other day basically said analytics does not work as well using analytics to make the to determine your decisions\nDoes not work as well in the postseason because it's a smaller sample size sort of friends you know a guy having a hot streak a guy in the cold streak can have a larger impact\nIn a post season series then over the course of a hundred and sixty two games I Do agree with that dog but I also don't think you need to go away from the number so you're right I don't\nI don't have this big like final answer to it I just think it's a really interesting thing to talk about\nOkay with that you are I think if he would have been injured I think there probably would have been a bigger finer situation with that and then uh you know I don't think it was a retaliation and it was just going to the latest it but I think well I I don't think I mean we did it um what show\nBut I don't I don't think that was a retaliation\nNo I don't think so either and I appreciate the phone call is going to get into that\nShow me a manager who retaliate set a guy in the postseason and also your manager who's not going to have a job for very much longer I how did he get his team into the post season in the first place like you just don't do it I guess\nI guess there could be a time or play syrup twelve nothing in the seventh inning or something then you say okay this is the chance but if you're playing type games in the postseason\nAnd you're going to pull this fake tough guy stuff thrown at somebody and yet when when Machado got hit the other day total coincidence one hundred percent without a doubt total coincidence there was nothing purposeful about that pitch that was a mistake pitch and that's all it was\nI don't know if I Want a baseball team\nTo win in the postseason then I don't want a baseball team retaliating against a Manny Machado kind of situation not the time not the place I'm not sure if you ever need to do it like we're moving towards a period in baseball where\nThe retaliation happened a little less often and I see text messages all the time from people saying oh correct council he's the wimp he's a\nWord that I Can't say on the radio I see all that stuff and it's given me a break\nYou throw in a guy more often than not you're being a fake tough guy\nGoing to baseball games go when a baseball game that's what I Want my team to do I'm not worried about oh manning Machado got 'em in the leg we got to do something\nIf they do something next year to them if he's still in the national league okay that's fine feel like you need to do it don't do it in the postseason\nDon't do it in the post season that's all I'm saying for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one sixth one of the accident mortgage talking tax on\nIt is brewers tonight

[laughter] so I mean if he if he would have got to hurt gotten hurt on one of those pictures I'm bringing ... wouldn't have already been working until you're like okay well this was a pretty plant thing\nAnd then you kind of figure out like okay this is this was the strategic mood a that was made to try to get a little bit more favorable wind up together for Brandon would refer to face\nAnd it also gives you wait my only now on full days rest\nAre on full rest going into his basically for us going into his shirt\nFriday and then that means ... can go on for rest on Saturday and so it starts to make some sense at that point\nI think it's genius because you bait yeah if the Dodgers put together a line up every day that goes righty lefty righty lefty righty lefty then there's no real advantage there because the Dodgers jak their line up against whoever the starting pitcher is what athletes a situation like why don't guy do this more often\nOh I think it was the or the moving forward maybe not as much in the regular season but of course and types of things we're seeing him or a platoon kind of split with their um anybody\nCurriculum for thought answered it laughing gas look they're working for the best match ups they yet and so early and so you try to do things and sometimes a little bit unorthodox sometimes maybe a little bit out of the box\nYou try to do things to manipulate the match ups or get the match if you want to go back\nLook I Know the brewers ... ... the move work a\n... ... the brewers in order because their initial outfitters retiree and brain Woodrow didn't do the job that they didn't win that game 'cause they didn't get anything going a quake Kirsch ... and you can't do a whole lot about that but the moon will\nFor the brewers now it might work better um\nWhich is the same company 'cause I thought about it or it could have had the raw not kind of\nHedged his bets a little bit with his line of and we still put max Muncie in there he didn't have ... Peterson in there so he had a little different lined up and maybe his typical\nGreat fill out you know for a right handed line up against the left handed pitcher [noise] um but it hey this is what I Love about baseball I I think\nSo much goes kind of out the window when the ... come and everybody manages a little bit differently and it just makes it kind of fun to watch and and really you all the wheels turning\nEven probably also argue may have worked a little bit better had there not been a Thirteen any game the day before because if if you don't use that much pitching the day before I think there's a exponentially less chance of wonder if it's given the opportunity to face the order of the third time through\nYeah probably so ... that's probably um\nAccurate I Would say um\nI think it also shows you're white or went longer yeah I mean some people thought he was going to go on Tuesday night because the brewers knew they were going to do this and we finally set up the game you know for a couple of days the wire and so um [noise]\nYou know all those things everything impact in a series of fighting series inner three game series and the regular season everything that happens the day before the impacts the next thing in some way and and I think sometimes we forget that forget about that we look at every game it's its own individual thing in that order is\nHowever when you're playing every day or in case of a ... a couple of days and that seven game series but when you're playing\nThat many games against one cream everything that happens tonight or so ago impacts you the next day I I think if you go back to ... who the brewer closed out game one but it was a little bit stressful hooking game one\nAnd that probably impacted the book and a little bit on gate to in game two because some some of the guys walking through more pictures and maybe the brewers would have liked for them to have had to have thrown in game\nIt all kind of get connected together one way or another\nClub lax to uh fly back today so they spent the night in Los Angeles just got back to Milwaukee a couple of hours ago so I assume it was a it was a kind of data sleeping and taking a little bit easy is that the way it went in terms of travel today\nYeah a slept slept in and\nUh everybody got up and got some breakfast and then kind of made their way to the boxes and fought that LA traffic LAX and then got on the plane and I think we're wheels up a little bit after noon Pacific time so yeah everybody was able to get a little bit of rats nobody had to rush or anything like that\nAnd to get into town at a decent time and\nYou see for their own bets tonight which I think at this juncture in the ear when even travel as much as these teams have then sleeping in your own bedroom is a is a really nice perk and so sweeping your own bed at night like them a little bit tomorrow morning it cut up and all that sleep it your clock styled Enright coming off the west coast and get ready\nFor what are your eyes lead them all night with white Miley against real\nClearly being down three do is not the situation you would like to be done but that being said and for being down three do for me particularly one loss away from your season ending\nI to me it seems like this is about the best arrangement of being down three to as possible you got to starting pitchers lined up you've done a great job\nOr your relief pitchers are pretty much rusted you didn't have to use a lot of your high leverage guys the most recent beg him rather game so I got at least two days rush for some guys I it seems like it does good of a situation as you can be in last there'll be down three Joe\nI totally agree I that was part of my message on my podcast today when\nThey look the brewers are down three too but they've done what they were supposed to do even though they had to steal a game on the road to do it they they've got the series back to Milwaukee and as long as they defend their home turf they're going to the world series and I think\nIt's easy to go gosh they're down three two they they've lost the last few games against the Dodgers and the other things are true but but they're not going to see Clinton crush again unless it's like some sort of a relief a Saturday and\nThey have now there you guys ready to go players they're\nGoing to have Josh hater ready to go for multiple innings over the course of the week and they're going to have Cory ... ready to go for multiple innings and I think you know your\nThey go for mope winning that I think you know you'll ... you'll feel kind of feel the game out on friday actually and see how they're going but if you can get through friday and you use all those guys you don't have to over them\nSaturday different Saturday's game seven it's trying to get to the world series or you're going over at that\nPoint and I I mean you could probably applied the same thing on friday but you know you got to win them both at that point you're I mean you got a lot of crazy thing\nYou might have Couric and they want her to a third heater for three and a third I mean I don't know it all depends on what you just seem to start things off but\nI'm game sevens are fun and games Seventeen get crazy and she's the one here in Milwaukee yeah\nYeah absolutely looking forward to it lane appreciate the time enjoy your evening and we'll see at the ballpark tomorrow\nI Can't wait we'll see their map\nI've very good there's lingering do joining us here on the brewers weekly\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine

important here and need to do damage um you know the middle of the older guys so that's you know that's that's obviously Ryan Braun and Aguilar and\nThen I get the home run of the first game um buddies he has been quiet sense and I think um [noise] you know what I mean those guys in the middle of the order of those are the guys that you're hoping that there's damage there and so you know I Would put\nBaggy in the same category as I'd put Christian and foot most is that uh you know guys that\nAre important for often are capable of the home run are capable of damage and um you know our guys that uh if we're going to win two games here are going to be in the middle of big often\nThey need to win the two games so from here on out in the national league championship series it is an elimination game tomorrow's an elimination game for the brewers not an elimination game for the Dodgers how describe council feel going into an elimination game\nYou know I I think for tomorrow it's it's a simple case of you know if you put everything out there that you have um you know we we've we've got our backs against the wall I think you you know it can be the last game of the season\nWe we really we haven't been in this game yet this year but we've been some some some games that were obviously you know a bunch of games that have been immensely important but we have not been in this game yet\nUm you know I Do think everybody realizes it's it's it's winter go home um and so you you're treated like that so it's it's a little different\nUm I I think it is a little different for everybody but I'm\nA you know it's you're given everything you've got and then you're given everything got and all these games but I think when you know it's it's winter go home at probably create um no I think it'll create a little excitement more so in our building I think it'll create a little excitement seven and a lot of fun and um and healthy and I think you'll see though\nI don't think the effort changes but you'll see the urgency\nYou know one thing that's going to be different tomorrow between the brewers and the Dodgers and I\nI think this is advantage brewers for game six but it turns into potentially advantage Dodgers for game seven\nTomorrow the Dodgers go through the game and Dave Roberts manages the game knowing worst case scenario he loses and they still play a game seven\nThe brewers incorrect council manage tomorrow's game knowing that if they don't when\nThey're done there is no game seven guaranteed for the brewers so\nGame seven be damned do what you gotta do to win games six worry about game seven when you're worried about game seven and I'm all you know ... very good at\nManaging the game with the the necessity to be prepared for the next game in the back of his mind I think he's probably scrap that tomorrow because this is that time where game seven is not guaranteed and he was asked about doing what you need to do to force that game seven\nYou know I I think when it's in this situation I think\nYou know you have to be willing to empty the tank and I think that's um and you know you know there's a game seven\nAnd I'm you know you know that uh you might not be all strength for game seven if you if you're forced to completely empty the tank but you got to get the game so so that's how will treat it and I think um you know get one sixty three is a little different because we we didn't know there was a that would have to be a wild card game the next day\nSo a lot of people are asking about the line or they're going to be any major changes while he was asked about what that game six lineup is going to look like\nYou know are lined up as as pretty as pretty determined and set up and I don't think we're as a there's a lot of different options to go with\nUm you know I'm confident in our guys I thought we did a nice job I guess for you with all the the first game he's he's been on a pretty good role to share but I thought we did a pretty good job so [noise] um you know more of the more the same as far as the next Thursday against a next time we face on tomorrow tomorrow night [noise]\nUm but it's just about it's about our guys getting a pitch to hit and then putting it but it's not going to change I'm In ... by any decision we make and from that regard\nSo at the lineup stays the same as it was against review the first time here's your line of for tomorrow Lorenzo Cain leading often centerfield\nChristian ... second in right field Ryan Braun Betty third left field he says that your body for the first base my ... third base ... six that second base aircrafts catching batting seven Orlando Garcia bad he ate at shortstop\nFor one for seven nine nine one one is the acting that mortgage talk ... will get into that line

to remember FDIC [noise]\nAnd the outcomes\n[noise]\n\n\nToday's cartridges moment I have an update for you on the Facebook data breach and\nWhat you need to know the Facebook data breach numbers have been all over the place the latest release for Facebook\nReduce now this is the reduced number of people whose information has been compromised in different ways on Facebook is now down to thirty million\nThat's progress because the last estimate was fifty million\nFor that tells you how difficult a forensic research is following a data breach as companies scramble and a data researchers security experts try to drill down into who's affected and how they're affected\nThe other part of this is not the good news the good news was the fifty to thirty the really bad news is what the crooks God is much more\nThorough than estimated before it's considered to be the worst breach ever\nOf the Facebook social media platform\nAnd the crux have a lot of stuff like they might have your contact information like your phone numbers\nAs they have for a many millions of people somewhere Fifteen twenty million they have information on your email address potentially what computers phones whatever you're reaching Facebook from\nA your gender\nWhat religion you around\nWhich people can figure out a number of different ways um they know what things you've been searching on on Facebook last physical locations you've been at\nDetailed profile information they did not get\nYour password at least at this time there's no information that they have your password or credit card information but one area where I Do urge real caution with Facebook is that you do in fact change\nWith Facebook where you no longer use Facebook as a way to sign in two other accounts you know how often you sign up with somebody in one of the options do offer you is to use Facebook as you're signing pretty too many eggs in one basket there and I don't want you to doing that anymore\nAnd when you do get involved with social media\nKnow that the information they're creates vulnerabilities to go much deeper\nThan you might imagine including potentially rating your money if you have it and whatever brokerage accounts investment accounts or bank accounts you have\nMakes all the difference in doesn't necessarily have to cost a lot more because in Andrew\nThere was an area where the entire neighborhood was flattened just like the pictures\nThat you may have seen from Mexico beach and there were some homes there were sitting there looking absolutely fine and those homes happened to be habitat homes\nThat were built with volunteer labor built way beyond what was the building code at the time and employed technologies that costs virtually nothing like a little thing assignments technology so little thing called the hurricane clip\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country and areas subject to tornadoes uh build with hurricane clips which helps support and reinforce the structure of a home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nAnd\nThe case in Florida we we live part time and a beach community and Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is its host out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall it's we're in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland that is an area subject to flooding and a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood flown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it just rethinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare\nFor the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount Soto incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat where property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happened to you have to rebuild again on and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf is with us on the Clark Howard show ... Ralph\nHello cart thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely how you doing\nI'm doing great Louis uh recently moved back for a living overseas for many years and he appreciated oldest sees that you have to say to make out of the integration little cheesy area because so many things have changed and very grateful for all your life you've given us so thanks for that\nOr give it a little back story where have you been living in for how long\nAre first released to the u._k. for about five years studying Switzerland for seven and put in Hong Kong for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now no kids so [laughter] how about you have any language is do you speak at this point [laughter]\nWell sleep fluently and to a little bit so\nFantastic [noise] they had a I speak English and Spanish to be able to find the bathroom [noise]\nWell see that's all you need you just need to be able to or the food and drink in line and then you could go\n[laughter] [laughter] um one thing I'm curious about after all those years away did you have a hard time reestablishing\nWhy did you have a hard time re establishing your credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that worry those areas difficult for you when you re integrated value in the U.S\nNo because we we had an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside Atlanta on a lake that we kept so we never from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people who are gone for a number of years but how can I be of service to you today\nWell the last thing that we want to do is we purchased the crow look and to do our banking and financial as you have a dies then I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account or the way that I can use social Jews and excess too old to get that going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer using chrome book for financial\nIt is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account with not integrate because you know with Gmail with the Google accounts\nWhen you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior wind or and so having that separate gee male\nIs the best idea you can do to protect yourself and protect what you do elsewhere how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial\n[noise] uh I don't know I live bullets from from my end or service to know\nWell happy anniversary I'm sure she spent very little money\nI'm sure she did that go she leads us to to of course a perfect\nSo with the ... the whole idea of a crime but where Raul and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available at a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nBuilt pay banking brokerage those kinda things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so chrome books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we got hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um\nInsurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers and having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out of here small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\n... thanks for taking my call\nSure Chris you got to a modern puzzle for me\n[noise] well yeah I saw a lot glad to hear that actually by a applied for\nA life insurance and they set up a net all his hand and ask all those all ... of course they take your eyes white blood pressure\nAnd they say take a blood sample and I'm like oh I Know that that blood samples to use for testing and I actually called a\nCalled your chain and or your team's fantastic by the way Oh thank you and\nHow they empty lot Clark Howard Eighteen but Howard said they call the state or insurance and I said I'm not a great idea so I gave them a call ... after a few departments or later I finally spoke with somebody in in the lady

about you ripping yourself off [noise]\nAnd coming up later [noise]\nI've got a new technique yet another one for you to use when you love to travel and you just want to know what deals there are so let's talk about you ripping yourself off\nThere's a new study that's been published by toy regard consulting outfit and they found that people doing four one K. loans\nDecimate your future financial security and retirement it's very common that employers will make it super easy for you to do alone from their four one K. plan\nAnd the philosophy of employers historically has been pay if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nWhen they're going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one K. loans\nBut the thing is when you do that those loans dramatically reduce how much money you have down the road when in fact you may find that\nYeah\nFour o'clock money so I Would tell you that having alternative payment forms\nIs going to be part of the future but they're not designed to be an investment they're designed to be a payment platform just another way to buy and sell things in somebody's promising ... you're getting in on the ground floor of a get rich quick thing\nI Would not get involved with anything like that they're they're ... you are eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if he can bring out of their faith land that's what my antenna\nUh and how much commission like if you got me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars for it if you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth of this this electronic Coyne how much do you get out of the commission\nI get a ten percent\nTo ... get Fifteen dollars and then whoever is paying this together gets a hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nAnd the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust and that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOK I Would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is\nThere's no true product or service is being sold if it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like\nThat could very dangerously ended up being an illegal pyramid\n\nAnd the only game of chance so unless you are somebody who really loves the whole idea of gambling do you love to gamble\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Do a little bit and go to Vegas taken a show enjoy all the glitz and the lights and all that but don't get involved in something that may well turn out to be an illegal pyramid Ponzi scheme and illegal game of chance and\nAh [noise] this whole thing with the virtual currency is a very nerve wracking thing for me this is the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\nFood

to pay for and was Scott's and next vacation you're sent email alerts when there's a special deal\nAnd the deals can be unreal Scott's had one recently that was a deal to Hong Kong from San Francisco\nFor four hundred and Eighteen dollars round trip\nThat's like nothing to go to Hong Kong that'd be like\nPaying Chicago to Miami paying twelve cents [laughter] if you think about the distance not quite that you get the idea and now there's another choice that's a worldwide one\nCalled secret flying dot com that at least at this point is free\nNot a newsletter service it's a website you can go to and see what deals there are at the moment like here's one and and these changed by the day deals to ah Europe deals to Central America\nA deal's within the United states\nAnd from various spots in the United states to others in the U.S feels or the Caribbean to Asia are really all over the place and so you just when you go to\nSecret find dot com when you get there you select that you're only interested in fares to party the United states or let's say a friend or family overseas and you want them to come visit you select whatever continent in the world they're from\nAnd you'll be able to see what deals there are from that continent to the United states\nSo this is just one other tool there is no one place to find all the deals out there but here's three sources if you're like me that the deal drives the destination\nIs with us on the Clark Howard show hello ed\nYes good afternoon clerk that we want to talk about transportation\nIt's going to afternoon clerk that we want to talk about transportation what are you thinking of doing\nYes we do okay my wife and I are retired couple here relieving ... live in a central Florida\nAnd we've been on a few crew is is that now that we're retired down here in Florida when we find going on a cruise but also uh\nWe'd like to uh find out what sites are available for people that live down here because we're retired we can go on short notice a few days notice if there are are good deals\nThat you can get on a last minute a cruise is definitely\nOkay so there there are some in particular that people who have that flexibility use and one that's very popular with people who do that is one called cruise credit\nAnd when you get to the main page there's a deal section and the most popular part of the deal section is last minute cruises and it's a cruise lines can dump their unsold inventory on ships at the very last minute\nAnd you'll find\nThat if you can be opportunistic like that and fire crews at the very last instant that that's a great way for you to do it also have you ever been to the website cruise compete dot com\nHabits so crews compete you can put what you're interested in doing and cruise only agencies and literally compete for your business\nAnd sell any of them so they may be willing to give up some of their commissions um you know in order to be able to sell you at a lower price\nOkay that sounds pretty you know you talk like last minute you're set on the website there are they talking a few days or like a\nGenerally with the ... last minute is less than three weeks before sailing\nOr less ... less than three weeks\nAs you think most people that are buying a cruise they're not like you they're not living gosh if you're in central Florida\nYou're fifty minutes or so from Port Canaveral which I think is the biggest us crews sport now there's a lot of ships sail out of Tampa that are like probably Ninety minutes from you and people in South Florida Miami for Lauderdale\nAcross the Everglades in Naples Marco Island they do these last minute deals and so it's very common practice for Floridians to do these last minute bookings 'cause you don't need air but most people\nAre living who knows where in the United states or even in Canada or overseas or whatever and they gotta make advanced plans to once you cross that Twenty one day period bats when you see so many of the deals\nOkay very good and the most of the large cruise lines they'll participate or\nNot necessarily it varies I'm looking right now on what's available on the thing I was talking about they're showing a lot of cruises that are just in the next couple of days\nThat there are real deals on those that are about yeah about three weeks out to their great deals on and they show you how much a percent discount there at but I don't ever believed discount\nFrom a cruise line I only care about what the prices and comparing the price\nFrom one vendor to another\nOkay very

I Can't place my finger on either but you can go buy\nA one of these phones from a Chinese seller haven't shipped all the way over here and buy it for at least a third less than it cost if you buy it from an American retailer that cells that Chinese branded phone\nBells that Chinese branded phone\nIn retail store on line\nSo it will hold on my after the Asian\nGuy I Can't compete with what's going on from China generation you know I Can't compete\nBut but the thing is it's not sustainable it's not sustainable and it's not going to last so people want to sell us good below their cost I Know that's called\nDumping but I Am in favor of dumping because if they want to lose money to support us let him go for it but I'd much rather lob cellphone cases at a loss at us and set a nuclear tipped missile any day you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nYou'll see one or earnings go up we are and\nThe rents generally on the apartments that you're looking at are in the range of twelve hundred they might listed at a thousand\nYou know like maybe Fifteen twenty percent below prevailing rats and\nSo it'll be these are nice pictures of a place and all that and remember it's a it's what's known as a stolen or hijacked listing most often called the hijackers thing where they are post pictures they may have taken off of a\nA condo listening site may have been off of Zillow whatever and they just take those pictures of a place typically a condo for sale\nMore often than a rental unit for rent\nAnd they'll duplicate the pictures do of listening is if it's a rental habit available unfortunately most often on Craig's list\nAnd\nFor whatever reason they can't show you the place but they're happy to rent it to you as long as you fill out the rental application all that and they go through the whole protocol just like you would with any other place and the whole gimmick is just try to get a security deposit out of you and first month's rent\nSo what you need to know particularly if you're moving into an area from out of town or even if your local you don't want to rent a place sight unseen pictures on the Internet not enough\nYou want to actually see the physical place now the crux are gonna vanish\nWhen they know you want to see the actual rental property and that's the greatest protection you can have\nMagnet is with us on the Clark Howard show how are you I'm perfect great how can I serve you well\nUm I haven't been having is they add birthday next year and I was wondering if there is any way I could there every search for ... Antarctica I could afford on our librarian budget here that they can they are so I just wanted to surprise him but from life\nWell are you just the sweetest you're not going to go now\nOkay so I have not Antarctica is the only continent I haven't gone to\nAnd normally you think it's because I haven't gone because I'm cheap and I won't spend the money that's half the answer the other half is if you watch any videos on YouTube about what the waves are like\nIs you go south most people go south from Argentina the waves are dry a monster waves most of the time limit columns as you get closer to Antarctica and so do you think your husband could handle going through her\nWe rent a lot by God and I understand the way there were other unpleasant that as well\nOkay so good for him I'm not doing that though that's not me out for like two days and I woke up and I had no one had been through him so the reality is going to Antarctica is going to be an expensive venture\nMhm and there are no\nTrue bargains trips that I have ever heard of to in order to something that has to be a very very special event that's worth laying out some serious cash\nThat's not the answer you were looking for for me was that\nWell I was just wondering maybe have faith in the air or if they are and their life and it shows\nHow case it will go to Antarctica ... to get there from there\nYou go to Antarctica during the um north northern hemisphere winter\nMhm because it will be summer so you really want to go in um December January February\nAnd Antarctica is I'm a generally you go on a boat and uh there used to be um like discovery fights that people would go on where you just fly down\nAnd you'd fly over the uh Antarctica and then you fly back and it's\nThat something that I'm not aware is done any more because it just doesn't give you the experience you have\nIf you go by boat many of the boats that go are for scientific research but there are journeys for people who just want to experience the adventure\nAnd I'm trying to think where you know what okay\nKrista my producer just came up with something on the Web that did not occur to me you're going to like this where she just came up with\nThere are a when they have ... sold burst on the cruises to Antarctica they offer deals on them just like they do for any other crews for last minute unsold cabins\nWow I Would have never thought of that that's why she's my boss she got that brain power that so that is the right thing to do is to look for the last minute cruise what Monti you thinking of him going\nLike football I hate going to go he can go any any any time next year\nOkay whatever so is what I what I Would do is I I Would I Would I talk to someone who is a cruise only agent and\nGet it he or she to to keep monitoring it and when there's a real special for one opens up particularly for a last minute but that's how you bucket and that's how he goes back\nAnd you have to add in the cost is most of them as I mentioned go from Argentina huh so you have to add in the cost of the flight\nFrom wherever in the U.S to Argentina not to Buenos Aires to uh to [noise]\nI don't probably frequent flyer miles that's why they did find that there have been allowed back off\nVery smart very smart that combination my there would be a great deal use a free ticket and then a last minute crews and he will ever experienced the only continent I have not been too and maybe I Need to stop being such a wimp\nRobert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nHey good to fill that out here today was great to have you here\nYou are last year for me about it how I get a raise or the last oh All right [laughter]\nYou mentioned the blade well I Can't figure out how to do that\nWell I don't have you with the writer\nRobert what you're supposed to do is you are supposed to use like um\nAlcohol to dry it or some people that are obsessed use of blow dryer there are now devices you can buy at drug stores that when you're done shaving you put the blade into it and then it's basically an internal hair dryer kind of thing\nThat ... that drives the blade I simply a dry it on my child shake it off dry it on my child put it in the drawer and two plates ago my blade lasted Fifteen months\nMy most recent blade I Am sad to report only lasted three months\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI don't know what I read the wrong because that's the shortest any blade has lasted me in years and years and years but it only got three months out of it\n[noise] but let's do for the impression that I liked that alcohol I Do think I'll do it that way [noise]\nSo how often do you replace it played Robert\nWill only have about a ... a week and I can get probably go a month old who played for\nNow if you started drying it you'll make it dies twice a week shaver you might make it two years\nWe will see a lot of it I'm going to think of the challenge\nAnd going to think of the challenge\nAll right let's see the longest 'cause I was impressed with my Fifteen months but there are people have gone way past Fifteen getting is a a raise or the last ... the key is the blades don't deteriorate from the active shaving\nThey deteriorate only from moisture the manufacturers chicken Gillette\nAnd the other smaller players make fantastic razors now\nAnd there's no reason for him to degrade and never particularly ladies don't

I have all Mr ... take its worst my library how by this book without at a rest area fully strapped for him as ... as advisor I'm a ... hour\nDisagree strong it was ... it has premise\nThat we should intervene abroad in various places specifically at least\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official and unofficial as the um I just disagree with his privacy ... Iraq War was justified whether we should be at after I started at all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years we've got changed it are they any of the country\nYou're thoughts police are\nWell I mean we have not been effective in Afghanistan you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked so there\nAre I think we would have been done better if we had taken a kind of out from Afghanistan before they had an opportunity to attack us which some that we bought a at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I Know I'm not going to go back\nAnd say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I still have a hard time believing it would be better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we kept now at the lower it up carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr ... what about what we should do but the real question seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way and uh unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOr one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the governments of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart with U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money is not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have it in many cases is thinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick\nA particularly the second the Iraq War the notion of being that that will go in will pull up the uh\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rushed to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen let us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says ah you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything that we should be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWell six six five oh Jim Boehm when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls him from east Texas fellow Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know you it's like I'm I'm working on a piece us right now is a historian at the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered that new world there was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that mapped the world and that brought marketing pillows and and commercialism around the world that we're going to math or they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us to\nThe point that we are today and I feel is inevitable and America seems to be the uh the chosen vehicles or the ...\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know a collective is notions and that's\nThat's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nI I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are going in and and I really do they they depend on human actions but there's no question that the caller's right to say that you know the United states found itself in a particular position\nHuman actions but there's no question that the caller's right to say that you know the United states found itself in a particular position or that do other country was in and I some of it has to do with geography you know we talked about\n... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually Gulf us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect an international economy the way the benefit of the road so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there is an arc of history I guess for me but\nUh certainly United States has to shape history with it with him as well\nAnd then of course it is if this if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet another position to be able to\nUh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available uh uh to be heard not only on our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and bus gill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight pillow gill\n[noise] here's Jim I'm just one comment on your shirt views on your show dreams like Korea and Japan has\nUm create a arrangements are with the United states and under certain conditions we could re a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict with users or Korea or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize that not that many years ago this was United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say no true just exactly how many countries out there or are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters white taken\n[noise] All right let's let our guests commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict to Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter\nChina from attacking them whereas if we hold back in ... and those kinds of Tibet business\nWe will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think get thrown in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain eat and not have to get into\nWar is if we think we could stay out of the conflict that involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered a twice over the last half century we can't stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd if we try to do so uh uh we we tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor or in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about all offshore balance ours but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties the consequences of that was a spy on shore so I think it's better to ... the security arrangements\nStay with us or more to come but one eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman senior fellow\nWith the project on international order and strategy at the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution online at Brookings dot edu is a columnist for the Washington Post author of the return of history at the end of dreams\nAre dangerous nation of paradise in power and they twilight struggle you served in the state department and the deputy for policy in the bureau of American Affairs or graduate of Yale and Harvard University's Kennedy School\nBullet we we certainly are having a high level of of of conflict and disagreement but if you think about what\nA lead to the civil war it was a very specific set of circumstances a it was a first of all you have the country divided geographically you had a southern part of the country that at that had an institution of slavery that the north\nOpposed and didn't have and you had a meat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said you know in a way it's precisely because there is such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually you know the divisions we have today they're like\nNeighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagreement people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had between a slave holding south and a capitalist north so\nI think we're we're obviously in great disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstance\nI certainly am happy to hear you say that and I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct heroin me build Pennsylvania now I Believe and Carol\nYou say that it and you need to keep\nThat radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call\n[noise]\nI don't want to say much all I wanted to say as I Am against the United states doing any first ... well\nOkay I'm not sure that uh that we have any confidence plated or as a matter of ah\nOf ah your thought process Robert Kagan a I guess we would have to define a further first strike I doubt that were of a mind to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option\nAlthough my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which have proactively or engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the beneficial [noise]\nYeah I mean we certainly I uh we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in a first strike that stuff's not in our policy in it and it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis developing\nA that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do it as intelligent live selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's\nTalking about yeah yeah they they get into the the key is in the term of first strike\nA more to come one eight six six five oh Jim bowl what should be the American role in the world regardless of what we

playoff game and a lot of ways and that's how they get ... that's how they started approaching the pitching and it was the regular season when they started pulling guy after four innings and things of that nature in\nThe month of September because they have those expanded rosters at that point in time show it seems to me and pleading high stakes high intensity baseball for a long time um this is the first time\nWhere the seasons kind of on the line and so that's a little bit different here tonight but I suspect that same kind of performance from this team they pitch it\nExtremely well in this race and Haley going clear back into September with the way I mean really all year long but I mean I think they taking it to another level with what they've been able to do over the last\nFour or five weeks going back into the regular season it's been really fun to watch and I think you're going to see the same thing that I mean look you got to wait on he's pretty much on for us which is a big deal

dried out the parking lots are there was some rain when I came to Miller Park earlier the sun's been peeking out occasionally\nAnd we can put up with the wind looks like a pretty good day for tail getting as we get separate games six and seven\nAt Miller Park this weekend as the brewers try to do something they haven't done in a long time get back to the world series I Know that the communities

bill to catch it at a at a later time so Brian style Randy Bryce will be going head to head\nAnd I think when you when you look at that or it's a mismatch\nI heard something I heard I read some social media conversation last night where people stay in people that were uninformed or not folks that live here but just people on social media in general the boiler hoping Randy Bryce would win and then somebody interjected the fact well what about the arrests and then the response of social media was water rafts\nAnd I'm thinking that's how much you invested in this race you you're backing something that you don't know what the history of the fact that he's been arrested nine times for a variety of things\nThat's about as easy as it gets for a voter you know and they're already conservative district like the first congressional my district running from Janesville all away and the Oak Creek\nPretty easy choice so that's one of the debates tonight let me get Baldwin invoke fear and I see

season is a fun fun night\nI think both candidates are looking to find their footing on this and that and what's really difficult if I don't\nI don't know if we're not really having an adult conversation really about what it takes two to cover a pre existing conditions and what the AC a did and what the Republican plan that didn't quite happen Congress would have done\nWhat ... what they need to do is is is be forthright and honest I Know they both say they want to protect a people with preexisting conditions they got to add a little bit more half of them that they can't just say it\nAnd I think they have to get they have to find some footing on what were the details of that Republican plan what were the details ah that would have protected people with preexisting conditions while lowering premiums while reforming health care I I think they they have a problem here and that's what they really need to solve here in the last three weeks\nDo you think that health care is the is the number one issue with Wisconsin voters as we have to November\nYou know that it's really interesting because I Would not have predicted this but if you look at if you look at polls and you look at a uh where people rank issues healthcare is continuing Lee at the top and what we've seen is that if passed jobs in the economy is something that Republicans\nAre both Walker and ... mirror she's touting the Trump agenda or the Ryan agenda they have a lot to talk about they have a lot to be proud of\n'em but it's it's again it's one of those things that um they're not they're not talking about jobs right now they're not talking about\nUh the low unemployment rate they're not talking about um um the tax bill the tax bill was supposed to be this huge winter for Republicans and you don't hear Republicans talking about it so\nThey're clearly worried about this pre existing condition thing they're hearing about health care and they have to find their footing on it and they have to make a strong argument that's what I'm saying they they they they have to find their footing here and I I'm very concerned that this is a live issue for them\nIt's almost like the classic what if they gave a debate and no one came to so much attention on the Milwaukee Brewers that I don't know the folks are actually going to be paying attention to anything that any of the candidates tonight including even in the first congressional district anything they say other than those folks who still read the newspaper\n[noise] right ... these debates have come to it seems in recent years they're all get buried on Friday nights and I don't know if that's an attempt by the campaigns to if there is a poor performance that they don't want anyone to know about it and they think the risk is higher than the reward which I think is is deeply unfortunate\nUh you're right that the brewers are are rightfully in my opinion uh have have the state and\nAnd everyone's engaged on that um but\nWhat matters is kind of the spin what matters is is what ads come out of this debate what attack lines come out of this debate is\nIt'll evoke mirror Scott Walker you know do they have a soundbite that answers the preexisting condition question to answer these health care questions that are that how are the importance of the of the good economy right now and ... and and as well for Democrats Uber's involved when do they have something that they can come out of this work with\nThat's what that's what will be interesting is what's the story what the headline tomorrow\nCounter off in the Wisconsin to Vermont liberties

going on\nThe brewers are sucking all the oxygen out of the uh the media and the consumers of media this week and then hopefully next week and beyond\nBut I think I don't think folks are are going to pay much attention to the debates tonight I don't think they're going to take away anything from or or or be impacted by what this ... plagiarism story is about\nAnd I think when you look at the national stopping them and ask about that in the second when he gets back on the line what Donald Trump's doing Donald Trump's essentially doing what he did and twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen he's going around the country making campaign speeches\nPlaying to his base and to a riled them up he thinks to get people to vote counts back on the line got your back here calling yup I'm back All right so let's shift to the national stuff I was I spend a little a little time there were getting reconnected\nDonald Trump is going around the country doing campaign style rally is he's he's always done that as president put these ramping it up in the lead up to November So two things one\nWill work will incite the Republicans and to have the opposite effect and and get more Democrats out to the polls\nWell with any Trump rally or or the more they're more Trump there is I think that there's something of a risk reward right so every one of these rallies is is covered very heavily or his language and what he chooses to talk about particularly stuff off the cuff is always a a talked about something that\nAnd it's helpful and in teaching children to critically thinking understand and\nAnd and engage other people with with disagreeable viewpoints uh I I think the whole thing is deeply unfortunate and I agree with you a lack of leadership in terms of there there have to have been a million ways out of this dilemma that didn't involve cancelling it and giving into the hecklers veto\nThroughout just back and forth I mean if you're going to make a decision to make a decision but they you know the chancellor brought it back then we're going to one production ... it's really demonstrates clearly\nAnd soundly lack of leadership from that from that school district do you think the Pendleton the pendulum is still swinging in the direction of the censorship of historical pieces of of work that are really tell the story of our country or is or is this is going to come back the other direction where do you think that stance\nI actually don't you know there there's a big new study on on political types that have come out that's called the hidden tried and one of the big things that come out of this that and I think it's a great and useful term it's called the exhausted majority that\nThat and this exhaustive majority is is is fed up with political correctness that can't stand that eighty percent of the things off the majority don't like political correctness\nAnd yet so many of our debates are driven by the extremes um I I I actually think this political correctness and this kind of silliness doesn't permeate beyond just a handful of very noisy people\nAnd it'd be nice to see once in a while as superintendent or a principal or other members of business community or this that or the other thing show some leadership show some common sense and stick up for what they know a is obviously right and the circumstances and it's just unfortunate that

his opening day in Milwaukee April second group coming home after beginning the regular season with the sleep apnea yang out\nAre saying this spring brewers opening day is here and double duty and Jay is Doug Russell is live at Miller Park believe it or not this is the aid to opening day here at Miller Park meaning there's a whole generation of fans that never had to break the elements for baseball

agency\nIn two thousand nine tabulation out there twenty six year run a no postseason baseball at all the guy who carry them on his back she sees a bath\nLike field are gone to another team in a big

uh and how that ended in how disappointed we were but you know when we have an opportunity to seize the day\nAnd I think for a lot of a U.S brewers fans\nIt's all wrapped into that storyline that George Web piece the you know the fact that we are at Miller Park when I'm looking at a semi right Miller Park to my left the Miller sign up there a facility here in Milwaukee that great connection between fans and team\nWhat do they always say about the brewers team great family atmosphere veteran leadership the Ryan Braun to craft says\nFor the younger players Christian yell it's more than likely to be the MVP of the national league somebody great story lines\nSo after the break I'm gonna ask you this question for one for seven nine nine one six twenty what's your favorite game or story line of twenty Eighteen what ... what stood out to you what was the turning points what was a moment you said you know this team has something there's a there's a\nA spark or a a a difference maker that I didn't expect I think all of us that watch the team last year twenty Seventeen expected them to be good\nBecause it got so close one game in the playoffs last year I don't know that a lot of

do think the left hander as um match up while against them [noise] um you know really that I think they're just trying to split up the you know are right and left in ... and make it as tough as we can on their boat and they're both ends [noise]\nDone a really nice job and we've had trouble putting rallies together against their bullpen I'm so we'll we'll try to negative stuff as we can against them ah hopefully it's you know we've scores of runs early but um you know make it harder and they were just trying to make it was hard on them as we can\nCrank to follow up on that one of these teams from ... in the second half his power numbers have dropped off even that pitcher pitching him differently or it's what do you think has come from\n[noise] it's more than anything it's just the ... every season for these guys is different I think Aggie had a you know absolutely amazing first happened\nYou know he he he came a you know and then the second half as his numbers declined a little bit [noise] you know the pace he was on was kind of out of this world\nAnd then there's ... there's adjustments made of course I'm\nYou know that they've made adjustments to him and he's um\n[noise] you know now has the the you know he was an all star he has the respect of the other team and the certainly the attention of the other team now as a as he goes into the second half so [noise]\nUm you know he's still capable a lot and I think um you know I'm I'm Still expecting a lot and he's going to be an important player in the next two games for us\nCraig knowing what types tonight how do you keep nerves from check for a game like that\n[noise]\nWell I mean I think are crowds a huge part of this game tonight I'm you know I mean one of the things that we've been we've had to travel I thought we had trouble doing at Dodger Stadium is that we just didn't you know we were unable to pull a lot of pressure on\nThem you know on their pitching and um\nYou know hopefully that something that the crowd can help with um\nYou know as we get rallies go on that we can that that can add to the pressure of [noise] um so I think if anything you know the home crowd I think\nDoesn't make you more nervous it helps you out it helps you out and hopefully I'm you know your that's what a home crowds for is to help you out a little bit like the\nCurriculum because we have to win two games um can you share with us anything of the philosophy of Joe least today are you going to send them out to the pen at the start of the game we could be bigger in this game really early if you needed or will it be like a in case of emergency type of thing late in the game [noise]\nYeah I I think look\nI think you have to have every every player available today\nUm that's that's that's rested I'm unable to pitch in a new lease is certainly able to pitch so he [noise] you have to factor in in um\nYou know and so where that is I think there's other guys that arrested as well um you know ... there is a game tomorrow in and that matters um\nWe do have some other other guys arrested but but you if you least needs to factor in the game than health factor in the game\nIf you were intending this game as your old self as a kid from whitefish bay high school and not as the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers how to greet many Machado today\n[laughter]\nUm\nYeah I mean I Would uh cheer for my own team yeah [noise]\nYeah\nYeah I mean some I'm I I'm guessing some other people won't take that view um but I watched a cheer from my own guys yeah\nThat's a good question [laughter]\nThat's a good question ... you're in this game in two thousand loving game six women Asian game in the house yes what do you tell your players today as a manager for that same game you're young you're young players\n[noise]\nWe're we're ready for the game I say look at it doesn't I don't think it changes um your mindset changes you know you're in the NFL cs and and so for for whatever game here and it doesn't change um [noise]\nIf you get that guy over perhaps it instead of the strike out you were able to get the player in undergrad or some ... um you know just getting a runner over can be critical\nGame like tonight where you have nowhere else to go where it's winter go home so\nWe haven't seen much of it this season and I hesitate to say yes tonight as the nights that you'll see it would have to run scoring environment proves to be\nChallenging for the brewers and it really has been for the bulk of the series\nGive it a given situation would be very interested to see how this plays out tonight with two left he's on the mound hundred where you add weight Miley and we'll see what the second pitcher is in for quake council tonight everybody is fresh I think everybody except

from now you'll have first pitch seven thirty nine the exact time\nA reminder tomorrow's game if you're looking at an old schedule probably says the rivers and Dodgers should they play a game seven where we played at eight or nine they have moved to the star titled that gave the seven or nine so be aware of that\nIf you're making plans to be out here tomorrow evening seven died starred as the brewers have Dodgers would be the only game played tomorrow and uh the pastor was in Red Sox have completed their series with the red Sox will be gone so\nIt's just like that you could be off the Boston here before the weekend and if you're the Milwaukee Brewers and wouldn't that be something here to be in the world series for the first time since Nineteen eighty two\nFor one for seven nine one six twenties the accident mortgage talking tax wind up feeling can scheduled to meet with the media here in just a few moments I Do want to depend on that is just you know you're part of where we're sitting here at Miller Park where if you're driving to the stadiums here in the parking lots of\nYou know a lot of where the brewers are today can be owed to bug feeling in his ownership of this team Miller Park but still it deserves a lot of credit for keeping the brewers in Milwaukee\nWith the stadium so absolutely as he was commissioner of baseball for so many years I mean more than Twenty years serving in the head of the the major league baseball did a lot of great things in baseball and uh ultimately kept the brewers in Milwaukee so a lot of credit and I'm sure but it gets very pleased to see his brewers\nPlaying at this stage of the season you back in the nineties it before revenue sharing this was not going to happen stuff like this\nYou know you had the big market Yankees he had some of the larger markets around baseball\nPopulating the playoffs prior to the wild card it was really the have and have nots and all the baseball\nThe other raised kind of broke the mold several years ago breaking through with a a payroll about forty four million dollars the royals the second smallest marketing all major league baseball winning the world series a few years back I mean that kind of stuff just would not have happened during the time where revenues were not share you know but feeling is\nIs that the forefront of that never thought it would work the big market owners hated the idea I thought it was awful why should I give any other team my money\nIt was agreed happy society in major league baseball but ultimately it got through became part of the collective bargaining agreement that revenue sharing is a big deal the big reason why the brewers and any small market team\nWas able to get to the point where they're playing into the playoffs you Lisa scene is scheduled to start tomorrow but available tonight according to cry count so who's going to get the ball the weight Miley\nAnd I do expect a ... a corps of boos for manning Machado what do you take the field I thought that was maybe the most interesting question asked Craig council during his pre game briefing\nYou know if you were a fan here what what was your reaction to Matty Machado be\nPretty good answer bike ride council after giving it some thought that he would just you know go ahead and root for his team the brewers and not worry about the other guy\nUh but I Would imagine that ... that it will be viewed as a bit of a villain tonight here at Miller Park I Would imagine he get an earful of it every time he steps into the batter's box every time he makes a play anytime anything happens involving many Machado I Would expect the crowd here at Miller Park to give it to have saluted\nPerhaps even on WGM Jay walking to the program Steve\nYeah it was gonna say a couple of things that that gives me some hope here with the brewers I Hope I I feel pretty confident um a couple of things you know okay\nFive games were down treated too it'd be nice were treated to up\nBut you know we've got two games back in Milwaukee I mean realistically yeah I Would have been nice to win the first to him but I mean we knew we weren't going to probably get two or three years wait I'm In LA\nUm another thing I'd say it um I mean I'm hoping we did this without the top of our order fattening during good Braun was pretty good you know but [noise] matching if these guys come out of their slump now they may they may not but I mean I could see\nBlasting the ball all over if we could get out of this I mean yell at ... I Love the guy and I don't blame him for a thing but imagine if he a notch all relative to tonight and um the next next game I mean you know what do you they\nMight just looking for any kind of sustained rallies here right to to to try and get a cricket number on the board it's been you know a run here at a run there and to run here and it's been really minimal seems like all the opportunities the brewers have had for a rally\nCome with guys on base it in one out that all of a sudden get a strike out and then maybe get something that affords one run to score but\nYou walk away feeling like boy that was a missed opportunity yeah I think back to the uh one of the things the brewers scored an original came double against Clinton herself or that looked like it could have been such a great ending for the brewers and that's part of it as Clinton curse all\nThe other part is just the the brewers inability to string together a number of hits him you know it was hurt them it really has I mean they they're pitching ... without allowing a run", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "19"}
