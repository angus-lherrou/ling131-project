Detroit to\n'em and making sure that uh you know I was just walked in for each opportunity and and now I really didn't get ahead of myself that I just had a really good patient from tempo with a with every character and I'm obviously twenty nine yard or just a just end up trucks that everything and knock the bird so I\nFelt I felt really solid with every attempt tonight and uh I was just happy really happy with our or how I work this week in the eye and overcame them very very difficult week last year last week\nIt was just kind of have the sense that if you could just get one kid true that you know you talk about flushing what happened last weekend's Detroit that you could truly just put what happened last week behind you\nObviously getting on the field you know the most important thing so I had a lot of opportunities the night yeah just every time I just had a calming or you know just felt very calm very balanced focused in on every every never cared so um yeah there was a it was something special obviously\nAnd the the focus of the work and put it in this way to make sure that it was because they have a game like the one\nAfter the performance last week in Detroit did you change on your approach it all this we did you change anything about the way that you approach or the week in preparation for the forty niners\nAre nothing you know that that was my biggest thing was bigger than a over analyze our valley way try to try to mess with too much you know I felt really good this whole year um you know\nYeah that that Detroit game um you know was was unacceptable it was something that uh that I never envisioned ever happening in my career and now I I I almost took it as that just are just kind of move forward and make sure that\nThey're moving moving on here the fees and I'm I'm focusing on each week every game as if it's a it's a playoff game and it's a it's kind of do or die in a I'm I'm making sure that\nIn my mind set is that and I'm just picking each opportunity so if anything that was a was a kind of the only only change was a really you know holding in that focus made sure that a\nA walk them for for each and every attempt that are that I get to you to have\nYou been with this franchise for a while now two thousand seven or was your rookie year so I mean you you you've been through the highs and lows with this franchise ended his team here at

they got it opening drive in fact the opening play Rogers to mark ... gambling for sixty yards and enter the backers up with good field position Rogers to Montgomery there was actually a a lateral so uh technically a touchdown run by a Montgomery good for two yards that tied at seven and\nWell it was back and forth and it was a down to the wire but thirty three to thirty the Packers gives a win over the forty niners welcome back the Packers oh deep I Am ... for one for seven Ninety nine one six twenty of them are called the ... for one for\nSeven nine nine one six twenty back to the phones to tone is in Green Bay Packers okay\nJoe thanks for a\nWedding in God's will be quick\nWas that the guy that went on for Jamie ... on our side Francisco like Green Bay was to watch I'm sure but very good at all and the one thing I Would add about Aaron Rodgers as it gets rid of all before you get ill\nHolding the way you should not be only on all the money to the game\nWhich were happening on the game now hang up every\nHi Tom uh thanks for the call you know we talk about this last week I mean the thing about Aaron Rodgers is the very thing that makes them great is you know the the ability to extend places you know also the thing that\nPeople are going to be critical about when when the often doesn't work either he holds on to the ball too long and you know wait too long for receivers you get up and sometimes it doesn't just shut down or just throw the ball away and and live to fight another day\nUm I think very close to the top of the list of why the Packers had been struggling um throughout the season is is that it's just a different Aaron Rodgers um you know he has not been as accurate\nAs we've seen in the past to be even here tonight I'm you know he missed on some throws 'em and I think some of his decision making also is not going to sharp but as it has been but you know when when he makes a big gross\nWhether it was a ride on the first Dr or on the last drive as well um he's still got it you know now here's some interesting numbers and you know when when you talk about\nWhere this team is um because all through the week you're talking about this team has been sloppy they've been shooting themselves in the for them and making a lot of mistakes penalties big issue or against Detroit last week and six penalties for fifty five yards tonight so not really egregious\nHolding on to the football talked about that ball security very important All right you know you can get a couple of takeaways from San Francisco but feel goals uh instead of touchdowns red zone often ... and ... down off and this is where you got into trouble\nThe Packers tonight for Thirteen a big part of it do back in ... and look at how many sort of long situations they got themselves into and you know even if you have the best quarterback in the game you can't constantly put yourself behind the eight ball like that\nYou you have to set yourself up for success and a lot of that is winning on first and second Dallas obviously something the Packers and not been doing and I just and I uh but throughout um so far this young season so\nYou know there there's a lot of work to do what you look around at the end of the north and you know obviously Chicago last yesterday Minnesota gotta win I mean there are three to him on Chicago's three into\nYou know I was about half the teams the NFL I Know I don't know what to make them and the Packers are right there and ... defense\nYou know despite the fact that they gave up thirty one points against Detroit last week that was not the big liability here tonight defensive were being honest with the liability and um you you had I known again there's a lot of speed on San Francisco often spoke with the way that CJ bastard looked so comfortable\nOr go into football that is definitely a problem let's get back out it would have been in lacrosse Evan you're on Packer so take\nThat example of what I call it what am I thought were about to run again like they were running the ball really early on us and I was wondering what you thought about and what ... the maker so yeah that's about it\nAll right ... thanks for the phone call or that disappointing I mean I I don't see how you can say otherwise ... came into the game a little bit banged up last week\nI'm left to the game against the cardinals and the first quarter and you know ended up sixty one yard John fourteen carries a ... eighty seven yards on twelve carries and there were a lot of big chunk place in running the football and getting to the outside\nUm some of that speed was definitely on display I don't think there's any question um the strength through this Packers defense has been that defense of wind but you know you can get to the outside\nUm I the forty niners show that they were they were able to expose the Packers run defense in you know look\nWe've talked so much about how difficult the schedule is going to be on the other side of the by weekend I I don't think you can discount where you've got the rams and you've got the patriots and back to back we backed a back road games\nAnd we don't have the quarterbacks are but you know it's all about how successful do two teams are running the football um so yeah I there's no question it's a problem at all or you got to like the fact that they got the wind here tonight I mean they do what they had to do with truth be told\nThis is the San Francisco team that has one when they could very well be when was this year and you haven't even really faced the meat of the schedule yet either the first two two games of the seasons division of opponents are always big but\nUm you have not really faced a high flying off it isn't and you're going to see that are coming up here on the other side of the ... on October twenty eight\nSo that that's a huge concern that is definitely a concern and and I was disappointed about tonight because going all the way back to the Washington game of the second half they played well play well against buffalo yeah that that's a rookie quarterback but you know you held him off the scoring anytime you get shut out again in the NFL that's a win and again last week\nI don't pay any attention to thirty one wants to look at the orange that the the Packers given their backs up against the wall because of of ball security because of giveaways\nAnd short built field position for the lines but you know also a defensive player on the second here tonight it was a little bit better and again they did what they needed to do in the fourth quarter but\nI don't think there's any question defensively they they got away with one here thirty three to thirty a final score here tonight three to one of the Packers are now on this she's got a lot more phone calls to get to and we will get through it on the other side of the Packers O T presented by fellow windows and doors of Wisconsin more after this on the Packers radio network\nSo

unfortunate I don't I don't know if that's a new thing or not but my question are we wish we were talking during the game with with a touchdown lead to a joke you there\nIt shows like that that should have been a judge that when they reviewed it I was ... you know we was always told by\nBut yeah you know John perfection today than that will back in football days on Fox and stuff that the the the goal line extends around the universe or something\nBut what he crossed the week like never went out of biology touch the orange pie and seems like that ought to vent it touched out though don't you think Jeff and ah I I prefer not to talk to rather than just this to hang up\nA well okay Jeff I agree with you I I was a little perplexed about that myself I I don't have an answer for you I just know the officials ruled that he didn't have the ball inside the pile on but you're right I I was always under the assumption that uh the goal line extent that lives around the world I don't know if it's around the entire universe but it it is I'm so be it so\nUm I don't know I I don't know what to tell you there I I thought they should have been really touching on me as far as um the pace of the often send again I have to think it goes back to just Rogers into physical shape that he's in because we've not seen a lot of NATO we've not seen a lot of the hurry up often and we haven't seen the

of heavy lifting and actually worked in the field that she's proposing some of these ideas for\nAre you doing I assume a Walmart non juniors brewers are run to the world series\nOh my gosh it's so exciting how how fun with that too great victories last night to watch our present are Packers when\nIt doesn't get much better than our look much talk about this issue at hand you're running for the U.S Senate against him he vulnerable to play a little piece\nOf the first debate where Tammy Baldwin time to talk about health care but I I Want to play this for you and they just reaction to\nFollow you all have thirty seconds yeah that I did not hear something on how you think we can pay for this Medicare for all these are going to require higher payroll taxes or income for\nDoing nothing uh would cost more not when I heard that it's one of those clever little lines of the U.S energy bomb which drove through what was your reaction when you heard that as long as you'd like to be chided by by the moderator Charles ... leaving answered the question about\nWell it's classic ... evolved when she really doesn't even understand what he's proposing and I called her out on that\nShe doesn't even understand what's in the proposal that she has supporting the thirty two trillion dollar takeover of health care the Bernie Sanders bail I'm calling in Baldwin care she owns this now Steve this bill\nDismantle Medicare I Want people to hear that I Want seniors to hear that I've read the bill in fact I pressured her because she made fun of me for saying that and I said read your bill senator Baldwin she hadn't read it\nWhen you read the bill it's clear that he dismantle Medicare hit dismantle Medicaid dismantled the tri care program that our veterans use\nIt gets rid of the Affordable CARE Act one thing we can agree on\nAnd it gets rid of private insurance for private insurance ... has no clue what's in their own bills she's been hanging around Nancy Pelosi chew on to of course

debates now with your opponent and you hear these talking point some of them engine talking points about healthcare you're somebody that actually worked in the view as a nurse you you've been on the front lines you know what works and what those words\nWhat what's in your mind what is what is the direction our country if you're fortunate enough to win that election in November on November ... will should help to look like\nSure I'll talk a little bit about that but I also want to go back and explain why her plan is\nDisastrous for America or we need to have a patient centered approach to health care which is far far cry from what Tammy Baldwin is proposing\nAnd I have said it simply we need an army of consumers of information and tools to make decisions about their health care we've gotten so far away from a patient centered consumer driven health care plan for our country we didn't have a\nA totally I'm\nFree market approach to health care before Obamacare went into place and Obamacare went and took place and took us even further so what what do I mean you and I should be consumers have health care\nWe should be able to walk into our doctor's office just like we go in and take her car in for an oil change and they tire rotations something I've been doing an awful lot of lately\nAnd be able to say you know how much does this chest X ray cost how much is a throat culture

our country and then those became a little bit larger stores and then of course the the big mega stores are merged that we all talk about some of which are no closing\nI think you're right and and I think you're out of something it could see or signal the re emergence of some of these specialty stores where people are really invested in their product off in one product\nOr several products instead of having a wide range they focus on specific things ultimately maybe bring quality back to retail bringing better customer service back I think you're right it's just a niche there that that

I was in in the den\nUm and I was I had actually I had on the Internet uh I I had like the play by play going through the major league baseball's site or whatever so I I could see what was happening when I Would flip over to the Packers but but the brewers where my primary watch thing\nBecause again we were in special territory here I mean this is\nAt the end the brewers what they've been in the national league championship series you got to go back to what twenty eleven\nThey've only they haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two no I mean I'm watching playoff baseball in October no disrespect to hackers I'm a huge Packers fan but I I Would check in when again between innings and things like that I was I was brewer's all the way\nWhich surprises me to an extent is the numbers are out\nAnd those of us for whom the brewers were the primary do the watching the brewers primarily on TV we were in the minority now there there is a caviar here and that is that the brewers won Fox Sports one so you needed to have\nCable or the ability the live stream or something they worked on the ... broadcast\nThe Packers were on channel twelve and they were on ESPN so theoretically there is a larger number of people who could watch the Packers but here are the preliminary numbers according to the journal sentinel the brewers for nothing victory over the Dodgers\nHad an average twenty five point three household rating is pretty big meaning two hundred and fourteen thousand plus households were tuned to the game on the other hand the Packers they had a I'm thirty three point seven\nCombined rating from a again channel twelve and ESPN so that you are to platforms you could watch 'em on\nBut they uh they did the getting the brewers numbers were twenty five point three Packers numbers were thirty three point seven that translates into about two hundred and eighty six thousand washers so the Packers drew\nI don't know somewhere around Seventy thousand more households in the Milwaukee area that we're watching them and candidly\nThat surprises me that surprises me a lot\nBecause it is in fact playoff baseball\nIt it is in fact playoff baseball and of course you also had the Packers um well I mean let's face it this huge Packer team is struggling even though yesterday's game was great\nI I went with the ... with the brewers as my primary but for those of us who did we were apparently in the minority which again demonstrates that this is a great baseball area\nBut football continues to be somewhat of a religion so more people watch the Packers be curious to see if there's other conflicts whether or not that continues to be the case as the brewers march\nThrough the playoff continues which is what we're going to discuss when we come back\nThe Milwaukee Brewers team they can't get any respect\nStick around it's called twenty seven suggest wetter W.

J.\n\nHuh yeah I uh I totally agree with what you're saying I I was seeing that yesterday from a from ESPN they had a the Dodgers winning or last night's game six to zero and then even after you know what we've been seeing for the brewers are they have the Dodgers winning tonight a six to three years ago I mean\nYou know you're you're saying um you know a lot of the the narratives that are like you know can the brewers hot can they ride this hot streak and be you know this huge runs um you know run scoring Dodgers team right\nAnd and it's like you know we were very high I mean absolutely but this is more than just the streak and this is more than just you know October ...\nYeah I mean we might look like little kids eating up and down the line though yeah I mean let's look at this okay\nThe brewers play in a tougher division and the Dodgers do up and down you know so they play baseball you've got these unbalanced schedule so the brewers you know they're they're playing the cardinals and they're playing the pirates and they're playing the cubs all teams that are will over five hundred\nThat's the toughest schedule in the national league and the brewers won four more games than the than the vaunted Los Angeles Dodgers with their two hundred twenty billion dollar payroll did but of course that they're they're not on anybody's radar screens because well you know TV the TV people live in Los Angeles where they live in New York so they're not paying attention to the brewers and\nYou know and it can it's just I guess I'm I I'm venting I admit it but and maybe I've got this chip on my shoulder but this is a great story and deal people should be talking about how exciting this team is to come out of nowhere and be doing all this great stuff instead of well they're lucky you are writing the ... for whatever\nAbsolutely and I'm\nGlad you know one one thing that I didn't think it was interesting is\nUh you know you bring up a good point in the market various don't get as many nationally televised games so yeah we are writing a little bit under the radar if you're not from around the area yeah but I mean you look at our our kitchen staff which has been given you know re credit you know actually been given the respect but even with our pitching staff\nYou had a ... you have ... you know the Dodgers bats are just too high energy can there'll be story too many runs but then you look at it after games than it is just not not ...\n... exactly I mean and look and look it is it possible that LA is going to come back and and and when the series yes I I guess it's possible I I respect them they are a good team what I Am frustrated with is the lack of respect that our team is getting\nA team that had a better regular season record than the vaunted Dodgers and at least as of right now is leading in the series guaranteeing that you know worst case scenario there's going to be a game six in Milwaukee and candidly\nCandidly were it not for you know one bad pitch in one bit inning the Dodgers would be trying to win tonight to avert a sweep this has been the Dodgers have been at least in my opinion completely\nAnd totally out played by the Milwaukee Brewers but don't expect to hear that\nIf you tune into the national coverage um here's a tech I'm sick of hearing the national media keep on insinuating that the brewers are over achieving lucky and that NFL likely manager of the year ... council supposedly doesn't know what he's doing\nAbsolutely ... absolutely and I mean this is I guess this is what you come to expect when you have this great local teams on the national stage but I'm frustrated with it for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to ah let's see let's talk to Dan in Greenville Daniel delete the MBA good afternoon\nAt ... I think it's I think it has to do with the west coast a biased media he went to market out there you know I don't I don't necessarily think their their dog in the ... or it's just they're really hoping for\nA Dodgers to get in there for their ratings are greater back I'm with Kansas City won the world series\nWorld very very low rate [noise]\nYes I'm right I mean that makes it the the ideal the dream of the networks is Los Angeles and now the new it would've been Los Angeles or New York\nBut now that Los Angeles or the Yankees are out of it that the dream is the Dodgers and the red Sox you know two of the larger media markets Houston in Milwaukee oh my gosh that's it's flyover country ...\nOh my gosh that that it's flyover country how can you know what's that going to do so I I think you're you're probably on the ...

Robert Redford in that\nThat would be the big the big story and and I think I don't think they liked the fact that this new way of playing baseball is coming from Milwaukee\nYes at ... I think you're exactly right they resent it they don't understand it\nAnd they they okay this is just not the way it's done and and here you have this this little team out of Milwaukee and it's been able to do this and I I just look at I understand that but [laughter] but but it's somebody who's been a long suffering baseball fan for a long time and the huge brewers fan I think this is a special
