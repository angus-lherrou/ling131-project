I Want to ask you\nI'm a positive person I'd I'd done with the transitional greed you're familiar with that as well\nHow do we make forward progress in the time right now we're we're just one doing the tragedy but she was trying to figure things out\nWell I'll tell you uh you know we're used words like a pain and anguish and an anger um and uh and fear but uh one other emotion I felt\nOn Saturday a was a was a lot of love 'em and uh you know that came in part from you and and many in the greater community who reached out not just to me but to to people they know or Jewish or and express their their concern and support and\nThat gives me the the real fans that not all is lost and and you know as someone who's a part of the people who've experienced great tragedy um and challenge and uh and hatred and\nAnd persecution or throughout our history we have never given up and we've always you always pushed forward and and sought to overcome and knowing that in the end justice and righteousness than truth I'm\nAnd love prevails so I Believe that because there are so many people in this country who who share in that that that we can we can really change things and make a difference and if our political leaders aren't going to set the tone and aren't going to provide the leadership then it's up to us to do that\nDo you think that social media I mentioned this earlier in the program as well I think social media has an anger management problem you know somebody who actually enjoys Twitter and Facebook and positive reasons in in in the good things that can offer there is a negative\nAspect to it where it does see a lot of the ... the heat and I think drives some people some people who maybe aren't in touch with reality to do things they maybe wouldn't do\n\nIt there's no question that uh that the shooter in Pittsburgh that his hatred was still in the field and then he contributed to what you find on on social media um\nAnd I would agree with you and and I'll be honest with you there are times where I've been guilty of not really\nEngaging kind of a you know discourse that uh that one should because we we look at things today in such a zero sum game and we're so tribal uh and when I tried to do a blade is simply focused on\nTrying to get the\nOther person I Am in in conversation with\nThat I I Try to try to hear her hand in hand hope that that ville reciprocate and\nJust try to get to a point where we can speak to each other in a respectful way you know we don't have to agree on and nothing is going to be solved on Facebook or Twitter um\nWe need to refrain how we talk to each other and relate to each other before we could do anything else\nAnd so I I'm I'm hoping that you know out of tragedy we can [noise]\nThere's a silver lining in we can begin to to heal by respecting each other and by understanding how powerful are words can be especially when they come out of the mouth of a political leader\nRabbi ... my friend in one of the reasons I wanted to get you on the shows because I knew he would you would put it in that context there's there's opportunities here now for all of us to recover together and respond in the right way and and there's a lot more\nPositive good people out there than there are these people and I think you deliver that message better than anyone else thanks for taking the time to join this morning\nThank you might find God Bless you\n... I I wanted to get them on for a specific reason I think he understands clearly as a member of the Jewish community but also somebody who who understands the dynamic of what's happening\nThere are political context to this or it's not unique to the president's been spin around before that but there's also an a figure that can be pointed in in the direction of each of us\nThe fact that we have to understand each other that have to listen to each other done\nThere should be no reason at all less than a hundred years from the Holocaust and we're now talking about an increase in anti Semitism hate crimes directed towards the Jewish people no reason whatsoever and yet here we are\nThe slaughter of eleven innocence and the synagogue in Pittsburgh is they celebrate this thing I've lived this story I'm tired of talking about this story but I'm going to continue to do so because it's important to recognize there's some opportunity we\nCan do things to make a positive impact and that's why I wanted to bring a rabbi on some kind of give us a perspective from his human a rabbit my short hair off to Jeff Wagner that's next\nTo beauty engine nothing wrong with you on this Monday thank you for listening is always a couple of show knows one all of our interviews with the pod cast in Indonesia and you don't have time just go to my show page was in the interview Sean Duffy congressman from Wisconsin when I'm rabbi Herbert will be up in in an hour\nOr so a Monday morning quarterbacking a good message like oh James wages in ... Wisconsin busy shell today we started with football but we end with the you know the tragedy in Pittsburgh and a lot of people wing and I don't have time to read all the the attacks and comments but I'm the general feeling is\nThat there's something broken in this country and I think if you see a results like we saw in Pittsburgh where people are slaughtered and the place of worship\nThat's an easy something is clearly people should be able to go in my practice their face and not be children in place of worship and we've seen this play out in Texas ... creek no pits\nClearly people should be able to go on in my practice their face and not be killed in a place of worship and we've seen this play out in Texas ... creek know Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is a mass shootings in concert venues in Las Vegas and shootings in schools Columbine Sandy Hook Marjory Stoneman Douglas\nIt's a problem that's existed for a while not unique to this president's not need to one party or group of people\nInstead of to begin to show and I say it again there's an anger management problem in this country how we deal with it how we relate to each other how we manage these difficulties these people that can't seem to fit in and act out in the most violent extreme manner that's the tough part to figure out\nYou can throw guns in the equation as one of my one of my I guess and tons of Sean Duffy they'll find a different way they'll kill you in a different way they'll run you over those down yet you've seen that play out in in England in other countries\nYou got to figure out the dynamics politics\nPersonal conversation and senator earlier somebody who lived through one of these stories the best thing you can do is expose yourself to somebody who understands it looks at life differently than you do what it is a face their friends racial difference whatever that's why I have a lot of faith and young people because they understand\nThat there are many more commonalities in our differences\nUnfortunately right now we're focusing on the differences in is highlighting themselves Molly including the policy and I'll make this last point and they said this before President has an opportunity as someone who thinks he's a great communicator to calm reassure\nHis community which is all of us in the United states how he chooses to do that matter and the tax and when she uses to express his opinions are all very relevant and how we deal with it and to rile up\nMake worse never turn you want to use is not helpful and somebody who supports the president who's on the policy side it's a it's a teaching moment and opportunity for him as well highest office in the world\nPresident has a code of conduct that she should adhere to as well and I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done there just Wagner is up next which and coming up\nWelcome to the W T and Jay dot coms live streaming teacher right now WGM James broadcasting play by play sports or syndicator programming we do not have the rights to stream these broadcasts please check our website for the program scheduling upcoming games\nI'll be by any measure what's your driver the games right\nYeah I mean I Would agree with you there I think just wear a team and the game was was critical to get back to back touchdown dry there for the Packers and they raised the tenth floor deficit\nTo pick a a one point leave that right you're talking about Steve within the fourth quarter it started with a Fifteen yard reception about they add I'm at a screen play the air and Jones that went nowhere to even lost a yard Adams again for twenty um\nYou had a another past there and joins at one for one\nSome of the one thing full of you know you a long sustained gripe year it was a few ... that got him into the end zone\nA but a great move on the line of scrimmage by the rookie Valdez gambling I mean it really started his defender well I'm beat him inside his along strider so once you get beyond it it's hard to catch him in a perfect ball by Rodgers and take the coverage was for not so\nWhere that life came in the game was critical package that a lot of quick strike drives in yesterday's game they never really had a a long drawn out Dr against that ran the offense in rock\nYou know taking at one point lead with two forty nine left you feel like you're in pretty good shape I'm In the rams ultimately we're able to get just enough done what they are often\nLike math and joining me for Monday morning quarterbacking semi ... hotel casino or you want to weigh in the in the morgue and talking touched one for one for seven nine nine one six twenty run asked a question uh\nHe's looking at play calling the Pakistan or losing stress in the coming weeks maybe the good news is that close McCarthy will be his you I don't think that's going to happen the teen these are coached to put his foot on the gases play calling with seven minutes left made it difficult to wearing your thoughts great\nWell I you know that drive with I think it was six forty nine left in the game hackers were leading by one you know here's an opportunity to\nDo kind of assert yourself on our fence it and maybe close that came up put it out of reach are really put the pressure on Iran or to try and have to you know it's just something miraculous to win the game\nAnd it turns out being able to complete pass on first down for yard run on second now so you got a manageable thirty six and then every Rogers is fact so you lose your hours and then you're forced upon\nNow at the time it was a twenty five year old punk by JK Scott that I thought was disasters about oh my gosh did it just really need to have a punk flip the field and you had a scud missile for twenty five yards I actually in retrospect the thought that worked at the Packers benefit the rams to that ... they're not with a field goal not a touchdown\nAnd they did not did not have a lot of clocks so I'm thinking to myself this is my actually work out OK Aaron Rodgers going to get the ball back with a couple of minutes and I\nActually thought the party even though it was awful and I thought it worked out to the Packers benefit but it was off or not what the federal by the time a number of yourself but you're right you know you know you got one point lead seven minutes to go Aaron Rodgers down the field you can't do it three out there\nThat should be making the descendants actually I'm going to give him some good grades I think I was I was pleasantly surprised that against you know girlie probably arguably the\nBest running back in the NFL and in a in a sense of very productive I think that the third highest scoring office in the NFL\nThey showed up play some really tough depends especially in the first half didn't work out for them at the end but uh I was impressed by what's his defense was able to do against a really good team\nWhen they definitely keep it up on time to release them down the steps to run early on and if you look at some of the third downs the rams head of the game and a third and ten thirty nine\nThirty ten you know it was it was along down in different situations on third down which takes away play action which is great\nAnd um it it makes the rounds a little bit more one dimensional you covered snack on that first drive of the game or a fact I Believe Martinez that resulted in a ten year last on third and had very next Dr Kelly Clark mcgary gone for lots of eleven and through the night\nThey weren't getting it done and they slowed down ... Gurley and I know his final numbers look pretty impressive I don't feel like talk really took the game over\nHe definitely did not set the tone early on I thought the Packers first after the fence was outstanding maybe the best I've seen all the than the second half the ram started to do rams things and uh you know if it wasn't an awful defensive performance in the second half but certainly the team was was back in and what you're talking about finishing the half\nYou're thinking about how the end of that first half resulted the Packers are pitching a shutout they're deep and just popping up the ...\nAnd then you get a ball down at the one yard line but safety on the next play the package that the concept of the rams and then they get a touchdown before the break you know that ... not a die down at the one yard line that resulted in a safety really turned into eight points for the rams going into the half the Packers defense really effective to shut up until that\nPoint there's plenty to say one time you didn't want him to give it to her and Jones is on the house yard line way you'd like to see rises maybe role to the writer to the left and just give them some breathing room and that that was a turning point in the game\nGreg messing joining me for Monday morning quarterback was into my ... hotel casino after the break pacts than in the game in a surprise surprise I'm going what do you sense we'll see what Greg has now so I'm next when you're going to be TMZ samples are driving the game in the Packers the lead in a\nAt that point things and looking pretty good\nWelcome to Monday morning quarterbacking Greg massive Greg for my Pakistan to the game I'm going to go is defensive player because I was impressed by what the defense was able to do and that's a really really great brands team\nAnd one of the penny Clark to sex on a deep sense than to actually put some pressure on the quarterback and which is not something we've seen this year with Kenny clerk to sex knew very physical game idea\nA Packers line\nYeah three thanks on a day for the Packers Kelly Clark Mike mccarthy called him a pro ball player earlier in the week and he's certainly lived up to that a defensive line yesterday was was pretty strong by both teams and Donald was a force for the rams not as I can still made us presidents know Kelly Clark is\nIs in that category either impressive a press of young player in Provo caliber player um one good one bad than in my book I point six yard crushed by the Packers I think it's outstanding against the straw ramps run\nAnd I think does bode well for the future I don't believe we do see more of that coming up and more balanced with the Packers are offensive certainly helped\nUm but the one cat that jumped off the page to me was third down conversions just two of nine for the Packers that was the problem a couple of three announced especially in the fourth quarter you can't have that and it it it seemed to always come at a bad time and it puts the deep end\nBack on the field too soon I'm facing a potent ramps off and you give that aren't that opportunity after opportunity they're going to cash in to provide like third dealt with the with problematic three\nGreat when you're talking about termites armies decision earlier to take it on the end zone as a report by Mike Silver from Minnesota combat Montgomery and throwing a tantrum on the sidelines after he was removed from the game\nEarlier to take it out of the end zone as a report by my silver from F. L. dot com that Montgomery and throwing a tantrum on the sideline\nAfter he was removed from the game at least one player and I'm reading from the report leaders carry over from the incidents in Montgomery decision to disregard his coaches instruction and return the kick off your thoughts on that one\nYeah I don't know for sure and I do know that I'm a white elected not to speak with the media following yesterday's game I think that's a bad move on his part you have an opportunity to end it and just leave it alone and and now these questions well for that are into the week now what does it mean I really look at this what are your options are Montgomery\nIf you're talking about removing a player from his duties or training or releasing a player\nYou have to have a suitable replacement I don't think I'm going to get to relieve my gut feeling is that he does not get trade it I still think there's value in having a bird back on this team right now that you've got three um but I wouldn't be surprised if he was removed from kickoff return to do that than the greatest mistake\nOne you cannot make into by your coaches that an example need to be\nA couple of years the on the way out like across the river Jeremy loss from kick returned duty is running on both we never thought Jeremy Roth again now the interesting thing I mentioned you have to have a suitable replacement Robert Davis is eligible to practice the IRA hampering issue\nAnd I get it up practice last week he could crack this week but the best I think the backers have in their facility at returning and was pretty good at at last year's no he might be that suitable replacement but uh I'm leaning towards the end of the government was returning act I don't think you can make a mistake like that on your team a game\nAs Greg ... it is Monday morning quarterbacks sponsored by how do I mean hotel casino will do it again next week the news this next and your WGM Jay\nMonday morning\nLot of thirty five would be joined by rabbi shaken fervor or his thoughts on the watch the\nFor synagogue means going forward it's a it's a sad day\nMany of our Jewish communities across the country grieving for those eleven souls lost in Pittsburgh over the weekend I'll ask him that question a ten o'clock hour before I send the four biggest sources we sit across Milwaukee to stay there will be heavily focused on that shooting in Pittsburgh including local reaction from are you on a constant while he's Jewish Federation and others\nKind of detailing what their response and they're feeling after this horrific shooting in Pittsburgh and he joins me every Monday morning the editor right Wisconsin James which is in the mornings in the mornings so let me get right to it um I asked the question over the weekend we're going back and forth or a big part of the of the conversation now\nIs in the collective anger that we feel is a country when we when we have incidents like these these mass shootings and asked the question simply do we have an anger management problem in this country\nWell in the in this specific instance of the of the shooting I think the unfortunately ah anti Semitism is as old as history and\nWe you know when you look at the specific incident this could have happened other any president in any political time\nAh it's sad that people still look at it chooses the grand conspiracy that controls the world in when you when you have that kind of anti Semitic feeling out there that just will not die a you've you run into these kinds of tragedy but\nIs an interesting time before we move on to the the either as a Walker race um say certainly has roughly a week to make her case I actually welcome her to come out on the show and making it as well once you have to do to close that gap\nWell unfortunately she's going to have to figure out a way to to peel back to women uh\nIt's it's she's running right now on immigration and and a house supportive she is of Donald Trump's agenda and things like that that plays very well with the Republican base but it's not making their crossover connection to the independence\nTo the swing voters that are that are actually going to help her out or we're going to discover I think unfortunately the hard way just what is the Republican base number in this election\nDo you think health care is is the soul I don't want to say so but one of the most driving factors for independent voters in the state of Wisconsin\n[noise] no I actually don't uh it's it's a complicated issue uh people don't like Obamacare but people don't like health care in general and I every time that I'm told the healthcare is going to be the number one driving issue it never turns out to be that way\nJust like the year of the woman never seems to materialize until the next election cycle [noise]\nUh what what really seems to me the driving factor right now is people are just very uncomfortable\nWith the way Donald Trump does things in in ... in the pro Trump camp she needs to be to win the primary\nBut now it is she hasn't been able to make that leap to the to the general election\nJames we just an editor right Wisconsin joining me before going to break just real quick on eaters and a Governor Walker a depending on the polls which pulls you look at it it's a neck and neck race or governor up a little ... up a little or as we had against it lasts a week before the election next week people are already voting\nCould do could Governor Walker be impacted in this race by the the fact that there might be that anti Trump thing that you're talking about that that gives eras enough votes to beat the incoming governor\nWhy I think so unfortunately with the governor has run into and say you can't outbid the Democrats when it comes to spending on education or just ...\nThrown out a number of Scott Walker yourself spending more and have public education\nThan ever before and you just cannot how did the Democrats are going to always say that we need more and more and more and it's you know when or how much we actually put into it it's never enough\nSo Scott Walker's attempt to make that appealed to to try to soften that issue I think is falling a little bit short just just because they haven't been able to sell the actor reforms of the way that they should of over the last few years has the governor ran running an effective campaign\nIt's pretty effective considering the headwinds that he's running into a first of all it's like it's a mid term elections so that's always rough on the on the income and party\nSo that makes it very hard for for incoming governor when the president is the same party and there's a lot of backlash from the last election\nUh there is an additional factor we talked about media bias right now and the Wisconsin seat journal website you go to that website and they have their front page editorial\nSplashed all over their website page about how they're supporting Tony Russell because Governor Scott Walker's of divisive person and you sit there and go to the Democrats are divisive in this state whether you know where's your logic of the\nJames ... editor in ... Wisconsin after the break the week ahead for conservatives will throw a few more things change that's coming up next right here on WGM jak\nForty WGM Jay Monday morning forty five degrees at Radio City but joining us here every Monday by James\nWeight to send the editor right Wisconsin I James James uh we had for conservatives as we lead up to the mid term elections there's all that frenzy I voted already it's a lot of other people apparently have weekend for conservatives what does it look like\nWell the big day is going to be on Wednesday when the market pull comes out so\nTrick or treat coming for everybody involved in politics where data to do that if they always there and when I guess they always do it on Wednesdays and it just happens to fall that day out of that will be the last Marquette poll before the election and everybody's going to be looking at it and in parts in that poll downs of the ... and so the smallest detail\nAnd it's always a it's like Christmas for those of us so the politics we love the open up that President what do you expect to see in the polls that's different from the last thing\nI think you're going to see probably more more movement toward Scott Walker I think this is depending on the rights the wrong or right track wrong track members\nAh hopefully the Packer losses and and uh the ... don't affect those numbers but we'll see\nUh the other thing that is just going to cost and everybody that has a yard sign of not only are you going running the risk that your yard signs are going to get stolen but if you're handing out candy Wednesday night for trick or treat and you have a yard sign hand out the candy 'cause you don't want us to reflect badly on your cans of that\nMight be a nights or or a day in some cases afternoon late afternoon to take the yard sign out of the maybe people will be offended by by the fact that you support one candidate or the other and not impact their their decision to come to your house\nNow have is candy candy and free it's free this was Wisconsin the everybody's going to come to the door but like I say if you're a specially if you've ever Republican side in out good candy don't hand out the the little tents and pieces of candy or pennies\nAnd in your neck and it was you're actually doing it during the regular time at night on Halloween I I there's not that many of those communities letters of\nHis need to extend it one more hour though we're still pushing on the mayor for that\nAnd you go James waiters in the editor right Wisconsin joining me as he does every Monday morning at nine o seven I was going to talk to you James\nMore our though we're still pushing and the mayor for the James waiters and the editor right Wisconsin joining me as he does every Monday morning at nine o seven always good to talk to you James sixty Tony I'm next congressman Sean Duffy lots to talk about Congress midterm elections he's been all over the place for early as he's interviewed who ... them about that\nMovie with you on this Monday think you've been listening is always a great state of Wisconsin\nIn wherever you are joining me on the line now he's he's been pretty frequent just in the last year or so congressman Sean Duffy good morning congressman hey good morning the things I have now I Want to get your thoughts\nFirst about the the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh within our own ask a follow up on a question that that events happen over the weekend a loving people losing their lives to someone who uh targeted members of the Jewish community your thoughts on that\nYeah obviously it was a horrific and another example of you know what appear to be a drain person full of hate you know taken a firearm and maximizing destruction and you know I just I'm so grateful for law enforcement as well I mean here you have\nYou know those first responders you don't get into the scene and Russian and and uh so they were entered but obviously saved a lot of lives in the meantime and we're grateful for them or I Know that everyone who lives were spare in that replica attack was critical of for those house response as well\nAs somebody who lived through a mass shooting in the city of Oak Creek you know six years ago um the question always turns to after the the moments in Greece and the visuals and all that is what should we do I'm going to ask you from the perspective of being\nCongressperson punishment from Wisconsin is there a role for Congress years or something we can do we're never going to stop these completely but does or something we can do whatever level that might be what I in whatever way we could do it that could could potentially we slow these people down\nHere I think it's I think it's a hard question I'm ... and most people want to go to how do we implement gun control I was at a\nI'm a ... a a candlelight vigil last night um with our Jewish community and several people came up and in about that than the jerk reaction\nUh the the the the problem is you know receive in Europe if there is no you know a\n... right falls in those handguns in her hand guns those vehicles or you know pipe bombs\nYou know so I think people want to do harm um are the ones that will find a tool or with a machete the ... and don't look that harm people don't want to see the problem I have a ... there's been a degradation of a family\nUm for a number of reasons and we see people that are are being raised and it's tough to be you know I sometimes my wife goes nuts Fox on the weekend why going on in Congress being a single person at home with your kid is really tough\nUh but I think it makes a lot harder to and\nSo I think we're raising kids and a lot angrier and they dive into these video games the violence of the video games\nI think the seeds of love are are planted in a in a family around the dinner table um and I see that happening as much anymore and you see a lot of kids that are angry and detached and lonely\nUm and the end result of that is I think really on carrying hateful potential behavior and so we gotta get back to a ... I I think family and raising the kids that he answered all the\nWisconsin congressman Sean Duffy joined me so how do we do that in in in the in the country to celebrate the freedoms of people when we have as as I said earlier on the program an anger management problems a lot of it has to do as you said with with the way we raise our kids with families have disintegrated\nHow do we how do we make a difference in this problem and and mass shootings are occurring a lot more frequently than a lot of us would like to see let's put it that way\nYes so I'm I'm On the family side and I was I'm a conservative and I go who gets to decide well conservatism is Steve and I I think that it's important that we support families I don't support families and the tax code there was a recent article that said well hey\nIf a so we have a birth rate right now at one point seven uh children you know for a a per couple um I don't have a point of a child but that's what the average is to just to maintain a population you have to be a to point one\nWho who've never thought that the kind of violence and overt hatred\nThat we've experienced other places or would we wait he confronted with it in America in a neighborhood like squirrel hill a you know the neighborhood where Mr Rogers mhm uh once lived she gets home is just down the street from tree of life synagogue\nUm it's it's honestly I'm it's baffling but unfortunately for the past two years there's been such a rise in division in our country and um [noise] in\nHate speech and it acts of of hatred and much of it has been\nTargeted against the Jewish community you look at the FBI hate crimes report or for the past few years there's been an increase in incidents against the Jewish community\nUh and it's risen precipitously the last couple of years that the greatest number of hate crimes committed against a community\nA religious community as the FBI um denotes it America is against the Jewish community ... a DL which is\nBreaking news weather traffic ammo home all the Packers breweries in bucks we are ... radio station news radio do any GM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nAt ten o'clock it's forty seven degrees a few sprinkles otherwise mostly cloudy tonight Lutheran forty two from the WC I'm Jay breaking news center ... first responders or call to camp lake Indian Ocean county this evening after a report a plane crash happened deer seven\nAround the Wisconsin Illinois border the Illinois based pilot was able to get out of the plane and swim to shore\nThe plane will be removed from the water Tuesday\nPresident Trump has been criticized for a lack of compassion in reaction to the massacre at the tree of life synagogue is flying to Pittsburgh Tuesday the president told Fox is Laura Ingraham he's looking forward to the trip\nWell I'm just going to pay my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and uh some of the people that were so badly hurt so and I really look forward to going I would've done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already had disruption [laughter] but I look forward to going to Pittsburgh tomorrow\nWisconsin congressman Sean Duffy calls the shooting horrific stuff he tells W TMZ seeds to CD it's tough to pinpoint how the country got to this point\nWhat's changed is I think that's the the deep dive we have to have and look at our society and\nOur communities and go what what different what's gone wrong and\nHow do we have a hard conversation about fixing it\nCredited police in Pittsburgh\nSociety and our communities and go what what what's gone wrong and not in our conversation about fixing it\nDefeat credited police in Pittsburgh for stopping the shooting no bail for the van accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats across the country that is what federal prosecutors requested in Miami federal court today prosecutor said saved our sales is a risk of flights and a danger to the community\nBut attorney Daniel ... who is representing the accused fifty six year old says let's not jump to conclusions\nHe's innocent until proven guilty and nobody has proven guilty of sending those those devices in the mail\nA judge will hold a hearing a friday and whether sales can be released on bail sport strapped in whether ...

through the shopping season that so many people have done in the past regret so much\nDid you know that if you work for a small worm lawyer somebody other than a giant company\nAnd if they offer you a four O. one K. did you know the your expenses that you're paying on that four one K. are usually four to five times as much as they are for somebody who works for a giant company\nSmall businesses midsize businesses face an enormous administrative burden and cost offering four one K. plans and those costs in most cases are passed on to you\nIt's weird but it now costs more\nTo have a four one K. if you're employed by a smaller employer than it is for you to have your own IRA or Roth IRA with a low cost company\nAnd that's why I recommend to you that if you do work for a smaller company that you put in to their four one K. only up to the match\nAnd then after that if you're disciplined you put money into your own IRA with one of the low cost companies on my investment guide Clark dot com\nSo this is a terrible problem that why is it that somebody who works for a smaller business which more than half of Americans do\nBecause you've got to protect yourself from the liability risk that could come with that property is a more enhanced risk\nThe other experience people can share with you who own rental property by college campuses properties tend to get beat up a lot more than a

interactive traffic maps right now but WGM Jay dot com and on the ...\nWe now he joined Clark Howard already in progress news radio WGM Jay\nRather huh\nNot so he's so you so you'll be able to answer the question\nIs what my oldest brother um when his ... he had already retired and then his wife are tired and they have no real permanent address and they just go wherever and right now they're living in Arizona for six weeks\nAnd then they're going to go to Japan for four weeks and just wherever the deal is on a cruise ship or at a resort or travel internationally they're going to go to\nItaly for two months in the fall and they're doing everything on the cheap\nSo the question of where you dominant style I'm like I'm not gonna give you the book cancer I mean to give you the real answer okay\nFor inch do for instance you know tax reasons yeah insurance or even write a voting I mean how do you do that if you're if you're traveling\nRight so you establish residency wherever it's almost a convenience like a lot of people will register Montana because the taxes are so favorable and that's where they'll dominant style or they do so in Florida you work for a state with no state income tax\nIs rule number one mhm and usually what you do is you do I'm now again this is not the book cancer this where people really do okay if I give you the really do answer\nWhy I called okay so what people will do is if they have a friend or relative or whatever in a zero income tax say you Lisa room from them and their home and you sign up with these\nProbably never used the room but you just pay 'em like a hundred dollars a month to be able to call their place you're home\nSo you don't actually because we have to own property and know your residency state you\nKnow the big thing is you don't want to set foot ever in the state you live in now if you come from a high tax state you live in\nConnecticut and that's why we want to find as you say you're never and Connecticut again right\nIf you go if you go back to visit relatives in Connecticut you stay in a hotel in somewhere else in the tri state area and you drive over to see 'em but you're not spending any time in Connecticut because the big thing in high tax states they're going to try to come back at you and say wait wait wait wait\nWe don't really believe you're a resident or whatever\nAnd you've been here a lot you're not there are a lot when you leave Connecticut you leave Connecticut\nOkay so you just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been to your state and decide to live there\nYeah and it practically what most people do is they do Florida Texas or Montana are the three that are done most often but there are special advantages to Montana\nAnd so if you look around on the Web and you'll see where people are posted articles about why they use Montana as their dominant style [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nIs in almost all these plans if you don't pay off the balance in full before the interest holiday ends interest is retroactive today one usually it around thirty percent interest three zero so you thought you were signing up for a benefit that ends up being a curse\nThan the last factor is that store cards or looked at as John credit in the way your evaluated in credit scoring credit reporting and the way a potential winder looks at you when\nYou've taken out store credit so just follow this rule was the one from the late Nancy Reagan just say no Georgia's with us on the Clark Howard show George let's talk about what's going on with your daughter\nYes sir thank you for taking my call Clark guys may share that certainly um well\nMy daughter is going to be turning Twenty one this coming Sunday and my wife and I have thought to get her started into adulthood to start a a Roth IRA for her\nYou're definitely not from Wisconsin because in Wisconsin there would be that you'd have a big party at a bar for her\nTo order over\nHis legal drink\nAbsolutely absolutely but no do where where are the more fiscally responsible parents in way rather than giving her a twenty four pack that will be gone within a few hours\nBy All right that allows for it\nThe city or a fire right that allows for you know hopefully decades\nMy goodness a twenty four pack that would be gone a few hours do you know uh do you know how many beer I can actually handle before I'm just like it's over\nWell you're you're probably similar to me I Know that I kind of laugh when they put that born on date because I joke with folks that are here in my fridge should have died on day\nBecause it fit in there so long [laughter] yeah I I can handle about one and a half the year before I'm just done\nSir absolutely\nBut so you you are not looking for the alcoholic celebration you're looking for the financial celebration for\nHer ... absolutely and so this roster you're going to do has she ever had one before is this brand new for her this would be a brand new she working\nShe will be a she has a little bit of income right now but I Would expect that by the end of the year she would have at least a thousand dollars of income that we would planet opening with a thousand dollars so [noise] hopefully by the end of the air she'll she'll actually be graduating and hopefully we'll have employment as an elementary school teacher\nJobs is you know are so relatively plentiful\nSo it's not a question of if she can find a job it's just is it going to be the job she wants so yeah I wouldn't worry at all about her crossing the thousand dollar income thresholds so doing a a Ross for her for a grand is such a wonderful gift because\nAt Twenty one\nWait wait wait you said she's graduating from college and she's only Twenty one\nYes you know most people don't finish college now till twenty three twenty four\nShe had she actually had skipped a a year of high school because she entered an advance program with say school up in northwest Missouri and uh it gave her both college credit at high school credits\nAnd ah she found that she didn't particularly like that program is supposed to be a two year program\nBut then she took it upon herself when she found that she would have to go back to high school to finish her a high school diploma at her old high school she decided to contact the president of one of our state universities and\nContact him directly saying you know\nThe problem she was having at the school and he moved toward the admission officer who then said well if you just get your GED we can go ahead and take those credits which went to college\nAnd so which she should have been starting her senior year of high school she was actually a a freshman in college that was about halfway through the freshman here already with a number of credit she had\nYou have one industry has daughter there and what I Love is that she advocated for herself\nAnd Seventeen years old and made this happen for her and she's got a bright future in front of her and the ... doing that at Twenty one the number of times her money will double that thousand dollars will double\nYou're adding I mean just simple math you're adding like a whole additional cycle at least a veteran army doubling by doing it so young\nRight and my my question was is is the Roth IRA the best way to go I was\nThree hundred percent agreement okay no there's not even gray on that that is the perfect thing you can do for her good\nAnd um I have a guy I don't know if you've seen it at Clark dot com that's a basic investing guy and he can get that set up and all and like ten minutes time and open a shell account and then she can find it with a thousand you're going to give her and she'll be all set\nAll right very good I appreciate your advice on that thank you\nWell that is great and congratulations to her doing something like a throwback getting an undergraduate degree by your twenty first birthday John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n... thanks for taking my call I have a lot of the last me over the years\nWell thank you very much you have something that's been pitched to you you want to run by me telling me\nShortly I heard you're talking about the long term care insurance but mostly the traditional pie and we are just to insurance agent I my uh state planning attorney who recommends a whole life policy\nThat you got the ability to use for a certain amount of long term care insurance up there in years at a certain amount for both me and my wife\nIt's a very smart move by the insurance industry\nHas the long term care market has mostly exploded\nBecause the number of people who claim long term care and his turned out to be far larger than the insurance actuaries expected and so the big push in the insurance industry is what you heard the pitch for\nWhat happens is you buy a whole life policy with a writer for what sometimes is referred to as a living benefit where if you never need long term care you just have a death benefit that goes to the beneficiary designation policy\nOn the other hand if you do need long term care\nWith money that would have been paid out at death instead is paid for the benefit of care for a long term care facility here in your home a nursing home whatever up to the limits that the policy calls for and you've purchased\nSo for the insurance industry what he does is it caps their risk and what it does for you is you have a premiums are ... you pay and you know that that benefit up to that dollar amount will be there for you\nOkay is that how it was explained to you\nAnd very much so I I guess the question is I've always our but it is your ... to go which a term insurance ... yeah I'm well covered there and I was wondering what I'd be too much for that\nTo get a whole life policy that I don't need to check that\nYes we're dealing with a very broken system so long term care there are a small number of companies that still sell us on my long term care information at Clark dot com and you don't know what will happen with the premiums if you buy one of those so despise you certainty\nBut what it does do is you're paying a great deal of a premium for that certainty\nSo you are you someone who could ... you might not like it but you could afford the premiums if over the years ... years the long term care premiums escalated\nYes that's true\nIf that's your case go with traditional long term care insurance and go with one of the mutual insurers that are on the list like um northwestern mutual is an example would be a better choice Joe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\nHey ... factor thing like oh certainly got a problem\nA concern hair and age that I Want to live here and there are several several ... page as the

employers to find workers wages are still staying stubbornly low [noise]\n\nWalk away just a moment [noise]\nOr something that absolutely disgusts me and it's known as a covenant not to compete where employers\nIn order to have his work for them make a sign this thing where we can't go work for anybody else and are chosen profession or whatever period of time is legal in whatever state it is\nSaid to Massachusetts is rolling back as confidence not to compete because it's clear that industry of Massachusetts has not been nearly as dynamic and the tax field is it has been in states that have done away with confidence\nAnd\nEmployers are in a position in most states where they get you to sign one of these covenants where you can't go work for anybody else\nPay a bit so I'm On you even if they dumped you\nYou can't go work for anybody else for a period of time can't earn a living\nEven when they don't want you anymore\nFinancial Times of London reports today that one in four American workers now one in four\nAre uncovered is not to compete and this is something is national policy if\nWe want to do something for the American people and allow people to earn a decent wage we will all women ate\nAbility except maybe in the executive suites\nEmployers ability except maybe in the executive suite\nTo require anybody this and governance not to compete remember that ridiculous thing we're Jimmy Johnson sandwich shop was having sandwich delivery people sign a covenant not to compete that they couldn't go deliver sandwiches for anybody else\nI mean this is insane stuff\nAnd we should be able to take our skills to the highest better wherever that takes us in the marketplace you're listening\nTo the Clark Howard show [noise]\nIs driven according to AAA ten thousand eight hundred and forty one miles\nEach year so like nine hundred nine hundred miles a month I guess so what's it cost to operate that vehicle on the average place per year\nTen thousand forty nine dollars which is just a whisker under a dollar a mile now what's really interesting about that when consumer when I'm starting that consumer horse or a triple a desert overall cost vehicle ownership\nIs more in the range of around sixty cents\nBut when they take new vehicles put that in the equation and every last expense involved with it even the parking you pay for various places over the course of a year if you have to go places you pay for parking you end up it over ten thousand dollars\nNew vehicles cost a fortune\nAnd think about it if you instead of driving a new vehicle that one that's out there that you're tired up but it still works just fine and you're treating it so bad\nWhy don't you go pay somebody to detail it make it look brand new again on the inside make it feel like a new vehicle to you again and keep driving that thing instead of spending all that money\nOn those new wheels because you know it's like being on a hamster wheel right because as soon as you've got that new vehicle and just a few months it's not so new anymore either is it\nBrian's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brian how are you there oh sorry\n[noise] live life has been driving the same car for twenty two years\nTwenty two okay\nHow did you end up coming right here right now the talk about me trying to get people to keep a car ten years or longer and your wife runs a vehicle for twenty two years what last that's right well lasted twenty two years Brian\nUndergoes a Toyota Camry Toyota Camry and how much\nIn terms of repairs and things like that anything major like that other people would have said I don't have the stomach for fixing this I'm going to bail anything like major happened over those twenty two years\nIt's been a great car we love it and we're thinking about getting another one now it's the same transmission same engine integrate car fan I'd asked as\nWell that that is a great story that here well how can I be of help because it sounds like you're the one who should be leading other people here are your wife should be\n... blowout so we're looking for another car I'm probably another Toyota Camry and um I Would consider buying use but the hurricane was here a year ago hurricane with it\nOr alarm off when you're in Florida and\nThat yeah I'm concerned that there were cars that were flooded and maybe someone got their car repair themselves and that information never makes it to the car title and I'm going to end up with a bad car\nAnd that could happen and that's why a you know when I talk about checking vehicle title history that's only one step of two major ones when you're looking at buying a used vehicle and the other\nIs to have the vehicle inspected by the whoever the Toyota mechanic is who's taking care of your wife's Toyotas for the last twenty two years\nBecause they'll be able to tell they'll be able to there'll be signs that they know to look for where they'll be able to see if a vehicle was suffered any water damage\nOkay now we're far afield I should tell you we're far enough away from Hurricane Irma now\nThat it would be less likely that there was still be a flawed vehicle somebody would be trying to pass off in the marketplace that could happen but it's not as much an issue as it is in the immediate six months after a major hurricane\nOkay but are you and I make another two yes\nAnd that is that Toyota is having trouble getting people interested in buying ... cameras\nBecause the market has shifted so much too little SEVs\nAnd in fact traditional passenger cars are now down to a third of the car market or vehicle market from being nearly two thirds of the market just a few years ago because I look around everybody's driving\nA heavily these smaller SEVs which are basically just an SUV looking top put on the same car platform as a passenger car may have been so I get pretty good fuel economy and all that but that's what people are interested in so\nYou may find you can buy a new Camry\nAt a fantastic price yeah\nAnd not even by one that's a year or two old since since your wife likes to keep a vehicle for two decades she could go ahead and get a new and potentially instead of a used and not have to worry about the ... thing\nSo you think I might find good prices on families than your cameras\nSo yeah oh yeah I mean you know the the sedan market is just so on the left right now\nWell I I had been talking to dealerships and I started with a Costco program and um I've been trying to negotiate lower right and I am and I'm finding dealers don't really want to go lower than that\nWell that's because the Cosco car buying program is such a a smooth the equivalent of the largest car dealer in the United states and so the price that Cosco member debts the Cosco car buying program is going to be a very good price\nAnd I'm curious equipped is your wife wants what kind of price are you saying on a new Camry\nOn a Camry s e Costco price an outlet and at that I Want to pass on to you and the list of the listeners can we as a out the door\nIncluding taxes and all that junk the is\nThe Cosco price is twenty four two and change and um so then I started talking to other dealers and the\nProblem that I found I was asking for okay what's your best fries including or dealer the so finally I started asking them eight out the door fee and they were adding on\nAll kind of joke I learned that when you negotiate for a car you have to get out the door the otherwise it back on all kinds of stuff right when you thought you had a good price\nYeah the the Wednesday drunk the versus the friday drunk favors the Tuesday during the ... yeah ... yeah it's really crazy isn't it so I'm not a you know I don't know twenty four are you comfortable with that are you still want to work used\nI think um for a comfortable that so\nI think the cause of the history of ownership and how much your wife is like having the cameras she's already had this one will seem completely different because technology's changed so much in two decades I'd say why don't you splurge and buy or the new one\nAnd that we're coming out of my mouth\nAnd that we're coming out of my mouth will is with us on the Clark Howard show how long will\n... will how can I serve you\nA light at that a a retirement and that's a question\nLike how\nAre you a ... foot center set in my work for a while to shut it

explain why you're thinking of flipping\nA work doesn't match fly a match and just in case I ever needed to pull up the principle of the raw\nOkay tax free\nAll right ... that's a great idea the thing is though make sure you do that raw with one of the real low cost providers\nSawyer absurd on the talk about pretty regularly so and\nSo you want to put in the amount you'll end up putting into the

feature on the show a show poll it's up on Twitter follow me a W teams I Steve the question today\nThe president as ordered more than five thousand troops the U.S Mexico border my Paul as to support his decision to secure the border with US military that question is up right now on my WGM Jay Steve Twitter page joining me now is US Senator Ron Johnson good morning\nOr the by doing\nGood I wanted to get your thoughts quickly on the on the shooting over the weekend in Pittsburgh and I can just perhaps a larger question what this means in this ongoing conversation about the violence in this country\nWell obviously these things are occurring with greater frequency of suspenseful slaughter of instant worshipers it's an active pure evil I don't think there's any politics involved in this whatsoever uh in terms of the act in terms of looking for solutions I I\nKnow the food and lying in the federal government I I find solutions are going to be more likely derived from strengthening communities fate stronger families\nAnywhere folks were ... or what you're saying you know all the broken families are really nation you know people literally can you know sitting in a basement that go on line or see all kinds of Haiti is information on on\nSocial media which is no longer able because of free speech so incredibly complex issue and problem a ... there's no one profile of a of of people do this but so often they're they're just loners the the ... never even\nAnd just loners that never even if it's in this case doesn't even show up on on local law enforcement radar until they perpetrate so such a hideous act\nSo let me ask this question\nAnd ... there's always this this rush to do something about guns and and I and I made this point yesterday you could pass a gun law and and and whoever this person is or persons that are intent on violence will find a different way we see that play on Europe all the time\nMovie now I aside for a moment is there anything we can do on the law enforcement side additional resources additional technology that makes the connection between people that are\nFrankly looking to do these kinds of acts and protecting people that are the victims of them\nAgain it's it's really difficult you know what to do it for you not guilty yeah\nNow in the case the bomber again which proves the point I mean if you want to kill people there are other ways of doing it then just with guns we've seen vehicles use bombs or you know it's the last six people out there ah\nI don't know the exact history of of the of the individual that this and all these bomb threats but it looked like he had a pretty long wrap sheet and you could potentially make the argument he might have then you know you should maybe should have been in in jail or or some kind of institution as well um\nBut again I it's it's if there's not one piece of legislation passed I mean we in terms of gun legislation we have three hundred million guns\nIn America I'm evil people are going to gain access to them either legally or illegally I I think in the case of this this gentleman I don't know for sure but we haven't heard anything about him is painting his Twenty one guns illegally\nSo he apparently went through the background check in past you know again the problem of gun control advocates are have is showing that whatever they're proposing which generally reduces the freedoms of law abiding citizen citizens ... there\nAre ... are regarding their Second Amendment rights they can never showed that that the first say short of actually prevented previous senses incidents as much less something in the future\nSo yeah I'm I'm I'm interested in in his legislation they actually work access to some building these legislation that has a good name that that sounds like it's going to solve the problem in a class the example that\nRelates to border security now one of the things I've done in fact held more than two dozen Harry's on some aspect of border security and in my homeland security committee because I just listed going back to Reagan's amnesty they'll hear the frustration we\nPassed there were holes are going to fix this problem and then if I go through that tally I talked about how many people in this country illegally at that moment and it goes from about what we tell us about one and a half million but to point seven million took advantage with amnesty\nAnd then it goes to three and a half into sex and the nine ten eleven twelve and we have all these these legislation the title say hey we're solving this problem and we never do so that you know I just talked to anybody thinking there solutions I'm In ... as it relates to these tragedies in the federal government I have my doubts\nThat you mentioned you know I've talked about immigration law and you mentioned the border security one of the big stories it's kind of swirling out in the news cycles this caravan coming from Central America through Mexico is this a real

happening in and around our world I started the smarts\nAnd helpful to bring on the other side of Congress let's talk now with\nCongressman Mike Gallagher from the eighth congressional district in mourning\nThe insulation and call them today\nNine nights with you on this we're joined by\nCongressman Mike Gallagher from the it's rational district congressman I I used it before\nWe went to break the midterm elections\nWe can use the cliche that it's the most important elections in her lifetime I think there's a lot at stake for conservatives and Republicans are all Americans in this election in your mind what is the I guess the singular issue I think that that most people most voters are looking and saying this is why I'm going to vote ...\nWell I think we'll have a test of a couple of different hypotheses wanted these sort of old James Carville the economy stupid hypothesis right and the economy's going great right now I mean certainly we have very low historically low unemployment in Wisconsin we want to continue that trend and also um apparently address\nUh the worker shortage that we have in the workforce challenges that we have at the federal level we've been able to compliment what\nThe governor has died at the state level for regulatory reform tax reform in ... in Portland now is that when we talk about things like growth about three percent we can kind of get lost an abstract that out what that means is that there's more people working\nMore people earning a living there's upward pressure on wages more people being able to provide for their\nFamily more businesses expanding and making it back into Wisconsin\nI doubt it errands yesterday really in Wisconsin and are looking to expand and invested it can get it and that's just just good for human beings trying to live their life and work out five days do you want to continue that progress\nAnd not go backwards that strong argument for voting Republican I also think that health care is not going away as an issue or or health care system is broken I'll concede it was broken prior to Obamacare but I think all the evidence suggests that Obamacare made it far worse I Swear I think it incredibly troubling that you're seeing so much misinformation\nAnd really outside the bounds of eastern the attacks like the ad that dad cold running against going broke me up at least the jak thing that you know Republicans want to kill small children that is crazy and also what that practically mean\nIs that we're willing farther away from seeing real reform in our health care system because the issues being demagogue millions of dollars are being spent\nOn it and that's just a disservice to the American people it's why I've tried to focus on the issue price transparency working across party lines with a Democrat from Colorado because my fundamental belief is that regardless of how you feel about the role the federal government healthcare\nWe're never going to have power as patients unless we understand what we're paying for when the ... when we uh uh interact with the healthcare system for women could decipher our health care bill\nAre you optimistic that whatever happens in in a number six whether they house remains with a Republican majority or the Democrats assuming the the role of leaders there then we can get to any solutions on the on the on the thing you just talked about\nWell at some point we'll have to write because we continue to spend more and more money and we're not getting a better outcome right we're spending Eighteen percent\nOf our GDP roughly on health care that's effectively double what the average among advanced industrial country span and all the indicators are going the wrong direction we have a a ... down the ride life expectancy went down the last few years\nSuicides are up federal cetera these are all complicated phenomena you can't sort of a boil it down to one variable but the point is we're spending more money and getting a work products at some point and its crowding out all the all the other priorities right I mean what we want to make an investment in infrastructure who\nWant to continue to rebuild the military ah\nBut if we're spending all our money on a system that's not delivering for us that we're not going to be able to do it so my hope is that men and women of good faith are willing to put the interest of the country ahead of their own narrow parochial political interests because if you're willing to stay or do anything to get elected including demagogue ing that issue you're just doing a disservice to the American people are going to get worse\nCouple of minutes left with the Congressman Mike Gallagher from the eighth congressional district or the president has a as now ordered more than five thousand troops the U.S Mexico border do you support that decision you're you're a marine what do you think about that potential solutions secure the border\nWell we have to secure the border or no doubt about it when I was in the marine corps for ... for uh about a year I was assigned to the drug enforcement agency\nAnd I get counteract products work did some work down at the southern border is not secure we have the technology to secure or we lack right now is the will power um and we absolutely cannot have a country we do not know who's coming in and\nOut of our country and who's coming across the border I Would not however that the majority of people here illegally are are not swimming across the Rio Grande and the data the nights are overstaying their visas so there's an internal enforcement um but this is why we need we need to provide more resources to the border patrol um er into\nThe immigration and customs service because this is actually not the appropriate use of military resources I mean I Would rather see Korean soldiers sailors and airmen deployed\nPoland or to the Korean Peninsula which is at a time when we're dealing with the writing of crisis but um that's really Congress's fault and if we want to point fingers at the president we have to look to ourselves and say for a couple of decades that we we just punted on immigration problem and so it's getting worse and worse and I think you may argue\nYour average citizen and not just the ... not withstanding how device divisive issue it but says simply lifting\nWe need a system where we need to secure our border we're gonna make it easy for people who want to come here the right way who want to work you want to pay taxes than it actually earn citizenship but we're going to make it difficult if not impossible for people to come here illegally and it's going to be\nWell for people to come here illegally and it's going to be transparent can be functional I think you can get people having a conversation but unfortunately we're not having it right now and we keep leaving everyone said why that\nPerson like gallery got about thirty seconds left but one of the textures wants to ask you about the climate solutions caucus what does that mean and I assume you're a member of it\n[noise] I Need a so or climate change I just think there's a lot of people in each other\nOr certainly sort of become a kind of articles religious faith on the left 'em and certain apocalyptic production um but I think on the right when he goes knowledge that the climate is changing it's an interesting way but simultaneously have the humility to recognize that we still don't fully understand the phenomenon\nWe can have a good agreement with our president of the party about what you and striking that balance between\nUm allowing the economy to grow having er about manufacturing agricultural sector while also protecting\nWhat grade about Wisconsin which is their natural resources clean water clean air or is it very difficult thing to do but in fact I think they do and so uh we're just trying to have a conversation perhaps arrive at an intelligent environmentally friendly and economically probably out it as a result of that discussion\nCongressman Mike Gallagher always great to talk to you thanks for taking a few moments to talk of his bag you\n[noise] I said he's one of the smartest

frankly um encourages more people who vote so I think ultimately that's to the great thing well south Milwaukee\nOne of their residence his name was Daniel yawn\nNoticed that there was a problem with their absentee ballot instructions\nAnd then there was a ballot just the instruction provided by the sophomore clerk's office now let me say this I'm not indicting the clerk these things happen um there's always a remedy the one thing that's great about the state of Wisconsin was if you isolate and very rare\nInstances of the opposite uh clerks do a tremendous job of running our local elections not an easy process by any means\nI've known a few clerks in my day they do a great job of running election so all the folks who like to talk about some hanky panky and all the crazy stuff happening elections\nTalked to a clerk ask her what goes in the process you get a much different of opinion and and or frankly we should be encouraged by the work that they do but I still think it's important to point out instances that come up just saw the voters in in any community south Milwaukee or or elsewhere are up to speed on what's happening\nSo the clerk's office insult walking center slip out with these absentee ballot\nAnd they have the wrong instructions on which side to fill up the little ... and it keeps your choice the instructions said to the rise of the candidates name it should've

they're already on the ballot but I understand why they do these things but in this case you can make good if you have a question about your ballot you can certainly contact the clerk's office in the

mentioned that it was meaningful that we met in a synagogue and house of worship [noise] um and I think that there is a shared commitment we had a lot of security there last night but we don't\nWant

was towed because you were in the space I guess technically you weren't supposed to be there but it was no harm no foul because you had your friends permission to be in that spot\nExactly yeah no I think they should call and I get I understand that there is balancing act because this gets abused look I I get it if I had a paid outdoor\nSpot for example and I I pull into\nI don't know my my apartment building and it's outdoors in somebody's in my spot I I'm going to be hacked off I I understand that so that's what the balancing is\nThe problem though is with these tow truck drivers\nAnd look there they're not doing this for the convenience I I think people are doing it because they want to make money\nThat's why you swoop through apartment complexes at three thirty in the morning and I get it the argument would be well don't leave your car parked where it's not supposed to end you're not going to have these problems I'm just saying that there needs to be a balancing between tow truck drivers driving through and cleaning out\nYou know spots without any regard to why the car is there and whether or not it is really a problem or not\nCommon Milwaukee tongue or there'll be him Jay\nHey how are you doing what about a ... so I Lived in an apartment complex and I had a permit but it's a lot with you and dark came up go to work early in the morning and\nAh there was a truck getting ready to hook up towards like oh dude I Lived here so we got from it shows like yours I thought well why don't care that says well I'll get it and says why are they started\nAnd I said well you're are you hooked up to the car you know just try to read\nBecause well already put my hand on it just sort of all it's crowded laws so it's really\nInteresting so I got my card I drove over the hump when I go to work and you know what if what if he were to kill a few of them told me about it and I did have a quote away kind of same situation you know it costs to the solar cars storage good all that and and some of that that'd be good for they did it come on like\nWhat will write in and again this isn't it's not like anybody is complaining your in your spot you're where you are supposed to be no I understand your tag has fallen off\nBut again it's not like somebody who's complaining hey there in my spot et cetera et cetera you're it's just\n... and the tow truck driver doesn't care he doesn't care whether you're allowed to be there or not all he cares about if you I'm going to look this car up I'm going to pull it all away and I'm going to I'm going to collect three or four hundred bucks for this guy who cares and I'm just saying I think that the pendulum has swung too far the other way and there's a lot of people who are getting abused by this\nWas her house and I'm like no it's a a while ago with two years ago I think there was a guy same situation came down\nWith our code and are they out of ... you probably know truck driver and I believe the driver the corporate driver went to the boosters everybody when he got out of a truck\nWhich shot the guy that was followed them right and uh I I don't know when that was just not really on the news and stuff like that but you know I mean there there are still without it we don't really hear about that but I I kind of look at it like they don't put the boots on cars comic construction oil look I got my head on your art like are you know I Would say\nWell that's why I mean ... that's why at least according to the story in the paper today that the guy says in this particular tow truck company I don't know the facts of it one way or the other but\nWhat the guy's claim as he keeps his I came out while they were jacking up my car\nAnd in Milwaukee because they had such a problem with what you're talking about they have an ordinance that says you can't it's not the state law but it's an ordinance in Milwaukee you can pay fifty bucks if you're out there before they towed away they're supposed to drop it down\nHe says this guy was not having any of it he was driving off with it and is evidence of that he points to the fact that at least according these public filings he says two and a half years this company has never acknowledged any sort of dropped down fees which does sound\nUnusual that into in thousands of cars over a couple of year period there is not one\nBut in totally thousands of cars over a couple of year period there is not one person who took advantage of that that drop down than it does sound a little bit suspicious I don't know one way or the other re in Milwaukee radio WGM drink good afternoon\nGreat\nOkay let's try tied in Brookfield Hi Todd\nHey how you doing ... to ... I hate to break ranks with the violators here but from the standpoint of a property owner\nYou're a couple of things you said just doesn't make sense I mean first start going back to having the precursor to circuits you've already to find the fact that the police are not available to do that the second thing you're also called an anti consumer with regard to this current practice for consumers are the individuals that are\nPaying the ten in the race or their customers are those are\nWell what about the last guy what about the guy who says I'm parked in my space my ... my my ticket has fallen off and they're all in my car way east okay\nThere are there is a vehicle there is a mechanism to provide protection for the cars that are justified to be there for ... fell off ... no idea same situation with ... I talked to my buddy's space yeah I'm sure apartment complex or is that\nThese these vehicles are being told because of an open ordered ... Carrillo truck right and they're given a list of arthritis vehicle any business has the capability cover tow truck operator okay or come mechanism\nThis particular vehicle is now walk right you recall it overnight parking on Milwaukee's street and why it otherwise if you're an average parking area overnight parking your total where\nYeah I understand that our coach so I'm going to visit an going to visit my mom my car is not the author writes car park in her parking space in my car gets tote All right thank you\nFor your work off you're not you're not authorize or you're not there legally correct\nI'm well I'm In my mother's a parking space or you didn't make it you you don't have a problem with that wouldn't\nBe identified either pardon me your your mom ran for the are it wouldn't be identified on the list either right yeah so there has to be some effort on the part of the individual who ... who owns that were controlled that space as a part of their tendency to basically said the author\nOr what about what about the same thing they call and making a complaint hey there's somebody in my parking space you can you\nThink about and not being ... think about the volume of people the park you legally overnight\nBut this is how it always used to be called on them and they have ... ... ... if it was only a ... I think we're now look I just disagree with you on this I understand it is frustrating for cars to be bailed you know to to be a band in somebody's spots\nAh but you don't have to wait you can donate however I like and you can just go to ... dot com and see all the pictures and see what it's going to look like and donate if you so choose um and what has drawn me to this project is that there are so many different facets there's so many different facets on that day\nPeople coming together of bad people doing extraordinary things that's a term that Gordon ... uses all the time ordinary people doing extraordinary things at a time when all of us were on ... D when all of us we're dealing with this tragedy\nAnd what's drawing me is that you're seen it happen again now you're seeing his family\nHelped push this effort to create this memorial and you're seeing ordinary people again do extraordinary things coming together to help this happened by offering a crane to help lift this right up in the air and offer money to offer services material\nEveryone in his village and beyond their coming together to help make this happen and it it's almost a microcosm of what we saw Seventeen years ago\nAnd this is also just really the first part of what it's going to be a much larger effort riding\nIt stays warm there's also going to be an aspect that will honor the U.S military and those who enlisted after nine eleven and and many who are no longer with us they will be honored uh there is also going to be a first responders peace to this with of course the firefighters and the police officers who gave their lives running into this building or standing post while the rest of us we're running out\nOf the building you will also see a ground zero yeah monument there where you're honoring those who worked there that day who went there and spent weeks and months some of them are no longer with us who breed the toxic air\nI and perhaps most importantly is the educational component every one of the phases will be an amphitheater for people to come and sit in here speakers addressed\nThe crowd whether it's a field trip and students are maybe it's hardly writers or maybe it's a a night program or adults can come and the idea is to remember him learn and educate and most importantly not to forget what happened on that day um it's really ... rather remarkable and I even go\nExcept for the Jeff thinking about this thing about like any a motorcycle groups that would drive through there on forty five I mean this is a fairly well use road in that area who could actually benefit the community by stopping at the shop stop it at the Piglet regularly right or the other shops in that area so it's really all competing\nUm and we're trying to raise forty thousand dollars by raising the beam and if you text the word cares C.

center for all their work\nIs well presenting this for us so yes it's a it's a big endeavor but I'm hoping we can get their outstanding Bill thanks so much for all you do it is a\nVery worthwhile cause All right President Trump in the news\nI'm with an interview he gave that supposed to be here in the next couple of days where he talks about wanting to end\nBirthright citizenship what is birthright citizenship well it\nIt ... the slang term for birthright citizenship is is anchor baby and now ... lots of groups become find that term to be offensive but the idea behind birthright citizenship is a simple and if you if someone is born in the United states\nRegardless of the nationality of the parents\nRegardless of whether the parents are in the country illegally or not if you are born inside the United states you are a citizen of the United states\nAll right so that the term anchor baby which I understand is is slang and some people are offended by that he is the argument is is that the child okay so let's say you have to people who are in the country illegally from wherever\nThey have a child that child is now a U.S citizen\nThat child becomes the anchor making it more difficult to the poor mom or dad because the child is is in the country legally and therefore the child is a citizen now we're just birthright citizenship come from it actually\n... if the if you look at the fourteenth amendment to the U.S constitution\nIt sets all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states ended up the state where they reside that is the fourteenth amendment\nWhen that amendment was passed\nIt really had nothing to do with people coming into this country illegally or were legally what it was meant to do and this amendment goes back to post civil war days and the amendment was intended to make clear\nThat a black person was a citizen\nSo no argument at all but you know ... if you were if you were a slave in in Eighteen fifty and the slaves had been freed okay well what is their legal status this amendment was intended to make clear that in the demise of slavery\nEverybody is a citizen so it doesn't matter if you were born as a slave or as you were born as a quote unquote free person or whatever you are a citizen that was that was the real purpose behind the fourteenth amendment but\nBut over the years it has been used and now is most commonly viewed as as a way of somebody who is in this country illegally you have a baby and that child is now a citizen so in any event President Trump comes in and he's now saying I I I think we need to end birthright citizenship\n[noise] there are other countries including Canada that they have this I Would say the majority of developed countries\nThat they have this I Would say the majority of developed countries don't um the majority of developed countries merely by virtue of the fact that you are born in that country doesn't mean that you are a citizen of that country your citizenship of course depends on you know you're the nationalities have your mom and dad\nPresident Trump in his interview says we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially citizens of the United states for eighty five years with all those benefits it's ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to again he is not right that we are the only country but we\nWe we are one of the few countries I think that has that\nAnd president says President Trump says this is important to change this\nBecause we we want to discourage people from coming into this country illegally and birthright citizenship is one of those things that have come into this country illegally have the child and it's going to be more difficult to deport you that is what the argument is\nAll right for one for seven nine nine one six one that is the accident mortgage talk an excellent\nPresident Trump is suggesting he can end this practice with an executive order\nI think he's wrong I think\nAt minimum you would need a change in the law and you might need a change in the constitution because again of the fourteenth amendment he says he could do it by executive order I don't think he's right I I think it's a much more\nComplicated process but let's not talk about the process let's not talk about whether President Trump could end it like he says by the executive order let's talk about the concept is birthright citizenship again something that was\nReally designed initially to make clear that\nSlaves people who were born into slavery were in fact citizens\nIs birthright citizenship ... ships something that we should continue to have\nIn this country in twenty Eighteen whereby if you're born in the United states you are automatically citizen regardless of the legal status or the nationality of your parents for one for seven nine nine one six twenty is it time to end birthright citizenship\nWe'll discuss in just a moment if you're on the line please hold on its twelfth forty eight track record double duty I'm Jay\nNo one likes being stuck in a lawsuit got yeah you ought to

zone and he's tackled around the twenty yard line he's carrying the ball like a loaf of bread they knock it out he fumbled and the rams end up running out the clock\nHi good afternoon Jeff I'm like yeah I and my thoughts are bad enough to get caught or my job a basically your when I'm On outrage making her own call disregard the coach of the court and when I think it's probably a lot of guys they want with it was a coach well\nYou know that's it and the truth is I'm In in the NFL and in the NBA as well and in baseball as well perhaps\nSometimes you've got you've ... you've got different standards for different players okay Aaron Rodgers my guess is Aaron Rodgers and and uh Mike mccarthy have a kind of different relationship and Aaron Rodgers perhaps might follow inch not follow instructions all the way but he's Aaron Rodgers\nAnd ... you may be the reality is like it or not sometimes you have to make allowances for the superstars time Montgomery in a superstar he's just not\nRight\n[noise] yeah no they called me and that and I mean it it's just not by I guess from the perspective of trying to keep\nThe locker room how how can\nYou not send the message by getting rid of somebody who again is look I I Can't play pro football but I mean who who in the overall scheme of things\nI I'm an average sort of player I mean yes he he's a quality NFL player but he's an average player is not like he's one of the top ten or Fifteen players on on the team but I think again the larger issue is\nFrom the perspective of the coach if you keep a player like this\nYou know who's violating direct instructions if that is in fact what happened well then how do you how do you keep the trust of of a locker room and and forget about the context of football I mean imagine again in a work context you're the boss you give your sales force\nInstruction this is how we're going to do something and one of the sales people says well screw you boss I Know better I'm going to do with my own way and then it ends up costing the account how can you how can you just ignore that Tony in sling or Tony you're on WGM Jake good afternoon\n[noise] right yeah so I was listening to a\nTimeline gum raised earlier press conferences and for what he made it sound like it's made a judgment call based on whether or not he was going to be in the end of don't eat enough his knee and that would be on the goal line to get out now as far as letting them go\nAnd it out first of emotion that's obviously poison for team but when you keep a guy like that\nBecause it your players that were going to get into that and then no matter if you make a judgment call mistake your rent is ... ... ... and I I'm a little bit of an optimist so I think it'd be a great thing it could turn into a great story\nBut what about if the players don't believe that I mean I understand that's his story in his justification but if you were told\nTo just let the ball go um and and you don't let the ball go\nRight yeah and they obviously going to let it drop and I could probably would have found and the yeah yeah if you buy in there\nThat the judgment call they're all in Iraq right now I'm not there I Can't like write act like I Know better but if it wasn't on it but steak I think they they should act like him\nA pet nights ago I guess I don't I mean if if my coach tells me and he was in the end zone I mean so\nIt's either bad judgments um or or just ... or I mean I I don't know I don't know what an honest mistake is I mean if if if the boss instructs you to do something things a certain way and you decide that I I'm not going to do it that way\nI I guess yeah you can say well I made a mistake it was and I I heard him he said well I you know I got it and I was in the end zone but I wasn't sure and so I but but the bottom line is you've been told\nYou you've been told not to bring it out of the end zone so why why don't you line up three yards deep or something and then not have this issue I mean I think\nA lot of people at least in the team believe that he just didn't like being pulled from the game and he was going to bring it back but but regardless the consequences are so great and if you decide that he he really did disobey a direct order\nHow how can you not you know get get rid of him or let's talk to Aaron on this outside area a WTO O. J.\nI got a lot of people don't understand that don't follow football closely as well I think you're going to do today they have until three thirty pm central time\nTo trade him onto the trade deadline right in the last day to trade and you've got to be thirty so I think what they're trying to do now they're trying to cut you off in ... and if they can't be on and maybe they cut them I don't know actually what's gonna happen but I think they're trying to deal and maybe get a fixer seventh round draft\nRight and then and again if they'd cut him yesterday he he goes on waivers for so they don't get anything for him you know it was a trade like you're talking about but also he goes on waivers and you can see a guy like Bill Belichick swooping in picking him up just for the weekend to pick his brain on Packers plays or something like that in advance of next week\nOr do you think let me ask you this do you think he's on the team next week no no\nI I think I agree I I I think I think something's got to happen right and I guess I hadn't really thought about the upcoming trade deadline and the fact that they're playing New England next week which would be a basis for again keeping a couple of days but I I think I think McCarthy\nJust ... at some point in time you have to do these things and you know if you look at life in the NFL sometimes there there's talented players that ended in layers quite candidly a lot more talented time Montgomery\nThat get let go because you know that they couldn't follow instructions or or whatever and it also sounds like Montgomery becoming a distraction if you've got players and coaches\nI don't know it was just it was kind of it was a cool store\n... and you'd walk in there and it had everything\nFrom pocket knives to\nMilitary apparel fatigue jackets were big at the time you could buy a T jacket this this this Army Navy surplus store\nJust had everything I didn't smoke and I remember that cigarette lighters they just said rows and rows of cigarette lighters I never bought one but they kind of look cool because they had these different things on it just is store had just absolutely everything in it\nAnd again just like I could kill all this time in in the book store we we we kill all sorts of time in the Army Navy story I'm sure there's stuff I don't remember buying anything there but I'm sure there's stuff my friend's boughten all just because it had like\nLike everything in ... had this kind of most of the stuff had a military theme but not necessarily so why am I tell you about that this Army Navy surplus store well because\nThat Army Navy surplus store is still there\nIt's still there that same Army Navy surplus store that I use to patronize riding down on a Saturday afternoon on the bus is still there\nBut but not for long Journal Sentinel has the story today the again this is a place it's been there\nFor more than fifty years of Journal Sentinel story says it sells military gear like the tea jackets\nGrenade pouches meals ready to eat that's been selling all these things\nAnd now it is apparently closing there's a sign up on the door that says everything must go and according the journal sentinel they say everything inside is five dollars cash only and the the owner was working at the counter you know didn't say anything other than the fact that it's going to close\nBut this was this was something that was there for fifty years in stores common stores go\nAnd I I I Know I mean I went to market law school I mean I drive up and down Wisconsin Avenue a lot that I always see this Army Navy surplus store and I always keep thinking that it's amazing that this store has been there for all these years but it's not I mean it it is now going away is going the way of Boston Store\nAnd it's going the way of north ridge it's going the way of so many other places and I mean I I I get it I'm kind of amazed that it was able to to stay in business for for fifty plus years but it is it is a part of my childhood\nBecause as I was thinking about it after seeing the story I mean I'm having all these vivid recollections of my friends and I writing down to the bus and walking up Wisconsin Avenue in a couple of those friends are still here a couple of passed away and I'm thinking like I said another part of my childhood and end end it's closing\nSo I wanted to move away from the politics of the day and all the relentlessly bad news and things have been going on for a couple of days and I I I did it in recognition\nOf this store\nThat was a place that I used to patronize a long time ago finally saying okay we're we're we're throwing in the towel in closing I wanted to take a walk down memory lane open up the phone lines are number for one for seven nine once it twenty that's he acted mortgage talk and text line we do this from time to time\nSomething that you really miss a up and maybe it was from your childhood maybe it was from your adolescence maybe it was from your young adulthood um I I don't know but but something that you used to really like doing a place you used to really like going to store or restaurant or whatever\nThat you went to a lot that does now closed\nThat ... you'd never thought would necessarily closed but now it's gone\nGone but not for ... for one for seven nine nine one six twenty the jacket mortgage talking text line and my guess is replaces been in business in downtown Milwaukee for fifty years this Army Navy store is going to be one that fits that category\nGone but not forgotten what's your place for one for seven nine nine

looks really interesting now well of course if they had to move so this becomes an interesting\nInteresting move because if you pay are too young to safety is I'm Talking about an hour after Johnny

role\nBut again is that a force fit I don't think the Packers are better at safety because of the trade they made today I don't think so at all I don't think it's even close case in into so during the ...\nI think that was a terrible trade\nAnd like you said their second and their back and it's just terrible terrible I think the Montgomery trade with comment but you know a trade I Would love to see them make it a label on bell trade could you imagine what he would have been on the actors and\nEven if they only got 'em for one year one year you only got windows so but what what we're back to back

to see I I thought maybe just maybe\nRaiders my part with blue serving today I thought that might be interesting move for the Packers but I Can't look at the Packers roster right now and say yeah they made to trades and they're better\nOr they'd be suitable replacement for time Montgomery and the kickoff returning world and certainly a running back where Montgomery it was kind of third fiddle anyway but I don't think the better of safety regardless of what they do this year they're not better at safety right now they're not\nThey're just not so I'll be curious to see how they move forward\nWith the guys if they have no you may have to force fit some pieces here but the Bruins becomes kind of an interesting guy I think in that role\nI get back to the Packers discussion era Nagwa
