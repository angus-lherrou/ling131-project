J. good afternoon\nLike yes ma'am\n[laughter]\nShut up when\nHe thinks it's OK mhm ever see like if you wait wait wait don't I\nDon't know I I guess what you're\nPaying ... well I mean I understand people that look we're never\nNobody's going to be satisfied by this that that's why I said earlier this week that the the easiest thing to do I guess it'd be for the Senate to vote Brett Kavanaugh down and then somebody else to put up now I Would not do that because I I I've tried to make this argument as best I can\nI I don't know if you have somebody who is otherwise eminently qualified and Brett Kavanaugh like yes\nI I don't think you can deny them a position based on\nA completely and totally uncorroborated unsupported allegations\nFrom thirty five or thirty six years ago that's why I have no problem with the FBI investigation I I just I just don't think that you can do that and and I think we've gotten into the silly season as we talked about yesterday gee now we we don't like his temperament because he might have been at Yale and got into a disagreement got into an altercation at some bar will\nLike people were saying yesterday that Tuesday night and Madison ... I I think you know we've gotten into silly season I Would vote for Brett Kavanaugh simply because I think he's qualified and I don't think you can deny him I don't think it's right to deny him\nBased on an supported uncorroborated allegations and and I say that I don't know what the truth is I don't know what if anything happened between them I Do think\nThis is a situation where on the one hand maybe you argue the President Trump's felt to conduct Brett Kavanaugh needed defending I Would argue that the tide was starting to turn\nThat um you know the FBI investigation was under way I don't think that's going to determine anything that there was more stuff that we're starting to come out a little bit of an under the radar\nComing out about about some of\nYou know the the allegations and inconsistencies in Dr Ford statement and things like that I I think Kevin always winning I I Do and by President Trump\nMixing it up again I think he's made it tougher for at least some of the senators to vote for him but maybe he didn't care about that I mean clearly his audience wanted to see him to stand judge Kavanaugh\nLet's talk to Dan and find elect the Enron there'll be team Jay\nAnd they don't take my car or um want to talk about that is what people talk about around the water cooler\nYou know we do say that that girl had no merit even bring their fell back and you know ...\n'cause I think he ... when a lot of people are saying\nTrump took the top on a new thing\nSaid there's no merit in other words if she didn't know and he was locked yup yup\nSo in other words what I'm trying to get at on that is trying to just move on I mean we keep jumping to the next patient keep getting your hair and then you take that next step taking care of and move on and move forward so you know actually\nCarrying a gun come in and then we can\nMonitor and pressure or we're going to take care of next\nWe'll we'll take a call to and I guess my my my concern was I think things were going pretty well for capital I I I Do and I I my concern was by by President Trump's\nDoing what he did yesterday he he's now he's again he's kind of changed the narratives\nAnd now we're we're talking about are we we've you know reintroduced this and we're you know if if you vote for judge Kavanaugh are you supporting you know a president who mocks women or things like that I I don't know I guess I'd be curious to get into the president's psyche 'cause I I don't know\nIf he's trying to do this is part of a of some sort of master plan or rather whether this is just kind of off the cuff type of stuff it is one of the reasons why I Am\nSo intrigued as I said to forty this afternoon were scheduled to do an interview with a woman named ... who is the White House strategic communications director and we'll be talking about the Brett Kavanaugh situation so stick around for that is around two forty this afternoon it's twelve fifty a track record WTO O. J. [noise]\nOne\nOh nine WGM we actually much stuff going on here that leave your your cell phones while bugs within the next\nWhat Eric about seven or eight minutes if one Eighteen and be exactly one eighty okay and then immediately after that I have my producer saying\nRemembers it we have one of those national E. S. S. like if one Eighteen one twenty now the problem with him telling me that is it's just remember as if I ever knew how to have any advice that I ever knew so your your cell phones are going to be going off your we're going to be doing that ... E S e A. S.\nThing where it it sounds like the noises coming from somebody else shouting into a tin can or something like that but\nThat is all coming up in a couple of minutes you've got a ... on a minor version heck breaking loose on north avenue now here here's the story\nBrothers and sisters listen to me I come this way but once you have a group of the union organizers who have been pushing for minimum wage is a Fifteen dollars in the fast food industry\nDoes it matter that the job is only worth nine or ten or eleven dollars that they want Fifteen dollars doesn't matter\nThat if you start making fast food restaurants pay Fifteen dollars an hour\nWhat is going to happen is those fast food restaurants are going to get rid of people and they're going to go the automation is that it's going to cost jobs\nAnd it doesn't matter to these people but again the job just isn't worth Fifteen dollars an hour I mean I'm all in favor of everybody making as much money as they possibly can but the truth is you know your your job is only worth what your job is not these artificial sort of amounts so there's been these organized demonstrations again these\nIn many cases they are people that are are paid by the u._s.\nNot these artificial sort of amounts so there's been these organized demonstrations in getting these in many cases they are people that are are paid by the unions to to show up so what they do is they show up outside the McDonald's on ninth and north avenue\nMaybe you've seen if you ever get off the freeway or get on the freeway by by north avenue it's time in that area they show up\nAnd I used to just say well I don't necessarily analyze it it's just it's it is kind of what it is and and it's it's it how it's how it works and\nPeople disagree about stuff all the time and you can and I understand that maybe politics is more important than baseball but cubs fans I I'm sure it can be married to you know to um brewers fans maybe maybe even Packers fans can be married the bears fans that might be a tougher stretch but but I don't know\nBut in any event I thought this was worth at least one segment of conversation especially since\nWe are in there I I hate to I I hate to push it because we've always been politically polarized that's just the reality but I think you can make an argument that were perhaps as politically polarized now as we ever have been but but here is is my question for one for\nSeven nine nine which ... which is the accident mortgage\nTalk and text line All right Ken political opposites attract\nYou know we know it works for James Carville and Mary Madeleine but you know could you be involved in a relationship with somebody whose politics are completely and totally different from yours [noise]\nW ... interesting story in the front page of the journal says I'll say that they find the house and there's [noise]\nYard signs half the yard has public in the yard signs half the yard signs are are Democrats thinks it's kind of interesting and they go and they knock on the door and they talk to our ten Barbara and art is\nA parts of Republican Barbara's a flaming liberal Democrats she says I got stress in my life it's called Trump and Walker\nBarb says art has become more conservative overtime he wears this damn read captive says make America great again my son got it for him as a joke but now he wears it everywhere which I find to be very embarrassing\nUm so it just kind of like one of those those things and I I I understand that you know politics are polarizing nowadays and you read these polls that say that you know one out of five people or whatever and said that\nThey've stopped talking to somebody because of the disagreements in politics which raises a question given how wrapped up everybody is\nCan you be involved in a significant relationship can you have a significant other who has a different political world views and you\nThere's a text us from Christian Campbell sport my girlfriend's political views are completely different from mine it never comes between us and our relationship\nWe are simply very happy to be together is another one my wife and I don't agree on much in politics and social issues but we make it work\nBecause we're educated adults who can agree to disagree it blows my mind that other people cannot do the\nSame I'm Ari let's talk to Michelle in graft and Michelle good afternoon [laughter]\nI go out and I and I know [laughter] angry and it was actually you know so I actually\nTeach that not erotic hit it right broken and [laughter] [laughter]\nWell that's right\nDown on it and you know what they were talking about weight\nSo it kind of intimate dinner it was interesting dinner table Congress every\n[laughter] [laughter] thanks for the common which I guess I I\nI think the you you see this a lot and I think I I've always kind of said this to people\nPolitics\nAre are important but there there's no question about it but as a general rule that the sun is going to rise in in the east tomorrow I mean there there's you you you get involved you care you support your candidates you think that there's one world view that's better than another you think that there's going to be you\nKnow some policies that are going to affect you that are going to be better than other policies that will be but it as as a general rule and I've always made this argument most of us\nGo about our daily lives and you go to work and you come home at night and you turn on the ball game and you you we we all at the end of the day I I think one of the same sort of things and reasonable people I think can disagree about stuff\nEvery now and then you get people who on one side or another aren't necessarily reasonable and are just kind of just way off the bend on something and then I think the question just becomes bell\nI'm ... is there enough of another foundation do you have or your friends do you have enough of their interest I mean if you were and I I Will tell you I mean that the James Carville Mary mad one thing I never quite got that because it seemed to me that politics was their whole life and\nIf that was it that then all you're doing this fighting but I think for most people\nYou know politics is a part of your life and those are the discussions and that's your world view but you're going to disagree on that stuff but who's going to be a lot of other things that you agree on my gas here is that even in today's very very contentious political world there's there's\nA lot of people out there who find that their spouses don't necessarily agree with them on all sorts of stuff and might not agree with them on a lot of stuff but they're still happily married and they're raising their kids and they're getting on with their life and that's that's the way I think at the end of the day that it should be All right when we come back\nFor years and years one of the driving your shoes in Wisconsin has been the level of taxes that we pay do we care about taxes anymore stick around one forty F Wagner WGM Jay [noise]\nForty four or ... radio presents\nThe hometown call at for oh it is a viewing party tomorrow game one of the national league division series this free event will feature a massive movie screen broadcast at the ... ballroom\nTurner halls of course right across the street from the Bradley Center the Turner hall ball rooms where for the last several years we've done our Christmas event\nUm they're going to feature a broadcast game one of the national league division series between the brewers and the Colorado Rockies but here's what's really cool it's going to be sink to hall of famer ... play by play broadcast on WGM Jay radio and the associated bank brewers radio network\nDoors open at three o'clock this Thursday first pitch is at four o'clock\nI'm and is can we just we just can't review this enough tomorrow my show is going to be originating in its entirety starting at noon from at Miller Park will be in our mobile broadcast facility right outside of the front of Miller Park\nIf you are there stop by and say Hi we're going to do some regular program are going to have some brewers related programming than at three o'clock I'm going to turn it over the great Matt sick he'll do about a half hour of pre game unofficial pre game and then our official brigade broadcast starts around three thirty first pitches at four O. seven\nParking lots of open up to three hours before the game that is the schedule so they're scheduled to open up at one o'clock gates open up two and a half hours before the first pitch\nSo what about one thirty ish or so and the brewers that the game is sold out\nThey are expecting somewhere north of forty five thousand people so with the brewers are doing is just saying if and and it's good advice let me think back to opening day they're saying if you're coming out come out early um they're encouraging people once they get there in that same don't tailgate 'cause everyone's tailgate believe yourself enough time\nTo get into the stadium early there's going to be security lines and things like that they've got a lot of stuff going on before the game and they'd like people in their seats a little bit early to see some of the stuff that's going to be going on on the field so it's going to be a lot of fun\nAnd want to get out there but when you get out there if you wait till the last minute sometimes what happens is you get caught in those security lines and you'd like to try to avoid that anyhow it's going to be a very very big day tomorrow and if you are going out to Miller Park gum and you're coming in past our tailgate or be sure to stop\nOff and say Hi I Would like that quite a bit All right in some respects Scott Walker\nThe governor of the state is a victim of his own success\nPeople I think forget\nWhat it was a lake in Wisconsin in two thousand hand as as Jim Doyle term was winding down we had high unemployment and I don't I don't even further\nIn two thousand ten as as Jim Doyle term was winding down\nWe had high unemployment and I don't I don't even for the sake of this discussion I don't want to get into who do we blame for the high unemployment and things like that but we had enormously ridiculous levels of taxes we had high unemployment we had a an economy that was struggling\nAnd now eight years later that has completely and totally turned around\nA centrally we we are really almost that full employment bottom line is that anybody in Wisconsin who wants to job can pretty much get a job not might not exactly be the job they want\nBut you know we are pretty much at essentially full employment the unemployment levels very very close to what they called structural unemployment which is just you know people who are taking a couple of months off or you're between jobs or whatever but it but it basically anybody who wants to drop can get one\nAfter years and years of taxation through the roof levels of taxes have kind of stabilized despite a lot of the gloom and doom\nOne of our listeners from Illinois sends me tax HGF\nIf roads are really the biggest issue in Wisconsin life must be pretty darn good try living in Illinois with enormously high taxes and billions of\nDollars in debt yeah just just just say I mean historically\nYou know going back remember when Bill Clinton first ran for president his message was it's the economy stupid that that people vote their their pocket books you know people people want to see their lives improved that it's all about the economy this election\nIs is kind of turning that whole fought on on its head and I guess we'll see how that all plays off\nPlace out because clearly in Wisconsin\nIf you're voting the economy if if you're concerned about economic issues and job growth\nThere there's absolutely no reason at all not to vote for Governor Walker but if you believe the polls and that's a big if he's in the political race was like All right I Want to switch gears the\nThe New York times yesterday came out with a a ...\nPiece I don't know that I have ever seen anything like it on on President Trump and of course it's been picked up by by all the major news outlets I have this in my hands and as a matter of fact I it it's well if you print it out\nIt's thirty eight page it ... it's thirty eight pages was the last time you saw a newspaper article that was thirty eight page\nBooks are written that are smaller than thirty eight eight pages it's apparently going to be the subject of a ... the New York times was so over the moon with is that they cut a deal with Showtime and Showtime is apparently it's on this documentary on the New York times researching the story that that that they ran\nI have read the entire story\nAnd I read it twice because I wanted to make sure I understood that so I did it so you don't have to if you don't want to special investigation Trump engaged in suspects tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father\nRight now let me tell you what I'm going to take a quick break and then when we come back I Want to go through the story briefly and then we're going to open up the phone lines and we're going to discuss\nWhether or not you care stick around to twelve director WTO O. J. [noise] to\nAsia ... radio presenter [noise] hometown call it for home viewing party for game one of the national league division series tomorrow is free event will feature a massive movie screen broadcast the\nTurner halls ballroom of gain one or the national league division series between the brewers and the Rockies it's going to be sick to hall of famer Bob ... play by play broadcast on WGM Jay radio and the associated bank brewers radio network doors open at three o'clock this Thursday first pitch is at four\nO'clock All right at some point in time\nYou and your spouse might might actually sit down with an estate planning lawyer\n[noise] and you might discuss what you want to do with your stuff\nI'm One of the things if if you've got kids and you've got you're worried about okay our assets going to be divided the your state planning lawyer sit down we'll talk to you about a will perhaps\nYou know what happens if you you're both you and your spouse\nGod Forbid die in a car crash or something like that you know how how how or your assets gonna be divided what's gonna happen\nChances are the lawyer that you talked to will also start talking to you about something called an estate plan\nRight you know something beyond beyond will know what what do you want to do with your money is there a way that you can take stuff that you've worked for your entire lifetime and you can get it to your kids or you can get it I don't know to whoever charities or you can get it where you want to go\nWithout necessarily having to go the will Ralph there there is you know so you can avoid going to probate court because\nYou know you want to avoid broke but most people will tell you want to avoid probate court if you can't the lawyer who's doing your state plan we'll also talk to you about taxes\nAnd all these different strategies that exist because let's face it most people I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to devise plans to if it's possible avoid\nPaying taxes or avoid paying higher levels of taxes I'm not saying it vague I'm not saying commit crimes but there's all these different strategies are out there she if you do this with your money or you do that with it you're going to be able to avoid this or that or the other thing and you're going to\nYou know save your ears money right that's that's just what an estate planning lawyer will do and trust me there's all sorts of lawyers who make all sorts of money by putting together a state plans for people of all different levels of means that are again are designed to\nGet their money to where they want their money to go with\nTheir ears having to pay the least in taxes on it that that there's nothing wrong with that at all so any New York times comes out with this lengthy breathless story and what it what it essentially sense is that Donald Trump\nBorn with a silver spoon in in his mouth his his father was a builder Fred Trump and his father was a builder and a real estate guy who made a lot of money and who set up all these different\nPlans and programs et cetera to get his money to his kids\nWithout again having to pay taxes or as much taxes as possible on it\nNow this I guess somewhat contradicts forget subway this contradicts there's a story that Donald Trump tells about how he sort of a self made man and he started out with the\nMillion dollar loan that he repaid from his father and dumped the New York times story says well it really wasn't wasn't that actually any loans he took world were a lot more but the Trump grew up\nI Know it's a sign of this really rich builder and benefited a lot from that and then the story goes on to talk about how as his father got older\nHow they had that the corporations and the father had all these different plans if they developed to try to get money to the kids with the smallest hack impact possible right now the Trump Organization say that you know every year\nEvery year when they did this it was reviewed by the IRS it was reviewed by their lawyers and you know people signed off on this the New York times now goes back and says well you look at this and you look at that and you look at this and this this looks a little bit fishy and maybe they shouldn't have been able to do this and they should have paid more taxes on this but you know they're they're going back\nYou know they're going back decades on this and the idea being that I guess number one if President Trump says he was self made guy yeah he's probably not telling the truth he got\nHe got a head start that most people don't necessarily get namely that he you know he was was born into this this family that had this incredible well it goes on to say that some of the business deals he made weren't necessarily that good and that you know he was was hurting at the time of you\nKnow the the real estate crash back in in the eighties and the debt kind of bailed him out by doing stuff then it also says yeah they took advantage of all the different tracks strategies and they kind of push the line but transferring money from debt with various family members All right so that\nThat is a summary I think of the\n... transferring money from debt with various family members All right so that\nThat is a summary I think of the you know forty page story\nAnd of course it's getting all this attention the New York times has an editorial Donald Trump and the self made sham now he's he's not really a he's not really a self made man you know he inherited a lot of this money or for their parts of Trump Sawyer warns of New York times\nI'm of the you know some of the stuff that is the family story\nI I Want to talk about the the larger issue here\nI understand that President Trump is incredibly divisive I understand that there's almost no middle ground there that you either\nLove Donald Trump or you have Donald Trump I I get all that but I mean I I really I read the story kind of looking for the smoking gun and what you have it again his his father\nDied decades ago and what you have is a rich guy who\nPassed on his money to his kids Donald Trump President Trump was like the favorite one of the kids but\nYou know essentially from the moment these kids were born\nThey developed like these tax strategies to pass money on to the kids with the least tax impact possible and yes it's not it doesn't appear that Donald Trump is a self made man in the sense of I don't know Horatio Alger or somebody like that\nBut I guess I'm reading all this and I'm trying to figure out you know what what the new ground is here and whether anybody cares I mean I don't know about you but it doesn't come as a surprise to me that President Trump was born into a wealthy family and was able to\nTo present this allegation to Dan calling for an FBI investigation and basically put judge Kavanaugh's life on hold and this process on hold 'em for political purposes\nI'm pressing the after nominating church seven on was\nRelatively Louis we circumspect what was going on he was talking about the need for the I investigation indicating that you know ... but he used to be larger shovel yesterday at a rally in Mississippi you kind of way to do with the um [noise] some comments about the accuser\nResenting ensure ... look prisons thinking on that\nLook the president was simply stating fact that a lot of media outlets have not reported on um there are inconsistencies in Dr Ford testimony um you know while she\nWas in the air and her and her in in her testimony in our hearing and obviously I mean I you know if she has gone through a sexual assault situation I ate we're all very sympathetic towards that with that being said you look at what these special prosecutor who went and a myth Michel\n... who asked the questioning or to both Kavanaugh as well to a doctor Ford and what she represented and again she comes from a very neutral ground basically saying that\nThere is just not enough evidence in this situation and and watch and what Dr Ford presented\nThat there's basically a lot of inconsistencies in her story where she doesn't know what had happened what had happened and where it happened who took her home that day and and even those witnesses that Dr Ford had mentioned basically refuted her claim\nSo it is a situation where the emotional um basis of all of this is driving facts and that is very very problematic because we want to get to the facts obviously we of course feel for those who have gone through\nSexual assault I'm ... ... women who have gone through sexual assault mad as well\nBut we also at this case what's happening is we've got to separate that from the fact that there are facts in\nThe story and that is part of what the FBI is doing to\nTo basically um you know get the information that they need the background information that they made us so we're going to get through this process but with that being said what has been horrific is saying\nHow this has all played out it it it's become a circus it's really trying to destroy people's lives I Know Brett Kavanaugh personally I Know his wife his children I worked with Brett Kavanaugh on the Bush administration we worked very closely together he was always incredibly professional respectful to women to all\nAnd and really I Do Brett Kavanaugh we all know and love someone who is has had a stellar career not only in the executive branch but often the judicial branch where he is respected by legal experts on both sides and it's just so unfortunate that we've ended up\nThrowing away his style or career to focus on high school and yearbook and all this craziness that we're saying\nWe're talking or she left was the White House strategic communications director senator Cory Booker comes up today and he says well the White House should she ditch the cabinet nominations wizard he's innocent or guilty and I guess maybe that is the course of least resistance to that have any appeal to the White House\nLiterally not I mean we look at judge Kavanaugh's record and he has that he's going to be an independent judge\nHe has a very strong judicial record I mean over three hundred opinions rent and he's obviously served in the district ... circuit court of appeals which is the second highest court in the land he's gone through six FBI investigations\nDemand is more than beyond qualified there is no question in my mind about that what the Democrats are doing is that they obviously want to delay stall resist a destroy\nA as much as they can because they're\nThey're trying to bet on on the audit election [laughter] I mean they are very concerned of who takes this to this\nSupreme Court division right so for that for them this is an all or nothing approach and they're all approaches and an ambush\nAnd a character assassination attempt to basically try to take down whoever President Trump would affect whether it would have been Kavanaugh or not but I find this to be\nThe lowest I look I've been in Washington a for Twenty years and I've never in my lifetime seen this attempt by one party to absolutely destroy\nThese a judge I just I've never seen anything like that I mean you can take it back to the Clarence Thomas but I mean the the reality is is that they the Democrats are in a ... all or nothing campaign where they will near they were ambushed they will destroy whoever is going to\nTry to become ... Supreme Court justice happened three per capita\nThat kind of tied to the next question was going to be secure you look at it you think already this happens to judge Kavanaugh who in their right mind do you reach out to say here I I Want you to be the next justice of the Supreme Court knowing that you're going to get the treatment as well but\nYou're going to have stuff that you did in high school and grade school or whatever\nNow plastered and turned into your you're drunk or your sexual or whatever\nRight and you had senator Cory Booker actually admitting that he was groping girls back in high school or in college I mean it's like it goes to no end right to the Democrats have said okay we're going to not only you know go into this whole\nDo where they've they've accused him of being a rape or you know a race someone who is rape or they've accused him\nOf being a rapist I'm Sorry Dave accused him of you know being a trunk I mean these are serious accusations\nAnd false accusations and and yet new whatever like the liberal media could fine they would throw out there without even verifying\nUh their stories and then the Democrats would pile on by staying there is no presumption of innocence or guilt or like Senator senator heroin as sad about all men should just shut up I mean I have to tell you if I were like I don't understand how a senator Tammy Baldwin could just\nNot stand up against the Democrats on this for ... it is wrong the profits that they have pushed forward when it was Justice Sotomayor when it with Justice Kagan who by the way hired Brett Kavanaugh um to teach at Harvard these they it was a ... a respectful process\nAnd it's like the Democrats have lost their minds and are basically saying\nLet's let's do we we have to figure out a way to take him down and and I just think that the temperature has been raised so high here in Washington the stress level that you know the fact that you have even the senators who feel concerned Republican senators who are concerned for their safety because you have protesters who will will will\nStop them and get get\nAll right nice Republican senators who are concerned for their safety because you have protestors will will\nStop and get that get in their faces about these things and make it hard to gauge into that judge Kavanaugh it's just great pride I mean it's out and it's why\nMajority leader Mitch McConnell has said we are moving forward I didn't know we need to move forward on the profit for cannot keep waiting um because it's just been to Iran too painful for their families\nIf you look at your crystal ball was going to happen at the end of the week or are they going to be enough votes to confirm him\nYou know I'm hopeful that we couldn't get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed there's no one who I Know\nThat are who can that's wrong who is so incredibly qualified than a public servant for over Twenty years who have been somebody who has a\nVery much a well respected and illegal circles and will be an excellent addition to the court but sadly what we're going to see someone who is\nWho the Democrats have made it a point to destroy its reputation and that well how long lasting effect [noise] um ... and for I have to tell you it really is something I ... I'm In one of the most disgraceful process is I have seen\nIn Washington and the Democrats to to stop and and that's why I'm just so disappointed in and senator Tammy Baldwin for not\nJust standing up against the Democrats and that's a process that's so unfair and that would not only to a doctor but so unfair to judge Kavanaugh family\nA Mercedes I have one final question I have to ask you you you and your position report directly to the president what was it like working for President Trump\nYou know I'm I feel so honored and blast to not only worked for President Trump sit there for the American people are here in Washington DC obviously when you go into the west wing\nYou carry this great burden of those who are before you knew you recognize that it's a big big responsibility so I you know one thing about President Trump and I've worked for two presidents President George W.\nBush and now President Trump is that President Trump very result oriented he wants to keep pushing and driving and thinking and figuring out how we can\nThink outside of the box like comes to Washington\nObviously Congress very slow moving and though the president has been able to push things thrill I mean we had a huge victory this week with a renegotiation of NAFTA the U.S and the egg and added to the point of our biggest trade agreements that we've made and that is\nPaul Seventeen Jeff way you're WGM drink [noise]\n... several of the ... day I was laid off for a Fox tomorrow afternoon the question\nIs unlike in two thousand eight and two thousand eleven where I thought\nYou know ... us those of us who are brewers fan you wanted to see him go all the way you want to see in the world series go to the world series I think in our hearts parts we we knew that All right that they they weren't the best team in the national league and that they probably weren't going to win and it wasn't just sort of a disappointment when they did\nI think the issue here is different I\nDon't think there's any team in the national league it's actually better than the brewers especially the way they're playing now and while we are reveling in this season I think legitimately\nThis the team that has the ability to win the world series for one for seven nine nine one six twenty ... mortgage talk and text line right what do you think is this a team that really can seriously go all the way Tom and Greenfield Tom your first good afternoon [laughter]\nRight I think you got there in the beginning of the you know earlier this year\nAnd everything like hey man [laughter] and going and I think\nThere are some of these [laughter] come on [laughter] but\nMaybe it maybe\nWe're not as how I'm there Tom thanks for calling from your lips to God's Ears for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the acting it mortgage ... fine I mean I think you raise a couple of really interesting points first of all\nI mean you you look at the incredible yeah ... ... of of this team I mean\nThere's there's really not a weak spot in the team okay maybe you say is like a catcher could hit a little bit better but but beyond that I mean you know you talk about an outfield you talk about an infield is there any\nYou know group is starting players that you can put together that the team is perhaps better know you can say okay well we'd like to have you know more of the great starting pitchers okay but All right if I even if I give you that even if they don't have the ...\nWhat's the brewers have it is I think arguably the deepest and the best bullpen\nIn major league baseball and I'll tell ya there's not any there's not a team that wants to play the brewers if the brewers are head after five innings so if you get starting pitching that can rise the occasion to get past this and then you couple that with others I don't know a lot of potential here or let's go to let's see our Facebook Live page we\nAre going to go all the way Mike says now that the cubs are out the brewers are clearly the team to beat their easily the best team left to the national league while we shouldn't get arrogant or complacent then they'll believe me I'm not arguing that I think we can be confident that they are going to go far\nYeah that's that's the point that's out there um let's see Scott says I think they sweep Colorado and then um beat the I think they swoop Colorado and then beat the Braves or Brad says we will win the pennant the world series we'll be tough but then you need to they were the favorites in laws\nThis year they probably the underdogs but anything is possible especially\nBeing hot like they are you know I I I said this a lot but my friend Wayne Larrivee of course the voice of the Green Bay Packers he all he says and it's something that stuck with me but it's not necessarily who you play it's when you play them teams go through whether\nIt's a football team or basketball team or a baseball team there long seasons and teams go through different periods of time\nYou had the brewers before the all star break remember when they lost five games in a row in Pittsburgh and they were reaching the end of this point where they play twenty three games and twenty three days and they were kind of out of gas well All right you you wanted to play the brewers there you don't want to play the this brewers team now and\nThere's so much of I think sports like so much of life is just believing that you can do something and I think\nI think this team believes that they can do it and it's it's just this incredible feeling that you get ... and again I don't cover the team on a daily basis but every once in a while I have an opportunity to talk to\nBrewers management then you know once or twice a year you a chance to talk to a lot of the players and stuff and I I I think they genuinely like each other I think they believe in themselves and that's a huge part of the battle Andy in Beloit Andy or there'll be T. M. J. good afternoon\n[laughter] [laughter] really strongly [laughter]\nWell I guess it was [laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] maybe they maybe five or something I don't want to go there [laughter] oh\nWell I I think I mean I I'll tell you I mean starting in September I mean it's it's been the last month or so as they've rounded into place you know when when he went on that run where they\nThey won seven eight nine series in a row with the exception of uh the last two out of three to Pittsburgh one time it was when they started doing that that I started saying hey this this team now thanks to the teams for real and let's give David Stern some credit I mean it's\nYou know when when you went out and you pick up bike was stock is and um you you pick up ... Gonzalez and you know that the players that he's acquired I'm Curtis Granderson have have fit in incredibly well into the mix and\nI again they're just starting to come together and I mean I think it's kind of been a\n... a gradual thing I always thought that they had the talent to go far but now they're they're starting to you know deliver on that let's talk to Paul in Cedar pollen WTO O. J.\nO. Y. here right right but here's the other question who they are right now the ... that'll\nRight right here right\nNow the head that that'll be an interesting thing what do they have to have to announce that today or is it I'm not sure if say or tomorrow morning or whatever that is\nWhy they do they airing in animal but I don't know yet man [laughter] yeah oh\nYeah I don't think it'll it'll depend I think um my guess is they go for the first series which is the best the five and just the gas my guess is they go with free starting pitcher so um it'll be Gonzalez shot scene and Wade Miley Jack Davis my guess is he's out for the first um series\nI Would just say that I'm I'm trying to think I think would risk is probably in\nI think Domingo ... Cana is in\nAnd then it's sort of the core group but there's there's a lot of guys good contributors were going to be on the outside looking in but the the fun part of this is what you just what a great team and\nWhat a lot of potential I understand by early next week we could all be singing the blues saying oh we just didn't see that coming in and you have to understand that that's what baseball is you you know one team gets hot one team doesn't but I Will tell you\nFor those of us who have been long suffering Milwaukee Brewers fans I think now may very well be the time and I sit here in the studio and you can't see in our\nFacebook Live camera they look up and we've got these these numbers up there and it's it starts at eleven ten nine eight goes down but eleven is the number of wins that the brewers would need to get ... uh to win the world series and at first when I saw those numbers up there I thought okay maybe maybe this is an act of hubris and the part of\nManagement but to more and more I think about it I think not I mean anything can happen but I tell you I think it is going to be an absolutely great right and you can hear every pitch on WGM Jay starting tomorrow at four O. seven and I seriously I mean if you're coming out to Miller Park\nMy whole show originates from outside Miller Park in our mobile broadcast facility be sure to stop by and say hello I Would appreciate it twelve twenty eight track record WGM Jay [noise]\nWell thirty seven Jeff Wagner WGM she has he tried to take the high road on this because\nI said is four and I know that there's a number of people who are otherwise good and wonderful people who happened to be cubs fans who listen to this broadcast so I I and I have said and I stand by this individually I I think cubs fans can be the nicest sweetest best people in the world\nCollectively you get a lot tougher cubs fans together and you add in a dose of winning\nAnd they become very very difficult to be around so I I I was even I was a little bit sympathetic watching the brewers of course when on Monday and the brewers celebrated Wrigley Field and then last night\nThe cubs lose again at Wrigley Field and the Colorado Rockies celebrate I even I felt that couple twins is a little bit of regret for cubs fans but\nThen I remembered all the foul mouth the duchess behavior that I've sets written Miller Park for years and years and years and\nYeah\nI wasn't as quite as sympathetic okay the brewers are the Packers are giving fans plenty to cheer about lately but now it's time for your Milwaukee bus to get on the on the action as well I served four I'm finally opens its doors for what it was built for a basketball game coverage of the bucks in the bulls pre season opener starts this evening six thirty right here on\nNow work of fish oyster him and the the whole thing is is it got completely not again [laughter] but the major accomplishment granted ratify get but nonetheless you know it's a major accomplishment that you know you can start to raise that batter up and walk around with it and guess what you know media\nBut not a slam on that same way I'm Out of the fact that he's hiding somebody that you know that\nI did exist that alleges sexual assault yeah right ... right there they're not going to be writing in general terms about gee is this going to make it easy for easier for dairy farmers in central Wisconsin to sell their products to Canada\nWith they're going to be talking about is here you have the president who is insensitive to people who alleged victims of sexual assaults I I guess All right let's see more causing a cigarette conduct Yvonne and Milwaukee Yvonne you're diluting them good afternoon\nThank you ma'am\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] oh man I Can't\nEat pension mhm\nEver see like I Am waiting don't show on that chair hurt yourself\nI I get to\nHang on ... I mean I understand people that look we're never\nNobody is going to be satisfied by dissatisfied me I said earlier this week that the the easiest thing to do I guess it'd be for the Senate to vote for a cabinet down and then somebody else who put up now I Would not do that because I I tried to make this argument as best I can\nI I don't know if you have somebody who is otherwise eminently qualified and Brett Kavanaugh like yeah\nI I don't think you can deny them in a position based on\nGay completely and totally uncorroborated in unsupported allegations\nFrom thirty five or thirty six years ago that's why I have no problem with the FBI investigation I just I just don't think that you can do that and and I think we've gotten into the silly season as we talked about yesterday the now we we don't like his temperament because he might have been a gale and got into a a disagreement got into an altercation that if some bar will\nLike people were saying yes it is next Tuesday night and Madison ... I I think you'll have gotten into the silly season I Would vote for Brett Kavanaugh simply because I think he's qualified and I don't think you can deny him I don't think it's right to deny him\nBased on unsupported uncorroborated allegations since and I say that I don't know what the truth is I don't know what if anything happened between them I I Do think\nThis is a situation where on the one hand maybe you argue that President Trump's felt that could Brett Kavanaugh needed defending I Would argue that the tide was starting to turn\nThat um you know the FBI investigations underway I don't think that's going to determine anything that there was more stuff that we're starting to come out a little bit of it under the radar coming out about some of\nYou know the the allegations and inconsistencies in Dr Ford statement and things like that I think Kevin always leaning I I Do and by President Trump\nMixing it up again I think he's made it tougher for at least some of the senators to vote for him but maybe he didn't care about that I mean clearly his audience wanted to see him to stand judge Kavanaugh let's talk to Dan and find elect Daniel WTO O. J.\n... than my car or um want to talk about that is what people talk about or on the water cooler you know we you know ... that girl had no merit here and bring them back and\nKnow for a while ago\nBecause I think he ... with a lot of people are saying\nTrump took up on a new thing he said\nThere's no merit\nIn other words he said she didn't know you\nKnow he was talking yep yep\nSo in other words when I'm trying to get at on that is trying to move on I mean we keep jumping to the next station\nYou keep them\nTake care of them are like no I take that back next step taken care of and move on and move forward so you actually have it on on demand and then we can go next Russia or we're going to take care of next\nWhat was called in I guess my my main concern was I think things were going pretty well for capital I I I Do and I I my concern was by by President Trump's\nDoing what he did yesterday he he's now he's in he's kind of changed the narratives\nAnd now we're we're talking about are we we've you know reintroduced this and we're you know if if you vote for judge Kavanaugh are you supporting you know a president who mocks women or things like that I don't know I guess I'd be curious to get into the president's psyche 'cause I don't know\nIf he's trying to do this is part of a of some sort of master plan or rather whether this is just kind of off the cuff type stuff it is one of the reasons why I Am\nSo intrigued as I said to forty this afternoon were scheduled to do an interview with a woman named ... who is the White House strategic communications director and we'll be talking about the Brett Kavanaugh situation so stick around for that is around two forty this afternoon\nTeach it communications director and we'll be talking about the Brett Kavanaugh situation so stick around for that is around two forty this afternoon it's twelve fifty a track record WTO O. J. [laughter]\n\nOne\nOh nine for fresh WGM ... we have so much stuff going on here that the your your cell phone for all bugs with him and that's\nWhat Eric about seven or eight minutes one Eighteen and be a ... one eighty okay and then immediately after that I had my producer saying [noise]\nRemember that we have one of those national E. S. like one Eighteen one twenty out of the problem with him telling me that is it says remember as if I ever knew how to fly that I ever knew [laughter] you know so your your cell phones are going to be going off your\nWe're going to be doing that that annoying E. S. E. A. S. thing\nWhere it it sounds like the noises coming from somebody else shouting into they can can or something like that but that is all coming up in a couple of minutes you've got I'm On a minor version heck breaking loose on north avenue here here's the story\nBrothers and sisters listened to me I come this way but once you have a group of the union organizers who have been pushing for minimum wage is a Fifteen dollars in the fast food industry\nDoes it matter that the job is only worth nine or ten or eleven dollars that they want Fifteen dollars doesn't matter\nThat if you start making fast food restaurants pay Fifteen dollars an hour\nWhat he's going to happen is those fast food restaurants are going to get rid of people and they're going to go to automation is that it's going to cost jobs and it doesn't matter to these people but again the job just isn't worth Fifteen dollars an hour I mean I I'm all in favor of everybody making as much money as they possibly can\nBut the truth is you know your your job it is only worth what your job is\nNot these artificial sort of amounts so there's been these organized demonstrations in Guinea's\nIn many cases they are people that are are paid by the unions to to show up\nSo what they do is they show up outside the McDonald's on ninth and north avenue\nMaybe you've seen if you ever get off the freeway or get on the freeway by by north avenue it's kind of in that area they show up\nThe owner of the restaurant apparently knew they were coming and he he shut down\nSo the police get there you've got a handful that this was it a large protest by any weight may way shape or form but they just going on\nThe group shows up they try to block of fast food plane but the the restaurant owner already closed down in anticipation of WYSO the cops come they find that there's there's nothing to see here\nSo they said they they they get ready to leave\nTV cameras show up but of course that's what these protests are all about it's trying to get your face on TV she got a ragtag group of protesters that show up because they want the attention but there's nothing to see because the owner was kind of shut this down so already shut it down so ... to groups pandas as the officers and this is my understanding what happened\nThe officers say okay well there's there's nothing to see here All right we're we're we're leaving\nNope no problem so then in an effort to get attention they leave the McDonald's where they're doing the protest\nThey walk into the intersection and block the intersection at north avenue solely so they can get the police to arrest them so they can get some television coverage I mean seriously now now here's where I really come down on his brothers and sisters that again pay attention I come this way but once\nThe purpose of this is you have all these people who are supposedly out of were\nProtesting Fifteen dollars an hour that's what they want they want ... dollars an hour well All right I have a couple of questions here first of all I have have you people look for a job because when we just see what does it yesterday or two days ago Amazon\nAmazon is on a hiring binge Amazon has committed to paying Fifteen dollars an hour\nSo if you really want a job that pays Fifteen dollars an hour Amazon will hire you so why don't you get your sorry bucks get off the street and actually go work for a living that's number one All right number two is still looking for a job the\nUm so it just kind of like one of those those things and I I I understand that you know politics are polarizing nowadays and you read these polls\nThat say that you know one out of five people or whatever and said that\nYou know that they've stopped talking to somebody because of the disagreements in politics which raises a question given hell wrapped up everybody is can you be involved in a significant relationship and you have a significant other who has a different political world view than you\nThere's a text us from Christian Campbell sport my girlfriend's political views are completely different from mine it never comes between us and our relationship\nWe are simply very happy to be together is another one my wife and I don't agree on much in politics and social issues that we make it work\nBecause we're educated adults who can agree to disagree it blows my mind that other people cannot do the\nSame um marinades let's talk to Michelle in crafted Michele good afternoon\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know [laughter] angry and it was actually very educational [laughter] other\nThan that you want to get it right okay\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat's right\nDown there and you know what I cannot wait\nSo intimate dinner it was interesting dinner table con right\n[laughter] right right [laughter] next to the comic which I guess I I I think\nThat you see this a lot and I think ... I I've always kind of said this to people\nPolitics are are important that there there's no question about it but as a general rule\nThat the sun is going to rise in in the east tomorrow I mean there there's\nYou you you get involved you care you support your candidates you think that there's one world view this better than another you think that there's going to be you know some policies that are going to affect you that are going to be better than other policies that will be but it as as a general rule and I've always made this argument most of us\nGo about our daily lives and you go to work and you come home at night and you turn on the ball game and you you we we all at the end of the day I think one of the same sort of things and reasonable people I think can disagree about stuff\nEvery now and then you get people who on one side or another aren't necessarily reasonable and they're just kind of just way off the bend on something and then I think the question just becomes bell\nI'm ... is there enough of another foundation do you have or your friends do you have enough other interest I mean if you're in I I Will tell you I mean that the James Carville Mary mad one thing I never quite got that because it seemed to me that politics was their whole life and if that was it than than all you're doing this fighting\nBut I think for most people\nYou know politics is a part of your life and those are the discussions and that's your world view\nBut you're going to disagree on that stuff is going to be a lot of other things that you agree on\nMy gas here is that even in today's very very contentious political world there's there's a lot of people out there who find that their spouses don't necessarily agree with them on all sorts of stuff and might not agree with him on a lot of stuff but\nThey're still happily married and they're raising their kids and they're getting on with their life and that's that's the way I think at the end of the day that it should be All right when we come back\nFor years and years one of the driving issues in Wisconsin has been the level of taxes that we pay do we care about taxes anymore stick around one forty F Wagner double duty and Jay [noise]\nForty four WGM Jake company she and the radio presents\nThe hometown call at Pearl Harbor [noise] it is a viewing party tomorrow game one of the national league division series this free event will feature a massive movie screen broadcast at the\nBallroom Turner halls of course right across the street from the Bradley Center\nThe Turner hall ball rooms where for the last several years we've done our Christmas event\nUm they're going to feature a broadcast in game one of the national league division series between the brewers and the Colorado Rockies but here's what's really cool it's going to be sent to hall of famer Bob ... play by play broadcast on WGM Jay radio and the associated bank brewers radio network\nDoors open at three o'clock this Thursday first pitch is at four o'clock\nUm and it's getting we just we just can't review this enough tomorrow my show is going to be originating in it\nIt is at four o'clock um and it's getting we didn't we just can't review this enough tomorrow my show is going to be originating in its entirety starting at noon from at Miller Park will be in our mobile broadcast facility right outside of the front of Miller Park\nIf you are there stop by and say Hi we're going to do some regular program are going to have some brewers related programming than at three o'clock I'm going to turn it over to Greg Matt sick he'll do about a half hour of pre game unofficial pre game and then our official pregame broadcast starts around three thirty first pitches at four O. seven\nParking lots of open up to three hours before the game that is the schedule so they're scheduled to open up at one o'clock gates open up two and a half hours before the first pitch\nSo what about one thirty ish ... or so and the brewers that the game it's sold out\nThey are expecting somewhere north of forty five thousand people so with the brewers are doing is saying it and it and it's good advice and we think back to opening day they're saying if you're coming out come out early um they're encouraging people once they get there and I said don't tailgate 'cause everyone's tailgate to leave yourself enough time\nTo get into the stadium early there's going to be security lines and things like that they've got a lot of stuff going on before the game and they'd like people in their seats a little bit early to see some of the stuff that's going to be going on on the field so it's going to be a lot of fun they want to get out there but\nWhen you get out there if you wait till the last minute sometimes what happens is you get caught in those security lines and you'd like to try to avoid that anyhow it's going to be a very very big day tomorrow and if you are going out to Miller Park gum and you're coming in\nPast our tailgate or be sure to stop off and say Hi I Would like that quite a bit\nAll right in some respects Scott Walker\nThe governor of the state is a victim of his own success\nPeople I think forget\nWhat it was a lake in Wisconsin in two thousand ten ... as as Jim Doyle term was winding down\nWe had high unemployment and I don't I don't even for the sake of this discussion I don't want to get into who do we blame for the high unemployment and things like that but we had enormously ridiculous levels of taxes we had high unemployment we had a an economy that was struggling\nAnd now eight years later that has completely and totally turned around\nA centrally we we are really almost that full employment bottom line is that anybody in Wisconsin who wants to job can pretty much get a job not might not exactly be the job they want\nBut you know we are pretty much at a centrally full employment the unemployment levels very very close to what they called structural unemployment which is just you know people who are taking a couple of months off or you're between jobs or whatever but if they're basically anybody who wants to drop can get one\nAfter years and years of taxation through the roof levels of taxes have kind of stabilized despite a lot of the gloom and doom when Governor Walker ruled out act and oh\nThis is going to destroy it's going to destroy the public sector that that hasn't been the case it it just has not I'm not saying there's some public sector employees who don't like act can and don't like the fact that they have to contribute a little bit towards their health care and contribute more to the pension plans I get all that\nBut you you have not seen public services that are completely and totally destroyed in this state\nYou have an economy is booming and from an employment perspective\nThe biggest challenge now is it can cause somebody to get a job but it's for employers can you find people to do the jobs you know there's been an almost a revolution when it comes to hiring and economic status and things like that over the last eight years to the point that I think people now again forget\nForget what it was like when there really were kind of hard times so 'cause things are going actually so well but that in some respects works against Governor Walker because for people forget what it was like in two thousand ten so now it's like well\nAll right uh yeah I I Know I I Know that the taxes are low but you know boy there there's there's potholes bits at the end of the streets and so it's set of worried about whether you're gonna lose your job and if you if you're not worried about you that that pothole hasn't been fixed for a while and I'm not saying that the bottle shouldn't be fixed but it it shows how people's\nThinking changes\nIn this campaign one of the things that has not broken through yet I I don't think people are necessarily concentrating on right now is that walkers challenger Tony ... he's very very good at being non specific but if you listen to him it's one of the standard liberal pay less\nI have read the entire story\nAnd I've read it twice because I wanted to make sure I understood this so I did it so you don't have to if you don't want to special investigation Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father\nRight now let me tell you what I'm going to take a quick break and then when we come back I Want to go through this story briefly and then we're going to open up the phone lines and we're going to discuss whether or not you care stick around to twelve ...\n[noise]

about taxes\nAnd all these different strategies that exist because let's face it\nMost people I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to devise plans to if it's possible\nAvoid paying taxes or avoid paying higher levels of taxes I'm not saying ... I'm not saying commit crimes but there's all these different strategies are out there she if you do this what's your money or you do that with it you're going to be able to avoid this or that or the other thing and you're going to\nYou know saved your ears money right that's that's just what an estate planning lawyer will do and trust me there's all sorts of lawyers who make all sorts of money by\nPutting together a steak plans for people of all different levels of means that are again are designed to get their money to where they want their money to go\nTheir ears having to pay the least in taxes on it that that there's nothing wrong with that at all so any New York times comes out with this lengthy breathless story and what it what is essentially sense is that Donald Trump\nWas born with a silver spoon in in his mouth his his father was a builder Fred Trump\nAnd his father was a builder and a real estate guy who made a lot of money and who set up all these different plans and programs et cetera to get his money to his kids\nWithout again having to pay taxes are much taxes as possible on it now this I guess somewhat contradict\nIt's without again\nHaving to pay taxes or as much taxes as possible on it\nNow this I guess somewhat contradicts free at subway this contradicts that the story that Donald Trump tells about how he sort of a self made man and he started out with the\nMillion dollar loan that he repaid from his father and jumped the New York times story says well really wasn't wasn't that they actually any loans he took world were a lot more but the Trump grew up\nUh you know like the son of this really rich builder and benefited a lot from that and then the story goes on to talk about how as his father got older\nHow they had that the corporations and the father had all these different plans if they developed to try to get money to the kids with the smallest hack impact possible right now the Trump Organization say that you know every year\nEvery year when they did this it was reviewed by the IRS it was reviewed by their lawyers and you know people signed off on this the New York times now goes back and says well you look at this and you look at that and you look at this this this looks a little bit fishy and maybe they shouldn't have been able to do this and they should have paid more taxes on this but you know they're they're going back\nYou know the going back decades on this and the idea being that I guess number one if President Trump says he was self made guy yeah he's probably not telling the truth he got\nHe got a head start that most people don't necessarily get namely that he you know he was was born into this this family that had this incredible well it goes on to say that some of the business deals he made\nWeren't necessarily that good and that you know he was was hurting at the time of\nYou know the the real estate crash back in in the eighties and the deck kinda bailed him out by doing stuff then it also says you know they took advantage of all the different tracks strategies and they kind of pushed the line right transferring money from dad to various family members All right so that's\nThat is a summary I I think of the you know forty page story\nAnd of course it's getting all this attention the New York times has an editorial Donald Trump and the self made sham now he's he's not really a he's not really a self made man you know he inherited a lot of this money or for their parts of Trump Sawyer warrants in New York Times\nI'm of that you know some of the stuff that\nIs defamatory [noise]\nI I Want to talk about the the larger issue here I understand\nThat President Trump is incredibly divisive\nI understand that there's almost no middle ground there that you either love Donald Trump or you have Donald Trump I I get all that\nBut I mean I I really I read this story kind of looking for the smoking gun and what you have to get his his father died decades ago and what you have is a rich guy who\nPassed on his money to his kids Donald Trump President Trump was like the favorite one of the kids\nBut you know essentially from the moment these kids were born\nThey developed like these tax strategies to pass money on to the kids with the least tax impact possible and yes it's not it doesn't appear with Donald Trump is a self made man in the sense of I don't know Horatio Alger or somebody like that\nBut I guess I'm reading all this and I'm trying to figure out you know what what the new ground is here and whether anybody cares I mean I don't know about you but it doesn't come as a surprise to me that I Know President Trump was born into a wealthy family and was able to\nBootstrap off of a lot of the buildings and a lot of the work that his father did and his father was a billionaire who passed that money along to his kids I guess I'm not surprised by any of that\nFor one for seven nine nine when six twenty that's the acting and mortgage talking ...\n... does any of this matter really one way or another to know Donald Trump is president in in twenty Eighteen and I know the New York times is patting yourself on the back we've got this huge expos day I get I I look at it and say I I don't see how this changes anybody's\nMind I mean I I understand the president his narrative is hey I'm just kind of self made guy I'm not sure that there is anybody out there whoever necessarily bought\nInto this you know the president's story as well I got a million dollar loan that I repaid well if you believe the newer at times the the the loan he it it was a lot more than a million dollars but does anybody care I mean I\nI guess I always I assumed that the president was born into a really really wealthy family and that he took a lot of money that he inherited in one fashion or another and he continued kind of the family empire\nRegardless of what his politics is for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the ... mortgage talking text line do you care about any of this we discuss next if you're on the line please hold on to twenty four jak record WTO O. J.\nM. J. look I understand Christmas extremely controversial [laughter] and I understand that [noise]\nSome of the stuff that he says about his background\nIs over the top but if you want to say it's a lie or a fraud or or whatever I I I get and then the New York times bottom line is they do this this this huge piece that says that you know Donald Trump says he kind of self May Day and it's all be a sin but he really did it the inherited all this money from his father and they spent\nIt is a situation where the emotional um basis of all of that\nIs driving facts and that is very very problematic because we want to get to the fact obviously we of course for those who have gone through sexual assault I'm ... ... women who have gone through sexual assault mad as well\nBut we also at this case what's happening is we've got to separate that from the fact that there are a factor in the story and that is part of what the FBI is doing to\nTo basically um you know get the information that they need the background information that they made us so we're going to get through this process but with that being fed what has been horrific thing\nHow this all played out it it it's become a circus it's really trying to destroy people's lives I Know Brett Kavanaugh personally I Know his wife his children I worked with Brett cabin on the Bush administration we worked very closely together he was always incredibly professional\nRespectful to women to all and and really I adore Brett Kavanaugh we all know and love is someone who is has had a stellar career not only in the executive branch but often the judicial branch where he is respected by legal experts on both sides and it's just so unfortunate that we've ended up\nThrowing away and stellar career to focus on high school and yearbook and all this craziness that we're saying\nWe're talking in Mercedes Schlafly was the White House strategic communications director US Senator Cory Booker comes out today and he says well the White House should should ditch the cabinet nominations wizard he's innocent or guilty and I guess maybe that is the course of least resistance does that have any appeal to the White House\nLiterally not I mean we look at judge Kavanaugh's record and he has that he's going to be an independent judge he has a very strong judicial record I mean over three hundred opinions red and\nHe's obviously served in the district ... circuit court of appeals which is the second highest court in a land has gone through six FBI investigations demand is more than beyond qualified\nThere is no question in my mind about that what the Democrats are doing is that if they obviously want to delay stall resist a destroy\nAs much as they can because they're\nThey're trying to bet on on the audit election I mean they are very concerned of who take this to\nThe Supreme Court position right so for that for that and this is an all or nothing approach and they're all approaches and an ambush\nA character assassination attempt to basically try to take down whoever President Trump would impact and whether it would have been Kavanaugh or not but I find this to be\nAlone with a look I've been in Washington a for Twenty years and I never in my lifetime seen a is it time to buy one party to absolutely destroy\nThese a judge I just I've never seen anything like that I mean you can take it back to the Clarence Thomas but I mean the the reality is is that they the Democrats are in a ... it all or nothing campaign where they will there they were ambushed they will destroy whoever is going to\nTry to become that act Supreme Court justice happened fever\nWas that kind of ties in with my next question was going to be a ... you sit here and you look at it you think already if this happens to judge Kavanaugh who in their right mind\nKind of tied in with my next question was going to be a ... you sit here and you look at it you think\nAlready if this happens to judge Kavanaugh who in their right mind you reach out to say here I I Want you to be the next justice on the Supreme Court knowing that you're going to get the treatment as well but you know you're going to have stuff that you did in high school or grade school or whatever\nNow plastered and turned into your you're drunk or you're a sexual predator or whatever\nRight and you had senator Cory Booker actually admitting that he would groping girls back in high school or in college I mean it's like it goes to no end right to the Democrats have said okay we're at and not only you know go into the whole\nThe where they've they've accused him of being a rape you know a race someone who was a rape or they've accused him of being a rapist I'm Sorry Dave accused can uh you know being a trunk I mean\nThese are serious accusations and false accusations and and yet new whatever like the liberal media could fine they would throw out there without even verifying\nTheir story and then the Democrats for pile on by staying\nThere is no presumption of innocence our guilt or like Senator senator heroin out that about\nOh man should just shut up I mean I have to tell you if I were if like I don't understand how it senator Tammy Baldwin could just not stand up against the Democrats on that aspect of it is wrong the profits that they have pushed forward when it was just a third of my or\nWhen it went Justice Kagan who by the way hired Brett Kavanaugh um to teach at Harvard these they it was a ... a respectable process and it's like the Democrats have a lot of their minds and are basically saying\nLet's let's wait we have to figure out a way to take it down and I just think that the temperature has been raised so high here in Washington and the stress level that yeah the fact that you have even the senators who feel concerned is Republican senators who are concerned for their safety because you have protesters that will will will\nStop them and get that get in their faces about these things and maybe ... about judge Kavanaugh it's just disgraceful and it needs to stop and it's why majority leader Mitch McConnell has said we are moving forward I vote we need to move forward on the profits we cannot keep\nWaiting um because it's just been to Iran too painful for their families\nAnd if you look in your crystal ball was going to happen at the end of the week or they're going to be enough votes to confirm him\nYou know I'm hopeful that we can get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed there's no one\nWho I Know better who could fit this role who is so incredibly qualified who has been a public servant for over Twenty years who has been someone who has a very much it's a well respected in the legal circles\nAnd will be an excellent addition to the court but sadly what we're going to the it's someone who is who who the Democrats have made it a point to destroy his reputation and that well how long lasting effect\nI'm ... and for us to have to tell you it really is just something I a process I'm that's been one of the most disgraceful process as I have seen in Washington\nAnd the Democrats defeat to stop and and that's why\nI'm just so disappointed in and senator Tammy Baldwin for not\nJust standing up against the Democrats in this process that's been so unfair and that would not only to Dr Ford but so unfair to a judge Kavanaugh and had family\nA Mercedes I have one time but they have to ask you you you and your position to report directly to the president what was it like working for president [laughter]\nYou know I'm I feel so honored and blessed to not only worked for President Trump to search for the American people\nAre here and in Washington DC obviously when you go into the west wing\nYou carry this great burden of those who\nAre served before you and do you recognize that it's a\nBig pig responsibility so I you know one thing about President Trump and I've worked for two presidents President George W. Bush and President Trump is that President Trump is very results oriented he wants to keep pushing and driving and thinking and figuring out how we can\nThink outside of the box when it comes to Washington obviously Congress has very slow moving and so the president has been able to\nPush things through I mean we had a huge victory this week with a renegotiation of NAFTA the U.S and the a and a and it's it's one of our biggest trade agreements that we've made and that is\nAn ass instead of focus on protecting our American workers are American farmers and ensuring that we can get more market access for agricultural good that's a huge news for the\nFirst states like Wisconsin and even ... access into more Gary markets that so it's very important and complement that were saying you know obviously the untold story of the economy which we're having direct impact on American families at our businesses where you're seeing American businesses invest more\nIn our nation and what you're saying families\nBeing able to keep more money in their pocket the their victories for Americans and I have to tell you he does it 'cause he loves America he wants to keep fighting for America and I have very proud to work with them every single day\nFor cities left the White House strategic communications director thanks for spending some time with a ... new record much appreciate it\nThank you so much absolutely that's a\nThat is she reports she she she still supposition hope kicks you might remember um she replaced Hope Hicks says the White House we teach a communications director reports directly to the president\nIs two fifty four when we come back we're going to be talking to Scott Morris Melissa Barclay great match to find out what they have on their mind so it was contradictory news to ground\nWelcome to the WGM Jay dot coms live streaming feature right now WGM Jay is broadcasting play by play sports or syndicator programming we do not have the rights to stream these broadcasts please check our website for the program scheduling upcoming games\nAnd of course you can hear live play by play and syndication by using a radio and turning to six twenty ...\n\nWintertime I'm there Tom thanks for calling from your lips to God's Ears for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that at the accident mortgage ... fine I mean I think you raised a couple of really interesting points first of all\nI mean you you look at the incredible yeah so ... of of this team I mean there's there's really not a weak spot in the team okay maybe you say you like a catcher that could hit a little bit better but but beyond that I mean you know you talk about an outfield you talk about an infield is there any\nYou know group starting players that you could put together that the team is perhaps better know you\nCan say okay well we'd like to have you know more of the great starting pitchers okay but All right if I even if I give you that even if they don't have the ... what the brewers have it is I think arguably the deepest and the best bullpen\nAnd major league baseball and I'll tell ya there's not any it's not a team that wants to play the brewers if the brewers are head after five innings so if you get starting pitching the can rise to the occasion and get past this and then you couple that with others I don't know a lot of potential here\nOr let's go to your Facebook Live page we are going to go all the way Mike says now that the cubs are out the brewers are clearly the team to beat their easily the best team left of the national league while we shouldn't get arrogant or complacent and they'll believe me I'm not arguing that I think we can be confident that they are going to go far\nYeah that's that's the point this out there um let's see Scott says I think they sweep Colorado and then um beat the I think they shoot Colorado and then beat the Braves or Brad says we will win the pennant the world series [noise]\nBringing new weather traffic ... brewers box we are ... radio station he was radio do any GM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nTen o'clock it's eighty degrees cloudy and windy with thunder storm scattered about the next few hours then getting chili flows around forty nine from the WTO O.

Clark Howard show hello kale hey how are you great are you getting married I Am a little more than a year away\nAll right how can I be of help with this wedding coming up\nI'm I'm trying to go ahead and start looking at options for our honeymoon we both want to go somewhere tropical in the Caribbean and so I was kinda curious as to whether you thought a travel agents are worse you know getting or of course water on the ... with all this time of that\nDepends on how much experience you have doing Caribbean island vacations\nNot much we went to grand Cayman or with their parents on us but you know and I'm planning I'm only twenty three so\nSo that's definitely a situation where you want the services of an experience travel agent\nOkay generally someone who has a seat tc designation certified traveler counselor they've gone through extensive education and continuous training to be an expert at helping plan your trip\nAnd I'm not going to be as cheap as buying some package on the Internet\nBut okay this is your honeymoon and if you buy something that looked great and you get there and it's a disaster that's a terrible way to spend that honeymoon so far as cheap as I Am\nI Would say this is a case where you don't want to cheap out and okay you're a real advanced planner Jim this more time\nBefore you really start trying to look at possibilities 'cause you're too far ahead for availability and for any sense of pricing\nAnd be clear what you really enjoy doing for activities do you want to do scuba you know you said you've been came and did you go scuba diving there or snorkeling\nWithin within yeah oh so you're a license scuba\nAnd we went we actually went snorkeling\nK 'cause I think through the kinds of things you might enjoy you have plenty of times since you've got so much time what if you both consider taking one of the dive courses where you live okay and then that opens up a whole different series of possibilities for your honeymoon\nOkay cause you enjoy the snorkeling right right right nothing like being a diver\nAnd that's a much more enjoyable experience I've I've done dives doing something called snoop ... and I also did something I should not have done I did an unlicensed scuba dive\nI'm lucky I'm Alive no talk about that [laughter] oh I'm getting looks I really did and unlicensed scuba dive and or is it that almost did not end with me still being with us I'm telling you it was\nNasty story but enough anyway it's if you're going to do a Caribbean thing there are a number of places you can go that that really brings the trip to a new level if you have this Google license or or you can do short of that and do this new but where you can go twenty feet down\nLogan but a but a a certified travel ... will really be able

clothing retailers will double discount so bell say forty percent off plus another twenty percent off\nAnd so in your mind what's forty plus twenty sixty percent off but no it's not because the twenty percent is off the already reduced price which makes it less of a discount and it seems\nIt was a study done at the University of Minnesota they found that\nWhen people were told look for the tricks and how something's priced and they were given calculators people still consistently\nMade the wrong purchase decision influence too much by the online sour or the physical stores marketing ads or in

anyway\nWell congratulations\nThank you very much\nHow can I be of service within us Ryan\nWell [noise] I set up some fair alerts and have been watching a fair price but it seems like Hawaii is a little bit of a different animal and we've seen fairs like eleven twelve hundred dollar range\nWhat are you trying to go from Europe to Hawaii where are you talking about\nOh ...\nOh man okay so the way you buy a ticket to Hawaii is you only shot fares from the west coast\nOkay because from Milwaukee you can get to the west coast\nReally cheaply their sales all the time and then from the west coast there's been cell after cell after cell to Hawaii\nOkay so if you if you do this thing called breaking the fare on the west coast where you have one ticket the west coast and another to Hawaii it'll cut your overall cost probably in half\nOkay now some of the things you should do is you've been looking at the fair shopping sites fine but with Hawaii um once you're looking at the websites of Hawaiian Airlines\nAlaska Airlines and Virgin America especially those three\nOkay for affairs from the west coast to Hawaii when things is because you can city shop\nIf there's a great deal let's say from San jose California and it's better deal than Los Angeles or there's a better deal from uh San Diego then there is from San Francisco you just pick any of them and that's where you fly on on your mainland ticket from Milwaukee okay so\nThis is great to know and the Virgin America is the nation's best domestic airline and they've been offering some great prices\nIs a fantastic\nWell I Want to make sure you have a great time how are you going to pick your accommodations on the various Hawaiian Islands\nWe hear that part already and I've been listening here for a while and we actually did the air being beer out\nGreat after looking at a couple of the different um rental sites and we landed on that to\nHave you bought your Costco membership yet\nI already have that that are ... by that so I was ... to hear that\nAll right well it sounds like you're sad and are you doing anything to have your wedding the extra affordable\nNo [laughter] good honest answer will have a great wedding a wonderful honeymoon and a great life together ginger with us on the Clark Howard show Hi ginger how are you I'm great thank you ... how can that be of service to you\nWell we want to get guy earthquake got insurance and a conference I still think very brief him all\nThey had a free place lack at two hundred and fifty thousand for the house at south and the house has actually it was seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar and also I get ... stops me thirty seven thousand five hundred and we're just wondering if that is\nAt a common or reasonable\nWell ... you want to have your house insured for what it will actually cost to rebuild it do you have\nA sense in your neighborhood if there was a vacant lot how much the vacant lot would be worth of their house on that they were going to scrape the lot and build a new house what the what the builder would pay for the land\nI like to have an idea\nBecause the key is not what you did what somebody coming in to buy your place would pay because they're paying for the land in the house it would be what it costs to rebuild the house on your homeowner's policy\nWhich you have I guess years of experience with what did they say your house is worth for the actual structural purpose\nFor the house that South\nYeah with your regular homeowners forgetting earthquake\n[noise] um I think seven around seven hundred thousand\nHow many square feet do you think your house is\nA lot faster than one hundred\nOkay it would be it would be unusual recall seven hundred and fifty dollars a foot to rebuild your house and I wonder if there is how far yeah right but even with that that's um\nThe the big cost again is the land the house sits on I think so you know they don't replace the land they only replace the house and I'm always worried about people being under insured on a home\nMhm which is why I'm going I'm feeling nervous even talking about it this way with you\nBut it may be and I I don't know it may be two hundred and fifty dollars a foot to rebuild or maybe it's five hundred or whatever it's when it's going to cost you to rebuild the home and it is the amount the insurance should be for\nSo do you deal with an agent a toll free number how did you get the quote on the earthquakes insurance\nWell we have a nurse and I'm really\nCame up for renewal and when it came up for renewal and they send us out something that said they have to by law offer you the earthquake also\nRight so I call and do you deal with an agent at that homeowners insurance or do you call a toll free number\nA tougher number\nTo call the toll free number and say please explain and I get your homeowner's policy out and see what the coverage is our please explain why the coverage is for the house are listed is so much less on the earthquake rider than they are on the actual policy\nI see okay because they should match\nIt really is seven hundred dollars a foot for you to rebuild than you know you would need coverage like he talked about on your house and the thing with the earthquake insurance same for people who live at the coast to have to have a hurricane insurance uh-huh is the deductibles are crazy high\nAnd that's just something you're gonna have to live with\nThirty seven thousand is reasonable\nI didn't say is reasonable it's typical chemical that yeah I I like that but I'm I'm more I'm as nervous as you are to make sure you're not under insured and that of course will make the premium go up\nBut you want to make sure you have the right coverage Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Michael how are you doing great thank you Michael what's going on in your world\nUm well I Am very proud to say that yesterday I make a last payment on my student loan my wife and I have been put in about ... eleven hundred dollars a month for that and finally got paid off as of yesterday and\n[noise] well I take your calls for a celebration\nYes my wife and I broke out the ... brand a wine last night [laughter] great\n[laughter] but yeah what what do I look for is I'm advice to see where an ... going to start putting a towards our retirement now that maybe we can start you know that more now for a family vacation as\nWell certainly you freed up a eleven hundred dollars a month you need to treat yourself so if you were to to take like the first two months after you pay these off take eleven hundred dollars twice take twenty two hundred dollars go do something fun\nTo go reward yourself you worked hard to pay off that that you got rid of it and you know\nIt's not supposed to be just drudgery followed by more drudgery there needs to be a reward a privilege that comes at\nThe end you it's privilege time so yeah and if you want to take a vacation you go on vacation\nWonderful and and I guess the follow up with that I actually work in a a a decent amount away both my wife and I we have governor\nAnd ... we're we're going to have current tensions on thirty four she's thirty three and all

started to someone that extreme political bias is one of the sickest jokes out there the national council of churches has been a a left wing propaganda machine for some years now\nOr you know they they don't say that so it just it it sounds like\nA rural respectable and it's like this Catholic magazine America there there are ... into a vote against Kavanaugh and nothing better to make for operate it you know it's ridiculous it's a big scam you know actually big scam\nWell it it certainly I'll put it this way I Would say that the uh the national council of churches is not reputable but for them to be making a claim about about partisanship is\nIt is a as I say as a joke because they are among the most part as groups out there they're as legitimate as any other left wing political organizations just to pay mass graves is somebody else to a travesty and delusion Alabama and grieving Travis\nAnd I'm home I wanted to comment on your\nPresident Trump bless them but a yes you're absolutely right they should have used a whole lot more tact um during his uh his rally that did absolutely no good um bowling a China shop for those comments and like you said absolutely it gives an excuse for other people\nSay well I'm I'm appalled by the wayside I'm not not impressed with that but that well\nIt was unfortunate and and again as I say every word he said was absolutely accurate it's just the lord yeah\nYes absolutely on board completely this whole thing out\nWell it open my eyes to a lot of 'em I mean the Democrats are right out in the open with their tactics how they do things how they have no issue was marrying someone I'm In this particular gentleman\nBeing how there is no cooperating witnesses or any of this to happen Thirty years ago as very convenient right here at the very last minute which our and for it to just like everyone saying just drag on um [noise]\nIt's completely unfair to Mr Kavanaugh\nAnd but in lieu of yes Donald should have um you know here's a little more tact with that particular situation\nBut I I really I I really do feel that way uh uh Travis and I'm Glad that you agree with me I I really do think so but again there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel\nUh we'll we'll see but possibly by by Monday morning or it could be justice Brett Kavanaugh and and the outcome of Washington good evening\nA fake well I've been able to find out her age so birth date and I'm Wondering if she had just turned Fifteen to accumulate is fourteen and then all of this I Wonder for her parents are because at that age of Fifteen year old daughter and a line\nA wedding and it's where they didn't know who took her their to their home or anything like that and so I can sign Steiner go in and go out of the Senate and\nIt's on a ... a couple of nights ago someone asked him if he was an ad been reading that sheriff heated and what he did that extending it and he said no that's going against his old but if you could find out where actual birth date that would be fine and\nUh we just have to hope that it's turning out right and\nIce and that I feel for his family and his parents and for the whole world because it's going to be so many people come out and clean and her ... cents a net is farmers everything\nAbsolutely I appreciate your book very much and\nUh I don't know where he exact age I agree with you that that does seem as though the parents were not that involved is she was either fourteen or Fifteen\nIn terms of flaking Feinstein not going back to the Senate of course Lakers ... running against Feinstein is

... ... ... even though we got a majority if nominated any war else\nOther than Kevin Lau with big happens is very funny discussion because it would not be guaranteed that there's a slight majority in the Senate Republicans could put the ... novel a I'm a little sprinkle\nWell I mean the fact is that Republicans come in all stripes and there's something we should keep in mind at least in regard to for example Susan Collins a Jesus conservative a senator as you're going to get out of the state of Maine\nI mean the choice was up there or not some conservative who couldn't win ever ever ever the choices are Susan Collins who is conservative on some fiscal issues and others or a flaming off the wall left wing liberal those are the choices so in that regard Susan Collins is\nThe best available

are the left by the way that that doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this has United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump hers and it has it has helped to unite them\nBack to coming home to the Republican Party and a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about set of norms that they did Mrs Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks\nFounder lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed

Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh\nThese are today's democratic norms mhm\nI said to me sometimes for us to be puzzled that more than eighty percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their message methods Republicans have figured out\nThat if the left and willfully even gleefully destroy a man\nAs distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure Republicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false woods but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August call to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit voters know this is about the less will to power by any means necessary republic\nThat the left hates them as much or more than they low Mr Trump conservatives understand that and for the American left\nThey're all deplorable ... yeah I think that's a I think it's a great piece and and right on target

non politician [laughter]\nAll right and and the other the other breaking news and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years\nA this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know a high FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hilltop Tom John Solomon\nA has released the name of the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... cues you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nBut I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which they hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order to\nUh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy of his election\nHe was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that\nThe FBI lead counsel met with the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started the ... the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and we got to the law firm they were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right\nAnd I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that is part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do they say well as well as he says\nTo talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was\nLawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was what the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's\nPrivate law firm ... that's\nThe term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy compiled the dusty a of an cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the dance sees main law firm and was a product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the ... law firm and\nThe FBI we bought the state of that said I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this to be twenty four yeah you can do a capital a seasonal you\nCould do probably more seasons then law and order\nA couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this ... when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or changed because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find

cooperate\nThe account and then of course you take a look at his lifetime of exemplary public service you take a look at the dozens of women who have known him since high school I worked with him had been measured by him or you know how they\nAre certainly providing you know great testimony in terms of what what a great person he is I Know you meet him you're talking about his his daughters or how

nothing\nThat was also a sham argument made to prolong this process and this other before I handed off the news the other silly notion about this whole thing\nIs that somehow the truth would come out

don't believe the testimony that she it was entirely truthful and I'll tell you why [noise]\nAnd when she was in the bedroom with Kavanaugh and the other you know\nAnd I'm quoting from\nDuring this is Mark I'm over it jumped on the bed twice for was on I mean the last time you did this we toppled over on top of me I was able to get out of the directly across from the bedroom with us about Iran in the bathroom and lock the door I heard and mark leave the bedroom\nLaughing wildly walk down the stairs\nFalling off a long way though I waited and one I did not hear them come back up the stairs I was a bathroom random if they're for the living on the\nHow did she know he was going on she was locked in the [noise]\nThere's a lot of inconsistencies both with her testimony thanks for the call jak with her testimony related to what happened that night and also\nUh the way she describes the home lots of inconsistencies with that as well the layout of the home that's been all documented in reported on unfortunately some networks decide not to do that another texture\nDecide not to do that another texture add from Milwaukee or the judge will be confirmed because this country was founded on the on the principle of innocent until proven guilty and nothing has been proven\nGreat points when I hear about is fairness fairness to Christine Blasey Ford the fairness of Brett Kavanaugh because of the conduct of Democratic senators that has not been afforded to either one of these two people\nWhat do we know about Christine Blasey Ford to professor Palo Alto university resident of California\nShe came forward with some testimony in July presented to Dianne Feinstein and former the letter\nAsked for confidentiality\nAnd that information was leaked to the Washington Post was involved there is some tax exchanges between Christine Blasey Ford in there and the reporters eventually some digging and that's kind of a this the steam rolling effect of all that early information\n\nAnd I said this before you can believe her that she she believes that this is what happened but she could be mistaken\nJust like anybody can on the facts on the people involved and clearly as like details at the beginning of the show the number of people involved\nThe genders of some of the people involved descriptions of the house where this house was frankly all the things the president raised in in the wrong way it is Mississippi address the other night\n\nAnd for all those folks are saying I'm not critical the president do you listen to the show what the president did Tuesday night Mississippi was not helpful it might have made some of those folks in that crowd feel good\nBut also mentally presidents are about getting things done or should be at least\nAnd if getting things done in this case means getting enough votes that speech didn't help both Republicans and Democrats agree on that is that we're a bit of bipartisanship\n\nWhat'd you say matters and then the case of course in Bosnia for what she said is not being corroborated nor is a testament to the other accusers who came for two or three or four\nAnd thankfully which would I guess most of us knew before this process happen the FBI said here's what we have here is our reports you can read them maybe a couple of the same conclusion we did that there's really nothing to see here\n\nI'm not sure what the Democrats thought they were doing with this I guess I Am sure their strategy seems to be\n\nSeeking destroy whatever what were you have to do to get it done clearly stepping over the lines of decency when it comes to protecting someone who's confidential identity theatrics which we saw him play out clearly in the first piece of the cabinet I hearing and unfortunately the second is well\nHere's the bottom line though there's a lot of really\nRecent polling done in the country and what are we been talking about for a while this enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans\nSurprise surprise according to some recent polling that gap has been eliminated why do you think that is because most reasonable rational people in the United states has said you know what we're looking at this story play out\nThe way that the CNNs and the and the MSNBC is are covering this story Ninety percent gossip ten percent fact\n\nThe breathless here's how the president is angry today stories and you you don't I'm not going to tell you who these people are you could watch CNN and find out for yourself not reporting gossip column this\n\nBottom line he's a good judge has been court of appeals Washington DC for a long time the women that actually know Brett Kavanaugh enthusiastically support\nHim all the people who don't know Brett Kavanaugh like these random law professors across the country who are signing his letter because they don't want a conservative justice on the Supreme Court why should I care about what they think\nThey do know Brett Kavanaugh the women that know him support him\nExcept of course high school friends in air quotes\nWho come forward out of political\nReasons rather than realistic or legal reasons we should all be ashamed by this process but again at the end of the day these are the folks we sent to Washington not California they love this stuff\nWell I Do a quick fact check look at the people at CNN put on as elected officials\n\nHalf of them come from California what does that tell you about CNN\nHalf of them come from California\nThere's a built in ... in the people that you select to put on your shows and frankly CNN I think they've hired every staffer\nOf Hillary Clinton to work on a network as a as a commentator really\nI understand you're not\nDealing with the twenty sixteen last probably as well as

is working now it's not perfect one of my friends was on the other side of the house tells me to remember that this is also a plan that increases the deficits\nAnd there are risks associated with that\nBut the measured risk is that the economy will grow at such a rate\nYou can minimize the impact on deficit and to some degree that's working\nBut there's there's that reality at all and I've called out Republicans for not understanding the fiscal responsibility is just as important as some of the policy decisions you make and uh we've seen a shift away from a traditional conservative perspective\nWay from a traditional conservative perspective that says we should we need to balance our budget whether it's at the local level state level or national level and we've gotten away from that and that's something that I think Democrats can rent the call out Republicans on let's talk quickly about the the McDonald's strike or the fast food strikes\n\nDemanding that a fast food restaurant pays entry level high school\nEmployees owned bother employees I waited Fifteen dollars a that was an hour sounds great\nBut it's unrealistic\nOne\nEntry level jobs are just that they're not meant to be family sustaining jobs if you want to make Fifteen dollars an hour at McDonald's or another fast food chain there are ways you can do that and those ways are measured by the work that you do the fact that you show up on time\nAnd your willingness to embrace your company's philosophy on doing business and to embrace leadership and the things they tell you that demonstrate how to advance within a company that's how you get to Fifteen dollars an hour\nWe don't hands you an elevated wage in a fast food restaurant just because you demand it\n\nNow there's there's arguments on the Amazon thing one of the big critique says that they're rolling back some of their benefits and that is always a negotiation between employers and employees that they have to figure out ultimately they've got to decide what's best for their company\n\nPeople forgets corporations take risks\nThey make smart decisions smart smart calls those risks benefit their employees\nEither and in the form of a stock plan increased benefits wages bonuses whatever and every company is different large to small\n\nBut understanding ... economics and economic development is not something that Democrats have been very good at because what did they promise or demand I should say Fifteen dollar an hour away across the board\n\nFree healthcare free whatever fill in the blank free tuition\n\nExcusing of student loan debt and the loans that are associated with that\n\nThat's not a plan those are empty promises made in campaigns and looked at the candidates who are doing this you got some right here in Wisconsin Tammy Baldwin clearly\n... well over her skis when it comes to economic development Tammy Baldwin knows nothing about hunk of companies work oh manufacturing worst frankly only time Tammy Baldwin see the inside of a manufacturing facility is winning she's running for office and slap a brand new heart at honor\nThat's it's\nNot an expert on manufacturing most Democrats arts if they weren't they would understand that tax incentives can build growth in companies it's not universal is an absolute but the trends in this country are amazing when you look at the economic developed and we're we're seeing happen\n\nThere's always going to be given take between employers and employees I understand that\nBut people got a wake up\nThese are good stories for America\nThe Amazon the facts they want to increase our presidents in Wisconsin the fact that Foxconn is willing to do what they're doing why do you think Democrats that stopped talking about Foxconn because they realize at some points when talking about you Mandela bars Tony Evers Randy Bryce in Tammy Baldwin\nThey don't know what the heck they're talking about\nAfter the break I Want to talk about a local couples who are

Democrat I just saw this one pop up an sweater\nSusan Collins it appears to be a very thorough investigation I talked about earlier Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois commenting on why didn't talk to all the witnesses and shaming his Republican colleagues on on what he says this is the lack of a thorough investigation\nThat's all nonsense this thing has been vetted by as much as you can bet

been beat up and the the senators all Lebanon them all men whatever interviewed her we understand how the game's played we saw the conduct of Democratic senators\nThroughout the first part of the Kavanaugh nomination process the way they treated him the fact that he was treated like a criminal even though he's been I respect a juror for many years on the court of appeals in Washington DC\nAnd I've told you throughout the show today it's not about justice is not about fairness it's not about trying to get to the truth about is pure politics\nAnd networks some networks not all some networks

you say we may not agree with you but we do pay attention to what you say when you invite someone before the process starts suggest the process isn't fair at all\nAnd you found a woman who\nWanted to

the cost of the bill I was thinking about that when I was when I was debating what to do this this uh topic I'd probably say about two hundred bucks\nFor table and the Internet and that's probably another maybe what one Ninety and that's I think that's an a high end but it is irritating this thing that we're spending that much for services that really probably should cost about a third of that\nWhat do you think for one for seven nine nine one six twenty uh I did research this and it and it costs today about roughly between three hundred and five hundred dollars to have a really high quality HTML tenants selling your home but one of course once that happens\nYou don't have the monthly bill in more and more people are saying you know what let's shed that bill that's getting

on top of the rough now small one on top of the rough and ah it's running as between four and five hundred\nFor him to our including parts to put it down\nYeah that's what I said thanks for the call Jim ... which roughly there'll be some association between about three fifty and five hundred dollars but\nI I can tell you having seen some friends that have this uh these HTML tendencies known as the receptionist crystal clear um couple of Texas wing and it's worth it to cut the cord I'm keeping the courses I enjoyed brewers on Fox Sports Wisconsin Jeff in Fox pointed downgraded to having no

have it I've seen some of the reception actually called ... and the reception on these things as athletes is the best picture you could ever happening the qualities amazing I think when you when you think about\nTechnology sometimes that technology comes with a price tag and I and I and annoying Wisconsin I 'cause I've been there so long they pay attention to their bills\nAnd they know that uh you know seeing a hundred dollars or a hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars every month for something they could get for maybe a quarter or a or a third of that price do\nAnd then the radio

Illinois or words of Democrats Hillary last get over it or get psychiatric help um the great Dennis Miller comedian\nRadio show host um he occasionally tweets this out and I love to read this um he's he's done is about once a month for the last year or so\nI don't I just don't think the Democrats have handled Hillary's loss as well as they could have and it really speaks to a truth here\nAnd I don't condone what Brett Kavanaugh did in his testimony to link the Clintons to his nomination but the the over arching reason why I think he said that other than the fact that he was just out of his mind mad of the way he's him in his family been treated\nWas there has been a an effort by Democrats to try to avoid the results with twenty six teen election by trying to blow up this nomination process\nAnd it hasn't been successful and I don't think it will be successful America's substance surprises here with a Kavanaugh's nomination but it appears from what I'm hearing from the center of flakes and senator Collins and the senator Murkowski's and others that this will move forward as soon as this weekend so we may have a\nSupreme Court judge Kavanaugh as soon as Sunday maybe even Saturday and spending on the logistics of it but that process is now in motion\nAnd I think when you look at this you have to consider the role of politics and all this stuff\nAnd none of this is new we've always had politics in our lives also politics shaping the national conversation it's just me entered into a world that's not\n... even closely related to the facts and it's about people saying things that aren't true now the president is guilty of this as well\nAnd I'm gonna spend some time uh after eleven thirty talking about the tax issue which is one of those big stories now swirling as a result of New York times piece on his history\nOf how he got where he was the the methods and the practices they use to avoid paying taxes and I'll make some arguments that some of that might be a

um has had problems with telling the truth himself over his long career so uh that's the other side of that equation and that's probably pretty much what you get that's why I said last week seventh investigation eighth investigation ninth tenth eleventh twelve whatever there's no way any of these Democrats are changing their minds\nTheir minds were made up the moments Kavanaugh was picked I think twenty minutes after that nomination went out Chuck Schumer already waiting real quick Georgetown University they have an associate professor her name is Christine fair on Saturday she tweeted this\nShe's talking about the the entitlements of white people white men regarding the cabinet nomination all of them deserve and miserable death while feminist laugh as they take their last gas\nBonus we cast rate their corpses and feed them to swine yes that's where he has not been deleted prompting the president of Georgetown University to denounce her is associate professor and her demands\nYeah that other than the fact that it's an ugly tweets because it shows you the disparity and just the uh the vile nature of the attacks on his nomination in this process\nSo this is what fair also said in Rochefort retrospect I should've blogged about this rather than tweeting it but my intention was a throwback to kind of hate I gave them in one of the forums I get to make people uncomfortable as I feel my discomfort is not caused by ...\nAre financial advisors to say this is what you should do to minimize how much you pay so we can go back and forth on that\n[noise] the reason I questioned the reporting is because the maneuvers that were utilized by the trumps according to this piece of New York times suggest they weren't met with any resistance from the Internal Revenue service\nThey didn't raise red flags and that it's really the the body that would ultimately determine other than a court of law if somehow they did something about it\nHere's what the attorney for Donald Trump said Charles Jay harder written statements the New York times allegations of fraud and tax evasion or a hundred percent false and highly defamatory there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times basis is false allegations are extremely inaccurate\nAnd he also feeding the attorney separated the strategies of Donald J Trump was that it was family and said that the president had delegated those job duties those pass to other tax professionals not the excuse is that if he did anything wrong\nAll of this begs the question is this reporting\nOr is this inserting politics into reporting and I've started to look into the reporters and I'm not ready to talk about that element of the story but I Want to see because there's there's a there's a new new storyline happening and national reporting look to the past\nLook to the comments of reporters\nWhether it's social media blogs columns opinion pieces that suggest a built in bias in this case any history that suggests a biased towards president Donald Trump\nDoesn't mean the stories inaccurate we don't know that yet but again the arbiter of those decisions the IRS Internal Revenue service and the court system\nAnd to this point the president has said my returns are under audit therefore I won't released another challenge for people living United States has been the president has not released his tax returns which every president has done since Gerald Ford everyone\nNow that you could argue this president probably has the most complex tax returns of any president ever\nCritics have said Democrats have said what's in these tax returns why don't you want to release and that's a valid concern given the history and the standard of people running for president show us your tax returns how did you make their fortunes how people live their life\nAnd many voters then use that information to make a decision is not absolutes here\nFor one for seven nine what six twenty accident

that is right on the\nBut any sort of different dynamics that it's Colorado instead of Chicago it is however all good All right I hate to say I told you so but I did tell you so over the course of the last couple weeks when we've been talking about the Brett Kavanaugh situation\nA number of people would call in or they would text in and the argument they would make is we need to delay this we need to delay it so the FBI can do an investigation and I would challenge people who would say that to me and my challenge would be\nWhat do you think an investigation is going to show it in the case of the cabinet situation you have the woman who's come forward and accused him of doing this\nSheik and I didn't believe I'm not mocking her but she has no details she says I Can't remember where this where this was I Can't remember precisely when it was\nI Can't tell you anybody else who were there except these other two there's only two people one of my friends and then this mark judge guy other than that I have absolutely no details about this\nAnd so the lady that she ... she comes out she publicly says look I I she never said anything I have no recollection of being at a party like this mark judge\nHe's given statements under oath saying I had this never happened that no recollection of this I never saw times that consistent with his Brett Kavanaugh's testified under oath but it didn't happen that this is thirty some years ago and my challenge was what do you think an investigation is going to to show\nIt's not like you have somebody who makes an accusation of something that happened a week ago or a month ago or maybe even a year ago where you have a chance of going back and being able to recreate records and things like that\nIf I'm the FBI agent\nFor the FBI agent who supervising this\nAnd this lands on my desk but we'll see what do you do what what do you do you say okay well you know go out let's re interview this person let's we interview that person but the truth of the matter is\nYou're never going to be able to come up with any evidence as to what did or did not happen thirty plus years ago and that was always the point that I was making well All right\nLast week at the Senate Judiciary committee they agree to stall the vote\nFor a week to allow the FBI to go out conduct investigation now so far the general public is not seeing the results of the investigation\nBut some of the senators who have are talking about it in broad terms and what they're saying is that there is nothing new in there it's plows absolutely no new ground for anybody who thought that there was going to be some smoking gun\nThat they found implicated Brett Kavanaugh and it's just not true and and it's simply because again what ever did or did not happen thirty six years ago it's so long ago that you're never going to be able to find any sort of corroborating evidence the investigation\nTo the extent that anybody thought it was going to break new ground it was doomed from from the start but now you apparently have the investigation that's been undertaken\nThe summaries that you're hearing from some people are saying well there's there's there's nothing in it that implicates Brett Kavanaugh beyond again the statement\nOf you know Dr Ford who who says this is what happened but there's absolutely no corroborating evidence so we're back where we were at the beginning of this whole thing which is\nThe woman makes the accusations against him there's absolutely no corroborating evidence of this what do you do with it so in that context I thought it was interesting one of the senators and\nCory Booker is a senator from New Jersey and he he he's one of these guys that like like so many of US Senators both Republicans and Democrats when they looked in a mirror they see they see a president and Cory Booker is the guy who desperately wants to be the president the United states he\nHas come out that he had said regardless of what the FBI probe signs\nAnd the FBI pro from what I understand it's nothing new it's plowed new ground he\nSays that the Senate needs to move on and whether or not he's innocent or guilty whether or not there's any corroborating evidence or not\nThat I'm Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh should be rejected by the Senate\nSimply because well he doesn't have the temperament now to be a justice on the Supreme Court 'cause we all saw how angry he was\nThat he was accused in his mind fall asleep being a sexual predator so now the argument is it doesn't matter we've got no corroborating evidence but we should still vote no because he lacks judicial temperament right let's open up the phone lines for one for seven nine what six twenty Tennessee I get a mortgage talk and text line\nIn some respects so we were talking to yesterday I had an opportunity to interview on the air the White House director of strategic communications in some respects it would be the course of least resistance to simply say All right we've we've had all these attacks on Brett Kavanaugh he's had to defend himself\nIn a way that you know comedy has ever had to defend themselves in the past\nBut because he's angry because he didn't like this maybe it'll be easier just to move on and say let's find somebody else and that presumably is with Cory Booker is saying hey innocent guilty doesn't matter\nTime to move to whatever plan B is for one for seven nine nine one six twenty is that what percentage should do when it votes on the nomination and it will vote on the nomination tomorrow and Saturday for one for seven nine what six twenty

I Believe that it's fundamentally an ethical for a prosecutor to bring criminal charges in a case\nThat they know where should know that they have absolutely no chance of being able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and that is clearly the case\nSo don't miss the first pitch of this game for one for seven nine nine one six twenty if you're just joining us\nThe FBI reports it is now complete\nAs I said when we were having this conversation over the last several weeks\nJust as a practical matter I don't know what the FBI investigation was going to reveal because the the allegations against judge Kavanaugh are old and they're on confirmable because of the passage of time\nUm the lack of recollection of some of the accusers so this is the fact that they've turned up nothing is is no surprise at all but there's still a number of prominent Democrats are saying it doesn't matter what it turned up or not he should still be voted down let's talk to Suzanne in Greenville Suzanne WTO O. J. good afternoon\nThank you thank you for taking my call and I wanted to every now and I think that a lot of people are saying about not only is your story I'm cooperated statements are folk\nSinger freighted flying an end and then later Richard and Richard's flying all over the world and then her story about the claim that were there\nLast ... not only not cooperated refuted and then stories out the door to door she said that she had and I find that the house trying out\nFor ... dining on design energy thousand and five years and she and she didn't enjoy the charm and then also the lie about the polygraph not knowing if you're being videotaped by her lawyers and probably grass\nI mean you're learning what is happening you know I'm a\nLawyer and certainly inconsistency showed me that there's there's clearly inconsistencies I guess but what about the whereabouts of more fundamental thing that that the allegations in them all in and out themselves\nCompare and you look at that plus the way he reacted he he was angry et cetera et cetera is that enough for should that be enough to disqualify him from Supreme Court\nSmart you know Andrea Mitchell Mitchell she the kinds of caring everyone if you're going to bring a case as far as whether it's similar I don't know you don't have evidence that your claim you can't just go to court or ... and ... and on and say that ... years my Alan ... and you know some kind of evidence that\nPlane if you will see that brings some claiming and it's found in your case or not I mean they could actually do you practice your sent an email and can really in the same\nFor slander against or if you wanted to pursue that you can just darn fell and he had a lot of the electorate allegations at some kind of stuff back up\nPlan like regional Mitchell no reasonable prosecutor can not only is it just an Asian but if you're if you didn't answer story inconsistent and there's a lot of 'em is ... ... actually made you know\n... I mean I understand that and I want to look I I have already said if I was in the U.S Senate I Would vote for judge Kevin I Would vote to confirm him I think he has had the qualifications to be a Supreme Court judge and I don't think that you should be saying no to people\nBased on uncorroborated serious allegations of misconduct and unproven bowling uncorroborated allegations of misconduct I don't think that's fair to the process\nI don't think that's fair to anybody who's going to be a nominee now having said that do that we're we're not in a court of law where we're not in innocence until proven guilty our first caller was saying well I think they traditional criminal charges against it well so to respect that's ridiculous I mean nobody's\nNo prosecutor is going to\nBring a criminal charge based on an unsupported uncorroborated and unproven bowl allegation from thirty six years ago but at the same time we are talking about innocent until proven guilty it's not a criminal setting it's not a civil setting it's a sin at the U.S Senate in the context of\nAdvising in consenting to kill a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court so it is a different standard for one for seven nine when six twenty\nSill in mosquito Phil thanks for waiting your WTO O.
