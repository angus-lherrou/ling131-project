{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "And one of the many aspects of this story that we continue to discuss the is if it's more than just honoring the victims of nine eleven there's more to this memorial one of the other faces is a U.S military components honoring those who have served our country from Wisconsin and some of those who do not return\nTo be able to live free lunch like the rest of us are able to do that and one of those names with David Johnson army first lieutenant from made bill who lost his wife serving our country overseas and his parents joined us in Studio ... Andrew and Laura Johnson thank you both for being here today more\nThank you very much Eric and Steve for having us and we're delighted to be here uh uh obviously something terrible happened in our in our family but um\nWe hope that um some good could come out of it feels a little bit about David well and Laura feel from China and it's my wife Laura's with me today to David I'm he grew up in rural Wisconsin uh went to high school I always had an\nInterest in service service serving his community he will of course was an Eagle Scout is kind of Eagle Scout he was it takes Twenty one bad just to become an Eagle Scout I think David had forty three forty five so he goes right over to see if I Would say he was a little bit on that\nUm he he you want to join the army is his parents were were not supportive at first but when when he did join the course and we were very supportive\nUm he joined the military he wanted to be an officer always and he joined his regular enlisted and and then he transferred to the ROTC program so he was in the army as a as an enlisted person and then became an officer and he went to a in Springfield, Missouri\nAnd he was a he led the bearer of Italian and his ROTC\nHe became a second lieutenants\nAnd I'm a he of course like all young lieutenants want it to a a hit all this training and so forth and he wanted to use the skills and a year after some training I think he went to um what is ranger training he broke his ankle and the second phase that he got your most of his ranger train\nAnd um then he was destroyed or is deployed in January of two thousand twelve or actually December of two thousand twelve\nTwenty alive and I'm Sorry yeah twenty alive and he was deployed\nAnd um so he was a ... who is a bigger than life type guy he had a lot of friends a lot of female friends and uh just a bigger than ... to the Afghan people called David demand with a big smile that's why they identified him see it a big big bright smiled big guy\nUm he was um he started a train with this man I Believe for four or five months he trained with his men at Fort Lewis and I'm near Seattle and\nThen he was deployed at the end of a a lot of 'em in and he um\nHe he operated a forward operating base he was a commander of thinking about forty Americans and twenty a are Afghan nationals and I'm On a mission that he was leading he was killed on January twenty\nTwo thousand twelve songs in an area that was fairly dangerous road was very very dangerous Yeah David David encountered the enemy\nThe enemy many many times and I'm I'm we're very proud to one of the proudest moments we are of him is that when he was leading a convoy um he uh he came under attack by the enemy by a Chinese recoil as rifle which would be like a ... something that would be armor piercing\nAnd I remember his men telling me answer what do we do what do we do and he said we're we're going to keep going and we're going to practice down in David Was an outstanding Boy Scouts\nAnd new latitude ... is very good at and David allow the enemy to fire upon has his crew\nAnd by doing that he he ... the latitude and longitude and the enemy that they look for this weapon for many months actually 'cause it kept getting our troops because just go through anything\nAnd um when we were we were at one of his funeral services in Fort Lewis uh the the weapon is on display or at a in Fort Lewis added David recovered and save many Americans so we're very proud of him for things like\nThat and more as his mom how did nine eleven shape your son's life\nI think it's just had a you know the ... you know the country and just the way it he'll do everybody together and I can't say that necessarily after that he said you know what I Want to do I think it was you know a lot of components in it you know\nEspecially Boy Scouts that had a huge you know you were surprised though when you wanted to go to the are no no I was not surprised now I went to the price of oil\nAnd he's the guy he like David like to be very well prepared date he had his belt that he carried on him in the army was they called the Batman belt\nBecause he had everything they called me and I am thinking about being a scout is you're always say\nThat I can remember when he was younger putting that his ... you know getting ready for Boy Scouts and he would come up with a uniform on and he just you know it just puffed they mail you could just see that pride in uniform so that didn't surprise me that transferred to the military\nAnd as your you told me that the community he loved working with the local Afghan is to like you see some of the resident yes that was something for him\nYeah it was his job to go round of the different a little villages near where his Ford operating base was and he would meet with the Afghan leaders and have to be with them\nAnd um it was a very very dangerous um and what he would talk about what we would be um you know the Afghans of tell them will soon as you leave that ... you know these these people um um if you you know like I said was try and help build schools and roads and things like that but then\nWhen soon as the the army would leave then they would the Taliban would tell the leaders that we're going to kill your families if you do stuff with the American army so his ... his job to help identify and try to fix that and he showed little villages surrounding his Ford operating base so he became very friendly with the locals\nWe're joined by Andrew I'm Laurie Johnson who some game and was killed in Afghanistan I'm\nPart of the the significance of the WTO cares raised the project is it does tie into those men and women who sacrificed sacrifice in the military as part of their dedication a lot of it related to nine eleven and their connection to the event in our nation's history tragic event\nAfter the break we'll we'll get into your connection to the nine eleven memorial raise the demonization of and all the great things that are happening to kind of educate inform and remember all the all those people who died as a result of that tragedy that's next to Jim ...\nWho's\nLast longer wild ride the first season is over we learn was long sort of progress houses play by play announcer LeBron joins John for one final fact servers and I'll see us run a more efficient Wisconsin afternoon news ah she's pretty with\nYou on this Monday we're talking about Eric they'll step WGM Jake chairs initially\nWe're trying to do is raise the beans are still being from the world Trade Center the now rests in key walk him right now there's a memorial planned and the beans sits on stone in the grass and eventually we want to put that in the air and space one of the memorial project is forty thousand dollar endeavor\nSo we're asking you to help them ... comics the website you can get all the information you can check out the amazing ... of this or you could actually\nSo we're asking you to help them do T. M. J. dot com is the website you can get all the information you can check out the amazing rendering\nOf this or you can facts were being B. E. A. M. for when four seven nine nine one six twenty\nAnd this is more than just honoring the victims ... there are so many other component the education component about how they want to have an atrium or an amphitheater excuse me where people can sit and listen to speakers perhaps someone who survived or perhaps a relative of someone who did not survive that day\nI there is also first responders component to this and the U.S military component and joining us in Studio today is Andrew and Maura Johnston there the parents of David Johnson the army first lieutenant from ... who lost his life serving his country overseas in twenty twelve\nAnd again thanks reached reading from time to be here I Know it's not always easy to be under the lights with cameras on when I can ... microphones anyway and talking about David um as far as the memorial goes what what drew you to this project was it important to be a part of it as\nWell um I I I learned about Gordon and the story of Andrea has a daughter and your cameraman and when I learned that story I I actually reached out to Gordon and\nI just thought like this is something unique special says about him losing his daughter they're also losing our son in response to the nine eleven uh attack\nAnd um when I called Gordon um\nWe instantly had a very emotional and special connection as we do with other military people strange um they talk about her brother loving with people you don't know but uh when we met we instantly had a an amazing connection between us and\nUm um we both have a lot of of the same um\nThings in our life you know losing a child to the enemy and um\nAnd I saw so I think both of us have the the we want to make sure that that that his daughter and my son David as well as the others you know we're not just about our children but the others\nThat um that their life would would not be forgotten and that their life would count and we wanted to make sure I Know I just talked Gordy a few minutes ago and we want to make sure that what the rest of our lives that we will do everything within our ability to make something good out of a very bad situation what the enemy meant for very bad for our country\nAnd of course a filter down to our families\nThat we would not allow that to um to destroy us and our families in our community nor are state of Wisconsin and so we're trying to do something good\nLord I'm looking at a picture of David I'm On my screen here and then as a mom who's lost the sun this project to what what is it what does it mean what's it feel life\nAnd I think for most part even some of these bad actors they've tried to do that many Machado literally could care less if he doesn't care either\nDenies that it happened which there's video we can usually see what happened [laughter] so the gestures that you make in front of the crowd\nYou wonder if that's going to come back to haunt him because he's in free agency now he's ... he wants to make a boat load hasn't value going down over how he's acting\n[noise] a couple of the of the big commentators I saw on Fox said yes others said no bottom line is they're still gonna make two hundred plus million dollars a month or a couple of million I'm not sitting here telling you that he's not talented this guy is incredibly talented and even though he didn't have a terrific series you had a pretty strong series got some hits when they needed it\nAnd it's a tough outs and incredible defensive player although he has some of the same issues and some of the other great defensive players have like are are you are but they they screw up once in a while but uh I think overall he's going to be a guy that's going to be tough town\nSo he's going to be out there I I just wish\nMaybe it's maturity maybe it maybe it's something else that they would get that they have\nSomething beyond just their their athleticism and their talents maybe there's a a level of responsibility maybe I'm just being naive but uh for all of us the brewer season comes to a stunning and shocking and Saturday because I think a lot of us thought they would win that game seven typically the brewers have had one about two out of every three games at home this year\nThere was there for him I mean they made a great effort early unfortunately the Jeff from his home run which happened twice in the series and you know as much as I Love\nJay Jay ... you know some of that vote label hangs on him\nIvo disagree but when you score one run now yeah when you're going to do\nNo you're not going to you're not going to shut down the team as talented as a Dodgers game seven of the house yeah so that's number one of our foreign ... don't forget we haven't done this in a while what we're gonna be giving away pairs of tickets to see the Milwaukee symphony orchestra\nThe golden age of Hollywood Andre ... returns to present this incredible ... magnificent music on the silver screen the music of gone with the wind Citizen Kane Lawrence of Arabia but you got to pay attention\nYou got to get them right before I turn to for biggest stars we seen across marketing state in the world we made the number one easy because this is front and center you remind the brewers twenty Eighteen season\nComing up after the break number too sad story western Wisconsin the disappearance now week old story Jamie claws and a ... the latest on that story right here let me see answering\nThese really ten sixteen ounce GM's happy Monday everybody I Know we're getting over the brewers a\nLoss on Saturday but happy Monday as we know now it's

players on that team brand new Spicer forum it's pretty neat\nI heard during opening night on friday a lot of the TV there's ... billion TVs by the way anytime soon for him a lot of the TV had the brewer game on\nHaiti they get a message that who I Love the side right move yeah I Love the fact that the the teams all our franchising Wisconsin all kind of work together and get in and play well with each other just not the case everywhere else so\nGood stuff that was number one of our for us and number two a sad story bearing Wisconsin now week old Jimmy clause missing her parents were murdered in her home really not a lot of details are emerging about this case yeah and it's\nBeen seven days you write so Jayme cost remains missing after her parents were found shot to death in their home last Monday morning radio one news director Michael Dunkin' he covers several of the radio stations in western Wisconsin near barren where this took place he was on with the morning show this morning\nIf they know more than they told us a week ago they have it they've been keeping up pretty close to the vet and\nThey do say in fact the sheriff put out press release yesterday that they followed up non over a thousand tips that using every resource available that got multiple searches around the area conducted hundreds of the interviews that got state officials and the FBI could helping out\nAnd the FBI announced over the weekend that they put Jamie's story up on all the gas pump for a new things and nationwide billboards or in metropolitan areas across the country they also tonight [noise]\nHave a what's called a gathering of hope for Jamie closet is going to be at the middle school where she attended that starts at eight o'clock tonight in the city of barren really\nShe could be anywhere I mean the FBI put her to the top of their missing persons list as she could be anywhere in the country as far as we know they don't have a vehicle\nAs you can be out of the country who knows I mean she could be in Canada there's just no way to tell you know clearly\nI'm sure at least I Hope anyway and this is usually the case and we don't know everything\nThey're working on something they have a couple of tips that are either working out or they have knowledge on some other items that they picked up in the investigation so we do expect another news conference this afternoon around four o'clock\nIt may just be another standard up hey here's where we're at right now and not much further please keep calling in tips or maybe we'll learn something new\nYeah the chimps thing is important because it is to see something say something he was around me doesn't seem right you see someone that looks like Jamie\nPlease call in ... it's a little disconcerting than a week later we don't have a lot of information you're right maybe they\nBeing law enforcement ... have a piece of information that they can't release wearing a listener points in the right direction I Know there's a lot of folks that are working on this case I also supposed to live in that area and they say the communities on edge it's not a relaxed situation\nIt's interesting that us they're made that comment because gene asked that Michael Duncan this news director how are the emotions right now in that county\nIt varies some people are concerned some people you know don't really have a lot of emotion but there are certain number of people that are very anxious jak they set up a mental health hotline over the weekend down to one won in the in the local area here for people that were having trouble\nAround you know adjusting or trouble dealing with the situation and tonight at the gathering of hope they're also going to have mental health specialist there to talk to anybody that having anxiety or worries about ...\nYeah you can imagine a cut those killed in their home doors kicked down their daughter they're very young daughter middle school age is is taken we don't know what happened to her whether she dead or alive that is something that's going to cause consternation that community the job of of local leaders and law enforcement is the call\nOr the ... dead or alive that is something that's going to cause consternation that community the job of of local leaders and law enforcement is the column that as much as they can and great call what those mental health counselors on the ground making make them accessible to people\nEverybody needs help doing with this stuff has the as years they interviewed said everybody kind of process is a differently I saw that in Oak Creek and twenties well some people do well with it some don't but when you have a lot of uncertainty that causes anxiety to to to ramp up and that's something that everyone has to pay attention and killed\nTwo we had we spoke with a neighbor last week we listen Barclays spoke with one of the neighbors of the classes and she felt guilty because she heard the shots and wondered about it but didn't call nine one one right away and she can now is this internal struggle in her brain that she may have played a role in and she didn't of course not but like there's\nIt's amazing the um the range of emotions right now there\nYeah and that's again that see something say something is so important that you know anything about the case\nCalling the local authorities ... call uh nine one one if you if you have something that that is very very relevant and and it's important to the to the to ... finding a young woman a gym class it it is really important\nHere in our week away from her

Harris over the weekend already than already to Sanders today this is what it sounds to me\n[noise]\nThank you for that I say like hey I'm\nGoofy list the folks come not that I I'm not gonna disrespect the former president I actually got to know him a little bit during the twenty twelve to twenty fourteen times better get them on the show I was I shouldn't bring your mind for all those folks that say I don't\nBring Democrats I wouldn't have to add gets right former president All right so if you're one of his front people and you're doing your work and getting ready for that former president ... more than welcome on my show how 'bout that\nDoes that show that I'm willing to have that conversation and the civil manner I think it does Eric but this week is a who's who of people coming in Wisconsin to tell us how votes\n\nFrom what I Know of state representative del ... pretty smart guy and as a Republican I ... I Know he understands the issues and his great on policy\n\nThis stuff has to stop it's embarrassing to the state of Wisconsin It's not the same thing as Randy Bryce\n\nAgain voters need to be smarter need to be better listeners need to\nProcess the information that's out there a little more efficiently than we are doing right now for one for seven eight nine one six twenty see I can I'm always talking Tyson you want to weigh in on this more than happy to talk about it I'm On represent an acquaintance side you're going to say stuff like that then prove it if not\nIt's empty politics at its worst more than ...\nPercent more force needs to be with you on this Monday [noise] Jordan reminded me we have to avoid those ... symphony for tickets so let's do this\nCaller number trying to form on four seven nine nine one six twenty and get the uh for a ten correct and I gave it a couple of chances there I ran through him\nYou can win those walking Seventy or because you're taking someone to move on from the Tammy Baldwin a ranch actually to the Sandy Bob and ran and she she's not speaking at our socialist rally in Milwaukee so she is she uh she had us on the ballot socialist is how it works\nI'm at I'm asking Jordan um I ... I'd love to be able to um\nGo inside the minds of the people that are listening to this not these are clearly people that want to vote for tend to bomb they want to be there for they want to celebrates socialism liberalism at its finest\nI'm surprised she's not just pointing and everyone's saying you get a free car you get a free car you get free health care you get free health care whatever you want it's free I'm Tammy Baldwin please vote for me\nAs you're saying something like that I don't know but if she's having a socialist rally currently Bernie Sanders of course will be in town as well other famous us socialists fun with politics All right I'm going to shift gears completely\nAnd I wanted to talk about this last friday but we have the brewers are broadcast from the tailgate six twenty W teams in mobile studio um which was fun but as we speak there's like now seven thousand migrants\nMoving up through\nMexico border city of a few that has dogged though and this number keeps getting larger and larger and larger and they're they're awesome and mission is to get to the United states and I and I love the fact that he wants to come United States greatest country on earth\n\nBut this is the second time now that we've had this story line\nAnd I even Mexico officials are frustrated by the process they do do do these people and they they've had them since then they've kept him out as an because these people really want to get through Mexico to the United states they're crossing rivers are doing they're climbing fences\nAnd they're doing whatever they can to make that uh that track now the amazing thing about this was a couple of amazing things they have thousands of miles to reverse before they get from where the rats to the U.S border with Mexico\n\nThat's a lot of miles to walk the Mexican officials to their credit are trying to help elderly people children and women some of them were pregnant deal with the realities of life in those conditions\nSome of the some of the people have actually turned back and headed home because it just was so tough and why why is this happening while a couple of reasons one these people are facing violence in their home countries in South America Central America\nExtreme poverty because their governments have frankly screwed them up\nDon't provide for their own people\nNot doing what the government should do in its in its most basic sense help those people that need help that's the proper role of government not to do everything but to do the right thing\nBut the other side of this is something that has become a political talking point and it demonstrates lousy including the frustration a lot of us have when it comes to talking about immigration the border with Mexico and why\nRepublicans and Democrats have messed up that on this issue for so long\nNo clear immigration policy at least one that addresses this issue now you can think that it's great that people want to come here you can be one of those people the things we aren't border with Mexico should just be open and we should open her arms and accept everybody but that's not possible\nWe can't do that\nThere are limits to what we can do as a country and even if\nThat we do have in place which is flawed outdated\nAnd frankly hurts the process\nHas limits on it other countries Canada other countries in Europe are actively looking to update their immigration policy to deal with these types of issues because border crossings are happening all over the world because people are skipping violence in the middle east or violence in South America\nIssues because border crossings are happening all over the world because people are skipping violence in the middle east or violence in South America Central America that's the reality of the world we live in but we can't take everybody in\n\nAnd we're spending lots of lots of money trying to resolve this\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty to act in the markets talking to us for what should our government's reaction be to seven thousand or five thousand him or are migrants trying to get to to the United states what should we be doing\nOr should it be open arms spend as much money to improve their lives it sounds so great\nAnd the fairy tale world of Tammy Baldwin that sounds so\nComfortable and reassuring\nBut it's not the reality of the world we live here there are challenges to these problems because Republicans and Democrats haven't come up with a consistent clear enforceable immigration policy where at where we're at\nFort won four seven nine nine one six when it gets frustrating to me on a lot of different levels because I've been talking about this issue for almost two years\nI've had US Senators on the show congresspeople who said yeah we want to get to a solution\nAnd they all have their own ideas but they don't ever get to a solution one of the ... percent suddenly Canada\n... for the two six to line up our military in the bordering close the border the president has threatened dance\n\nWhich would be an extreme\nPosition given there's an election coming up in a couple of weeks\nAnd I know that Democrats would see them at opportunity because that's what they do\nTo portray this as another example of how Republicans are evil and racist and whatever other term you want to use when they're not really they're trying to provide some balance to a very difficult problem immigration border enforcement as one of the fundamental issues\nThat faces our country right now and for the most part\nRepublicans and Democrats have not resolved it and that's why we're at where we're at\nVery challenging times\nWhat would I Do the texture s\nI Would secure the border with military I Would do it as soon as possible because you cannot have a situation where thousands of people are streaming across that border in the ways that they do it\nWithout hearing people are dying children are dying women are dying elderly are dying\nThere has to be border security and it's it doesn't make anybody feel good that's the way you have to approach it I don't know what other solution there is given the challenges\nAnd the opportunity to do anything about it from a policy decision unfortunate times for those\nPeople coming trying to come across Mexico the United states more than actually going to be

call it but it is legit and I've done a story about on my TV work\nYou're fine for anything you want to do you want to go for perfection go for perfection but if I Would say are shown me\nOoh so I was eight Fifteen months ago whatever I find that I've dropped Seventeen points my before that I was only seven eighty compare so you see the movement movement each month so I went from seven eighty\nEight Fifteen that's movement or thirty five points and now down from eight Fifteen down to seven Ninety eight makes no difference\nIf I was in a different quiet during the movement or twenty or thirty points could make a big difference but once you've gotten to where you've really got\nYour bill payments being made on time every month you're using a low amount of your available credit you are absolutely golden I Know that lenders referred a golden\nBorrowers paying eight hundred or Bob but I'm not aware and I've not heard from any feedback from any lender being\nAt the numbers we talked about makes any difference in fact\nAt the numbers we talked about makes any difference in fact when I look at the psycho score scaling they list eight hundred or above in its own category\nWhich means you're also somebody who does everything else in life perfectly I guess me like I'm being in this upper tier\nThey mark seven forty seven Ninety nine but some lenders again would treat seven sixty seven eight nine year great All right so if you're not where you want to be\nNo that pretty much the whole game as two categories one\nBut he paid every bill every month on time\nI Know this is weird but I Know there are always people who don't have the money and can't pay bills but the biggest problem with not having bills paid on time as we forget\nMaybe our lives a little chaotic and we forget to pay so set up a electronic reminders of the bills you need to pay for if you're if you like paper right down every bill you have to pay him when it's too each month and then you make sure you've done that stuff\nAnd so that's more than a third of what makes up your score and the other part is just a hair under a third is don't use very much of the credit you have available to you I Know that sounds weird but the last of the credit you have available to use the higher your score becomes\nSo you do that stuff you're good Jordan joins us on the Clark\nHoward show Jordan cochlear great congratulations to you getting married\nYeah we're getting married in April actually\nWell that's great how can I be of service to you with your upcoming wedding\nLow after the wedding we are planning on selling the house that we're in right now and open and make about fifty thousand off of it which is which is pretty I I have a question about the capital gains tax I I think through what our research is the fact that\nYou know as long as you have been in the house two years or longer and you make a profit even as a single individual of less than a quarter million you just put the money in your pocket\nThat's nice I like that\nYeah isn't that great you know the rules for what happened when you sold a home used to be so ridiculously complicated and people without even tending to be tax cheats would mess it up and so but just by saying you have safe harbor\nUp to a quarter million single five hundred thousand married\nMade the process just so much easier to understand and easier for people to comply\nSo after apple we sell the house are going to actually do in a lot of the all the parents for a couple of months while we look for another house\nShow ... I had to plan to pay off a little bit in that with that money and then also I was thinking like said thirty five thousand that almost died or a ... percent town um the new hope to avoid\nBeing alive I light show way you're thinking yeah that that's what I can hear them ... church they still do kind of came to my head so it's what we said five right off the bat from that\nState that leaves us with twenty five\n[noise] my fiance has fourteen all alone or in a lab and grand less on her car\nBut also I Need a car so when I was thinking was not paying off her car and getting by and a car for a little flat out that way we don't have another loan and only\nNeed ... you don't want any loans opened up close to when you're going to buy a home I Love the way you thought about all this quaint surely there's no need to rush to pay off her car loan car loans extinguished themselves so quickly just with the number of months left to pay 'em off and you buying a car for cash\nIs a great idea wiping out or student loans a wonderful thought and then you still have the money to twenty percent down on a home loan I Want to congratulate you Jordan because the way you've thought this through is a great way for the two of you to start your marriage together\nJoyce joins us on the Clark Howard showing George you've been in the process of trying to steadily build up your credit straight to have you here on the car coward show tell me where you are right now in the process George\nWell I've already got on credit card got on with a major bank it honestly I'm probably after listening to the show recently probably thinking about this and that one but I Do want to have to also off of your eyes and um\nI mean you have a credit card with Wells Fargo\nYes it's I\nDon't dump that card because of all the ethical and legal issues that Wells Fargo keep that card because that's the only credit you have to have an annual fee attached to it\nYou know um it doesn't\nThen then I Want you to keep that Wells Fargo credit card and then once you go ahead and apply for another card\n'cause the grade you've already made it through the hardest stage of establishing credit which is having your first major credit card visa MasterCard discover American Express once you've got that\nAnd you handle paying it well and don't use a lot of the credit\nYou start building up a credit story that you can get that second credit card and to establish good credit you need a minimum of two major credit cards\nOkay do you run a balance on the wells Carter is it something you paying now Nobel\nI always I'm always paid it off before the payments to\nJapan and asked to build their car I then I Want you to go to a website called credit card to not OK\nAnd you'll be able to based on your charge pattern see what reward card you should get because if you pay your balance simple every month you should be not only building up your credit more but you should be getting rewards for it may have you set up a credit karma dashboard for yourself\nI have not now\nI'd like you to go do that and you'll be able to track the progress with your credit score over time in del suggest you is for you to do and use they'll suggest to you what credit moves you need to make to keep raising your score\nOkay and I would say get a second car now and then give it a half year\nAnd then at that point go back to credit card to not pick another card and then at that point don't dump the Wells Fargo card keep it open just don't use it anymore and then you'll have a much wider snapshot of credit for lenders to look at you'll be in great shape\nEdwards with us on the Clark Howard show hello ed were\nGood afternoon Clark how are you oh fine thank you know because you're doing well\nHaving a great day thank you\nGood

try to reduce east cost\nWell actually I Believe and there's something some people disagree with me strongly about I Believe the reason the University of just gotten so expensive is because of how

of them is annuities and you use another one mall because as you saw in the mall the prices are obscene\nThey are they're so expensive and I remember you lend a on your show you that your daughter get

country of Mexico [noise]\nI've been talking about local companies is was on a local company but they have a very strong local presidents that company is chick fillet we all know great chicken sandwiches\nI'm great food I was one of the restaurants that when I when I was in charge of the city of Oak Creek as mayor they also get a chick fillet get a chick fillet and we got a chick fillet and it's very busy very popular\nSo one of the challenges for these fast food places\nAnd this is not news by any means not breaking news but getting employees\nTo work in restaurants not just ... fast food restaurants all retail for that matter\nSo ... making a new bid in the fast food restaurant maybe it's not about the restaurant\nMaybe not a lot of brick and mortar store maybe it's just about getting their great food to you and your home so what they're proposing is these pilots have restaurants where they're devoted exclusively to delivery home delivery and catering orders\nSo no store no retail location where you can go buy chicken sandwich that those will still be out there\nBut a new way of looking at fast food but ... suggests people like to be at home look the popularity of home delivery of pizza why nots chicken or chicken sandwiches\nSo what they're looking at as these stores that don't have dining rooms\nThey have larger kitchens because it really about processing the food that they make they can serve vast areas they're all cash free customers have to use something called door dash or a credit or debit card\nYou can order directly from their mobile app they put these things by highways major roads in Nashville Louis Louisville right now to facilitate deliveries and there'll be a clear distinction between the regular restaurants I actually think this is the kind of a smart and bold idea and and given the difficulty of of getting employees\nIt makes sense to try different things this is just the newest version of that\nThey did a they did a survey to try to figure out what people think about restaurants and forty six percent said it'd be more inclined to take an order from a restaurant if there was a dedicated pick up air that's one of the things people said the twenty seven percent ... percent of people said they would order a take orders delivery right to their home\nThrough an app or delivery from a third party which is Thirteen percent as well so this off premise business stuff is really catching fire and again think about it lesser less employees less investment in the capital but it it takes to to hire train recruits\nPay those employees you can have a centralized location in a busy areas where you can just be constantly moving food around to people's home or their businesses and the case of the catering\nI said earlier with Kohl's looking for new opportunity with an existing retail markets that's the new wave I think of of innovation among retailers in restaurants\nI mean we've seen the explosion of home delivery for grocery retailers Amazon Meyer you name it I mean I think even picking say does some of that now\nClearly people have made a decision that their home is the universe we saw what film people sell them go to the movies but they really like watching movies in their home and they have these home entertainment centers in these grand TVs with great sound systems they can stream the movies they want to watch Netflix and one of the other services\nNow they can choose to eat the food that they want in their own home as well and we've always had that with pizza we haven't seen it in some of those other segments of that uh that restaurant business and now as McDonalds makes the shift\nChick fillet you wonder who else will be as part of part of that a new ... new reality or in a in business so for chick fillet the company's incredibly strong to private companies so they don't even released their sales figures\nBut the estimate is this is from tectonic research nine billion in sales last year nine billion three years ago five point eight billion\nYou had a company and you could make that kind of growth in that number of years you would say where where do we sign up and I know a lot of people who are fans of chick fillet they do things smart they understand their customers people are very brand loyal\nI think on that side of the business the chicken business they do pretty well\nSo what we see other restaurants and retailers doing this absolutely it's the new reality and I think it's something that uh\nWe should all pay attention to uh we are changing as a consumer society and I think that's going to continue and new innovative ways of doing business like chick fillet got him a shout out smarts grow your business grow your sector whatever it is\nHe brings up our best to visit

their way\nMarching up through the country of Mexico at least they've started at the the two thousand plus mile journey to get to the United states where the jobs are that's what they tell us at the same time they don't like the country they don't like the president's but yeah they want to be here so\nI wanted to take a quick survey this was going to be something that I Do I'm going to do on the show every day going forward we didn't take one of our topics and we're going to put a survey on Twitter you can find it at my Twitter handle W teams I Steve the question today should the president cut off aid to countries associate with the migrant caravan I'll give you the results\nBefore the end of the show right now it's looking about fifty eight percent say yes forty two percent no so we have countries\nAnd immigrants migrants who are on their way to the United states and as they are told us earlier in the foreign town this is a long journey one that will take months not weeks probably\nAnd the president has been pretty clear on this topic he's not messing around he said this on Twitter yesterday\nEvery time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats are not giving us the most to change our pathetic immigration laws remember the midterms so unfair to those who come in legally now Democrats have been pretty quiet on this because this does not play well\nIn their mid term elections strategy why\nBecause frankly a lot of Americans think this is nonsense and shouldn't happen and we shouldn't be even talking about the fact that we're just going to let thousands of people into the country trying to escape whatever issues they have in their home countries and and I asked the question before\nWhy don't they protest the leadership of their own countries like us citizens did in the American revolution towards the British why don't they do that they really feel so strongly about their home countries in their identity as citizens of those countries why don't you fight back\nIs that we have a care of them go to Jeff in while it tells you to be changing their morning Jeff\n[noise] yeah you hit the nail on the head you know these guys can be broadcasting their own country but you know my grandfather and his grandfather came over from Russia before you can hear you better or had a sponsor ... what happened to that\nYou know if that many presidents or a politician and let it slip through the cracks\nAlong with everything else we want to have happen these problems if we just followed our guidelines instead of what we have the problem\nUm people should not be right and remember nine nine eleven\nWho knows what's in there on your new at this morning and they showed a guy will fill up the truck or why you know hey are you on the job but if you wouldn't have been there it wasn't a halfway along with all the head you know you're putting your kid should danger we're not you know you come here\nLegally legally I nothing against people working here\nBut it's not the land of the free anymore you know\nWhile we can't we can't thanks for the call us if we can't just give things the way I look I I feel sorry for the people that are suffering that are suffering through horrific live so I Do and I think we should increase the legal entry of all those types of people around the world\nJust trying to escape from the things that my ancestors tried to escape from poverty in my case or in some cases now injustice or violence or terrorism I get all that\nBut there's a process and the reason this breakdown has occurred is because both Democrats and Republicans have screwed around with this process for too long\nThey have not found a solution from the two sides to on the African Americans talking tax lion cut off aid why the u._s. always the bad guy and immigration seven thousand Wisconsin night's march the Canadian border no paperwork and demanded a right to answer I Would bet\nThey would get denied entry and get no bad press from the media I'm tired of this left the narrative there is a legal way for the people answering United States people need to start following the law and I think when the two six to that's how people are feeling that's why the Democrats are leaving this topic a loan\nFrom dean from the two six to we're robbing people their ability to be successful successful on their own merits\nLook this here's another Texan from nine to all of this country gives other countries ungodly amounts of money impose our will and so that it that give it the hard working Americans Americans first the amount of money we're talking about\nIn central and south America's about five hundred million dollars half a billion dollars\nIs not insignificant\nOne wonders if that money that we're providing to these countries the Guatemala Honduras other countries is actually getting to the citizens that we're trying to help\n\nAnd if it's not getting their why do we provide the money if you're going to ask me today if the president should cut off aid absolutely otherwise\nThis caravan problem this migrant issue is going to continue to be an issue with our country first two thousand and five thousand now reports uh seven thousand on its way to ten thousand we can't feed and house everybody on the planets\nAnd I'll go back to my original question the countries in question here if you're angry about the course or the future in your own home country why don't you do something about that\nFor one for seven nine once it's one of the African Americans talk in Texas I don't forget weighing on Twitter at WGM Jay Steve\nShould the president cut off aid to these countries who are sending these migrants through Mexico\nThey think she's not as states to get jobs I don't think that's going to happen what do you think you can weigh in there also in the African Americans talk and talk to and most of the taxpayers are saying yes

B. so blind that they don't understand\nHow wrong it is to allow somebody who is convicted of a felony convicted not even just charge but convicted of a felony including but I Would argue is a crime of violence to be participating in extra curricular activities\nI completely agree and I could have thanks for the safety of everyone on the [laughter]\n[noise] yeah well thanks so I mean I don't I don't know that it's so much I don't know that it's so much that necessarily but you you do wonder I mean I have a text here a kid with bad grades can't play yet a convicted felon Ken I'm yes yes that's exactly what the what the rule is Jeff where is your logic oh yeah it's common sense that's one of our text\nYou know ... ... exactly and I mean I mean the W. I. A. W. I. A. I think realizes how ridiculous this rule makes them look\nSo they're in the process of at least considering a change to the constitution which would make ... for any W. I. H. tournaments a student athlete who was charged or convicted for ... well you would think\nBut of course the the way the W. I. A. operates it's like turning a giant ship it takes years to get stuff done so they're not going to consider this time for this kid and and who knows what they're going to do moving forward but right or wrong\nI guess it is just stunning to me that you can be a convicted felon and can be participating in high school athletics and I am sorry you will never convince me that there are not double standards here\nAnd that if you weren't talking about this case\nA a very very talented gifted basketball player\nBut rather somebody who I don't know didn't have skills for example that might lead to the NBA or to a college scholarship I got to wonder whether this would be a completely different set of circumstances Christian new Berlin Christian WTO O. J. hello\nGood afternoon what do you think I Am I'm a conservative person here but I'm actually at Grand\nOr ... what do you think why it's so that would actually caught second chance here taking away her career etcetera\nYou're actually at work all pro shut casual wear on and you're out but\nI Love your very shortly but they don't show that you actually [laughter] oh\nWell let me let me let me let me ask you let let us say\nThat you you instead of talking about a a star player you're talking about a guy like me who had very limited athletic talent okay so I Would ever however I was going to make my living it wasn't going to be you know playing basketball or baseball or anything like that are are are you saying that for me it would be okay to not let me play\nBut for the talented guy we make an exception for him\nPretty much what you're doing it or the person or career\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [noise] well\nOkay but let's work on that so let's say my talent I I'm On my talent isn't going to be in basketball it's not going to be athletics but maybe maybe I've got the potential to be a lawyer for example will ... conviction is probably going to keep me out of law school should we\nShould we forget about should we forget about that that felony convictions probably going to limit me and all sorts of different ways is it fair to treat me like that but again give the athletes the special consideration\nStill around are quite yet but [laughter] [laughter] oh God okay [laughter]\nWell my second chance really\nRare or we will you\nCouldn't okay thanks took on air pollution and ensure that and I get that I don't agree with you but I think that's the argument I I I get that that's the argument that this this young man if something special it was my forwards learn how to dunk\nSo since you know how to dunk we're going to be able to treat you in a different way but I Do wonder what does that say to all the other student athletes out there who are not convicted of felonies you know what does it say to them and again this this is a broader conversation because the truth of the matter is\nThe the young man is being governed by the rules that were in place\nAt the time that he committed the crime was subs will be convicted of the crime so I understand that he gets to play but my argument would be nobody similarly situated should ever moving forward be able\nIf you waited should ever moving forward be able to play Jan in Sheboygan January there'll be T. M. J. lo\nColonel totally disagree with that and how is it if you ever done\nIt actually brings your school choice\nTo go out and you decide how that's going to go back here you are going to be able to fight that yeah I I Am from white only read that I found out as a high honor that he was a\nFreshman or sophomore year\nWhen we went right right I mean that's what I feel like you're basically saying oh well I\nKnow you're there for people\nWell I mean I ... I guess I just keep going back to this idea\nOf of or somebody in high school who is convicted of a felony then that's where\nWe're not even talking about charge now we're talking about convicted of a felony and what I Would consider to be a serious type a felony\nAnd they're going to be continue ... I guess I've you extra curricular activities whether it's banned or debate or basketball I view that as a privilege and the idea\nThat both that MPs and within the WMBA apparently being a convicted felon at least at this point in time isn't enough to permanently disqualify you from high school athletics\nWhat's wrong with that picture\nTwelve twenty eight track record WTO O.

President Trump is being pounded for for being a war monger and this is terrible and you're going to get us into World War three and all that stuff by pulling out of this accord\nMy point is if Russia isn't following this and there doesn't appear to be any issue that Russia hasn't been following this accord for at least the last part of that for at least a decade\nAnd is now getting bolder and bolder to the extent that they are re deploying missiles why in the world with the U.S not pull out of this so that they could respond accordingly when one party is violating the agreement\nTo continue to bind yourself by it seems to me to be ridiculous now I Am not arguing necessarily that this means that the u._s. should start rolling out you know mid level cruise missiles in Europe I I I don't know about that\nBut I Do know that at least in my opinion it's ridiculous for the U.S to continue to be bound by an arms control treaty that Russia is ignoring\nAm I missing something for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the second mortgage talk an ex line\nCan President Trump getting all sorts of heat for being a war monger oh my gosh how can you pull out of this agreement well if Russia is not following the agreement what is the sense of continuing to be bound by something why continue to pay the dog Walker for thirty minutes you know he or she is only walking your dog pretense\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nLet's see I get it or get you talk and text line what do you think we discuss next twelve forty four ... will be the object\nGrab your sweater on that pumpkin spiced latte\nFollow is temperatures moving into the area watching at home ... news radio WGM Jay you're a Hong\nKong is\nOn Jay and\nThis is kind of ... when I have exterior door needs I reach out the Wendy climbing order of Jay and be construction provider of high quality exterior home improvement products and services for over sixty years\nI might be kind and gardening and you actually tell you the guy is one of the quickest way to make a first impression giving a design that what compliment your homes architecture along with adding a flash at color will help increase your homes ...\nNew improved ex care products had exceptional overall durability ... happy and improve security which can create an ancient cat if not only attack has such functional\nFor more information entry doors call waiting ... to ... to ... for three seven zero five three seven or visit Jay Z construction dot\nWe all\nThe spring\nOn James van\nGogh rock and rock's Wisconsin's afternoon news with John rash your [noise]\nHall\nOf famer Larry my camera\nPersonally afternoons at free choice to have you on every single day if we could well thank you are the two actually feel warm and fuzzy sponsored by ... plus we're about Harlem with like Green Bay Packers in Nineteen twenty nine WGM jak [noise]\nHelp us raised living and he was going to cause any harm\nExperience a lot\nOn during nine eleven victims of the goals are permanent I Will also be an educational center and the place to honor the U.S military hope\nPeople will come they're not only\nLearn about bringing their kids ...\nMemorial will forever give meaning to the word never forget and more information had the WGM\nJay ...

that and it was nothing doesn't even have to face per week um that was kind of a frustrating situation the brewers are gonna have a load of arms available next year and decisions to make no this is assuming they don't make any moods\nYeah Jimmy Nelson we assume he's going to be back Chris Anderson is still in the mix memory with the best started the brewers had in twenty Seventeen I think we'd Miley probably comes back you'll Esau seen still under contract Peralta burns wardrobe\nYou still have ... babies\nI mean you're loaded here and it's not a matter of you know finding a guy who can go eight innings\nYou know a couple of times a month I don't think credit councils philosophy is going to change that third time around a lot of that's a big deal he does not like pictures facing a line up three times showed up time and time again in the playoffs why that can be risky\nAnd only the true bona fide aids is really are are going deep into games and I don't think the brewers could afford that to be honest with you got a few more phone calls will grab them on the other side here brewers baseball harder to win season very impressive never been done before\nA disappointing end over the

where am I going to play or where to go back to my work\nBecause it could afford a I think it I think it's really good management and I think it's really good and it worked and we're going to I think we have to do it again\nFor the phone call and you know it's it's a it's a tremendous point and I think it is spot on\nThey had the brewers punk down thirty million for ... or whatever that number was or if Clinton curse off thirty five million why that fits on a hundred and Ninety nine million dollar payroll\nBut it doesn't really fit as well on a brewers payroll that is always going to be less far less\nThan some of the big market club so what do you do well if the threat to the theme of the bulk then you find the value starter might the brewers didn't believe so I've seen your stack your bullpen with a bunch of guys who can miss bats which plays very well in the playoffs any role\nIs what the brewers did and you might see this developed with other small market teams in the major leagues where it's not a it's not devaluing starting pitching it is trying to find pieces that work in your system\nYeah it's hard to say the brewers didn't maximize the contract values on their roster right I I think they did maybe a better job than any other team in baseball and doing it\nRight and I heard of that that over the course of the of the birth scored one more run down the doctors that like the pitching did its job if are often had been able to do anything and came for or game seven when the series\nI don't think it was the pitching problem and for like\nI personally over the course of the beginning there was very much skeptical of the ... kind of not doing a great job and by the end of the season I'm a complete convert like\nI think it was brilliant what he was doing like a wave Miley pitching to Cody Ballenger just set up day Robert wind up and like get him back the next day that kinda stuff I thought was just genius outta council that if they can\nKeep doing that kind of stuff maximizing their pitching and get some more consistency that often I think that's what pushes them over\nYeah thanks for the phone call Alex I was fascinated I was totally fascinated ... playoff baseball manager of the play offs it's a little different than the regular season you're going to take more gambles you're going to\nIn the case of a game seven managed for nine innings and and that's your season that's what you're managing for you have to win that game to continue it might be a little different on a Tuesday night in may when you're opens a little beat up and even if a guy's getting crushed you just kind of have to leave him out there\nI didn't see much of that ... throughout the course of the season I was fascinated I was more intrigued by the end of the season I was more intrigued that who's the number two pitcher in a given game was going to be versus the starter disorders name was on paper and it kind of gas through the second guy was going to be that was fun\nWell thinking about it this way this is what council does I think just about as well as a manager and he looks at when it looks ahead of time because he has to win already highly highest leverage situation is going to come up their time around me or any of the second time around of or around the order that's when he decided okay that's what my best pitchers need to get in the game and start doing what they need to do\nIt you know it sucks man hater had to go in the third inning and game seven but that was his plane was when it's time to go and you're going to go in and he did what his\nJob you know I was thinking about this and I was kind of half ... half not when I said it I had a lot of people wonder when when you always see look by you getting hit a little bit hard and okay haters up in the bullpen looks like he's going to come in reverse had one or two runners on base and Jonathan scope was the pinch hitter\nAnd a lot of people ask me why scope here why not Santana\nAnd I'm thinking to myself All right well you know same town as a a bat you want to have face you know a reliever in a in a given situation it seems like a good situation for Santana\nMy honest thought was maybe ... council just wild thought here\nKnows that Jonathan scope isn't going to get a hit buddies eating in the picture spot so you maximize Josh heater by putting done it in scope at the point that they get to hit rate you might get a couple of runs hundred percent making it out you're going to get three innings of hate her 'cause the spot will be do so long as the Dodgers starting pitcher stays on fire and walk or below it was pretty good\nRight at your your minimizing into one like you know you think that I Love\nWas half kidding but then I'm like well maybe there is some truth to that I don't know I just but that's the kind of thing you go through thinking about\nBut that's the kind of thing you go through thinking about who they're going to get three innings on a heater now watch this\nBecause I Do is go sitting in the future spot there's no way he's going to get a hit you'll get your maximize hater outs more important than runs I don't know but this is what is so intriguing you start thinking about all this different stuff\nI loved it it was taxing it was intriguing it was fascinating I'm happy it all happened I mean it was unbelievable to walk really really cool and interesting stuff\nAnd when he was a smaller market in baseball you have to get a little creative any uh certainly cannot say ... we're not creative they definitely work so I can ask for made moves in the team was in it they better the roster production of a young guys\nAnd you're hoping for the same next year if not better pretty amazing stuff more brewers talk later in the program in a
