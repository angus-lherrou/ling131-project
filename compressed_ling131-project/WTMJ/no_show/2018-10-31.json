'cause you might forty AM et cetera we said no\nYeah I I I don't know if they're from the outset of not I'm not a hundred percent sure I Know from a technical standpoint but I think the plan is to sign will cast everything from the start and then uh I think a program a lot of good will get figure it out eventually I don't want to speak out attorney here\nBut I understand I just wanted to I Know it's got a little bit off topic I Apologize\nNo that's fine I think that's the exciting stuff I think this is great stuff for a\nFew that they had heard about this kind of a couple of months ago so it's great that is coming to fruition I think that gay or you know I think the fact is a great but we're the numbers and you can correct me Iran but why his numbers really ... for the city\nIn bulk of his you know ... and all that I mean it was a great deal that started coach shot back where you belong to third base\nAnd they said there was a prayer that the birds were after I might be reaching here I don't know if the catcher from Tampa Bay or if it's Murphy that the cubs fan and I don't know how it is a pre again or not but\nI mean the great at second base so Thanks Greg I appreciate it keep up the good work product\nYeah preaching rubbish have second year and uh I I don't know if Daniel Murphy knees are going to allow him to do much more in major league baseball\nYou know if you want to move back to third that's cool and you know it's certainly a much more reasonable option in terms of cost and you have to solve the issue at second base what do you do there and unfortunately you had the injury to Mauricio do bond or a young sort of rising star in the system I know people are Gaga overcast\nAnd hero he's never hit a triple a pitch yet right I mean there there's the pump the brakes a little bit I don't think that's a starting second base option for the brewers next season you might see in at some point but I don't think you break camp with casting hero on the twenty five men roster I just don't see that happening\nI think I like Microsoft is I really do think it's a pretty good player I think he's a great clubhouse it I think is a good defender\nMaybe with a full season his numbers that the plate in terms of power will be better and I thought he came up big and some big moments I thought he struck out a ton especially in the playoffs\nSo what's your cost what's your twice a year if you're David Stern you let me grab a sharply fine at second base is better than advertise\nRight behind him but he's a he's a smart enough and good enough and reactive when a field or where he figured out his position and with time give them a spring training at second base he could play probably every middle and feel to any any infield position if you give them a spring training as far as me soccer's goes if you give them let's just let me throw the number here instead of the one fifty what you're not going to do what about\nThree at thirty like his are too would want to use in that too much or is that a that is probably a good breaking point ten million\nWell he's definitely looking multi year um\nYou can point to the ten million well he's definitely looking multi year I'm ... and maybe it's two years with some sort of option I don't know I'm sure the player wants three years of a team wants to do to [laughter] you know what I mean it's just kind of how it works and somehow you end up meeting in the middle or whatever the middle of two and three years\nAnd what's your best infield\nWhat's your best infield then can you get it can you make it work at the start of the season because the president filled up and started the season was very different than their best infield at the end of the season or their platoon players during the middle of the year we're Brad Miller Nate orphan Tyler ... you know\nAnd then all of a sudden they're two players became premier Shaw I just I mean look what the team ended up being versus what it was\nA member of the conversations we had about Ryan Braun first baseman and that just went out the window that what about if that went out the window\nWith a bag of ours emergence is really what happened I'm In bronze laid find defensively especially out of left field\nI don't know I I'd I'd love to see moose back just because I liked him so much I think the numbers are just kind of okay\nIt's okay you know what you're getting there and I wouldn't expect much more than a a two fifty to sixty hitter\nBut if you have the power to go along with it\nAnd ah he was ultimately the guy trade it for Jonathan skills so I don't know the situation is much different than that\nI mean scope heading nine games threats were you was incredible that was with Baltimore and he was the AOL player of the week that was it you had a nine games threats that was a season\nAny one great moment with the brewers in ... defeated the giants a grand slam on Madison Bumgarner but I mean this is going to hit a ... year to Ninety three thirty two bombs a hundred and five are beyond your twenty Seventeen\nAnd it was just\nPoof gone\nWhen he got through the brewers and really it was during the course of time the season he was injured at an oblique injury got hot for nine games was treated\nYou know it just wasn't there so we use under control costs of eight and a half million the brewers would have to enter a contract and then he goes to arbitration which means he comes back for more than eight and a half million\nI just think it's too big of a price to pay for a guy who didn't produce [noise]\nGot a handful of calls on the on the line we will get back to this discussion a little bit later in the weekend or it'll be interesting to see what the brewers do with Jonathan scope still plenty more brewers

M. J. [laughter]\nTime to time we don't know why you're dealing with the head coach of the box\nMy student holes or every one of them deal with coach fun and this is courtside with the Milwaukee Bucks\nThere is a buzz across the state tonight\nThe bugs are off to a blistering start on this new NBA season seven or no the bugs are the only um defeated team in the league\nAnd folks you have to turn back it was one forty seven years in the days of Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul Jabbar to find a time in franchise history when the team as one seven straight right on the blocks\nKnow try to explore courtside Milwaukee Bucks\nWhich you're no stranger to winning no stranger to winning streaks I'm sure you remember your Nineteen game winning streak with the Atlanta Hawks back in the fourteen Fifteen season or is it harder to keep a young team like the bucks focused in practice and focused on the next game when you're on this kind of a role\nI you know I mean if they do so early in the states that and um you know certainly great and exciting for everybody to you know be off to establish an all star but the the focus then I think the understanding of how early we are and how early we are\nKind of learning how we want to play it and what's important to us a let's talk this feels like it's been a good place than um does and you know I think that's coaches we always looking for things to worry about is turned ourselves them or you could always be better but uh and I think the focus has been a good place and you know hopefully we can keep it that way going forward\nLeaders keep talking about your system and if they just trust the system and stick with the system it will be very dangerous team for for the average fan out there who do you just in layman's terms describe your system in a few words\nYeah you know I mean I think probably you know that's the last what a lot of people are kind of you know I think\nTalking about and ... they don't care about and I you know I think the most basic layman's terms there's you know we want we want a lot of people move meant a lot of ... but it was so well hopefully you're staying five guys that are\nYou know moving and partying and screening and applying without the basketball um which is\nYou know sometimes not prominent MBA um and then you're staying hopefully you know players that are um playing very selfish play you know with the ball boat but so are the people are moving and that also is very layman terms the hopefully the ball is moving\nThrough the ... the people that you're creating advantages and you're creating opportunities\nUm play in a very random kind of way um but with ... players are understanding you know read the decisions and opportunities and taking advantage of them\nSpeaking you taking advantage of opportunities that I don't want to ... minutes time together to pass without talking a little bit about John Ensign\nWas known it up fish fry the other night and it was ended up talking to a a bucks fan and he said are you going to talk to the coach again this week and I said yep usa will would you ask him this who are you and what have you done with John Ensign\n[laughter] yeah no I well first I thought I heard the fish fries the Milwaukee you're a big deal products so I got a I haven't had my first\nOf all that stuff's ... sooner is my first fish fry but uh oh you got to do though charge going to do that\nYeah that's for sure I'm excited about how does it have to fly again\nYou know I think he's enjoying this this you know as we said that you know an opportunity to grow an opportunity to maybe you know drop it game expand his game and you know not forget about what makes them special and unique I think his shop walking in the fans are really really good really really helpful to us\nI think he's an underrated pastor an underrated caught up in a better understanding how the ... best work and can keep the ball moving and generate second action third action with them\nUm becomes a real threat as it got rolling for law the dog though but then he's also get an opportunity to space to court and fix the three of them make 'em then it's been a it's been great if they have more in and really trying to\nGrow and uh and improve uh you know despite being of the late for you know nine or ten years so that's what a lot of our fire development a lot of our belief as we can hope these guys go and get better\nI think I might actually buy you a fish right with that answer coach [laughter] I'm at you go\nOh another thought oh and it'd be interesting in your reaction to this it appears to me watching the games but even though you don't it's just putting a monster numbers when he was the eastern conference player of the week last week\nA match day wilt Chamberlain record in the first four games of the season for both points and rebounds\nIt just seemed like he doesn't feel like he's got to carry the team on his back and remind you use that an accurate observation\nYeah I mean I think uh you know the roster and and how we feel and I think I got it builds about you know the same as\nUm yeah we want everybody to be tough but if we want everybody to feel like they're participating in a port and roll and\nUm I think you oughta says enjoying that and I think he feels that I think it's just going to make ... an even more special flair and even better player and so I think it's a wet away for everybody I think ... that's going to be a better going forward and uh you know the group around him going to play with more cough and ask them\nI'm afraid that the slaves to a success for everybody\nSaw an interesting statistic the other day and I just wanted to get your reaction statistics that you know can sometimes be very misleading\nBut this particular analysis of the books actually had greener all sense of a fish and see when you on this was on the bench much greater decent some fish until you when he was playing as opposed to when he's on the bench your thoughts on that\nYeah you know I think I Know one of my assistant coaches the headmaster that so many and shared it with me also and you know one thing I Will stay there so early in the states that and and the sample sizes\nAnd how the analytic and these guys that are you know just the ones that are twice or three times as hard or soft and trying to help us\nGet smarter a you know they always talk about small sample size but I think we should talk about that but also you know I think it's a huge compliment to you know the whole roster but especially Chris metal so I think\nThe way he played the first six or seven games them the efficiency with which Chris as quiet as dispense phenomenal um and so you know sometimes\nWe try and keep it where at least ... starcraft on the court you know at all five of them and so you know some of those times while you oughta without uh you know there's been more oh that's probably a little more emphasis on press them\nIt's just been incredibly a fish or um you know in the small sample size and\nSo I think back to speak to it I think you know the teams playing with top guys are playing with a lot of comments\nAnd then the thing you know and the other end the defense of addict speaks to how special yacht as soon as the festival and how he packed the game defensively and we're really trying to emphasize that with the audience how he can change things defensively so you know I think it's a huge positive to be um you know how good we are without us they're active and engaged\nSpeaking to produce it looked like he took just control of the game and a part of the fourth quarter last night\nYeah now he has this knack that uh you know I'm I'm getting\nFrom our Web and\nTimes and different games but you know he'll just said you know a few big shots of and I've said a couple of times they get taught shop and and we don't want to take a lot of tough shot but if the NBA and the defense those are good and the players incredibly athletic and\nSometimes you have to have a player on your same that can make tough shot and crushed certainly is one of those guys them you know it just changes games when he pops two or three raised in a row and especially if one or two of them are you know you have good defense better\nEspecially if one or two of them are you know you have good defense better off um those are just waiting for your phone at the um you know Chris what's been phenomenal\n... ability last night or more with so much more than a moment this was courtside with them all the bumps on WGM joy\nYou can give them the same old same old cameras unique from Saint Paul Peirce you are\nAbout getting a gift shop you'll find that\nI mean he didn't get\nAlways have a law\nYou ... you know I I mean I may when you're getting lightning and plenty Lincoln\nYou deserve to get it fixed right the\nTime this is great mental qualities were the management Dan is rigorously

Gail ... had minute intervals or you don't want to record side with social clubs do ... do the fan energy has been terrific advisor for them what are your impressions so far I've been to a real\nOh it's been great you know and I think most importantly that you\nMentioned there's the fans you know the energy to the ball you know it's just so great to be in the arena\nYou know we'd go on a raw and we make a couple of stops defensively we block shall we get a big board we go the other end somebody makes a shot or drive Spanish to them\nYou know you just feel the energy and feel the crowded um it's just such a great to have a home court advantage by by there for them and I think everybody talked about the manatee feel how great it is so yeah I couldn't be more happy you are with the arena with fan\nOthers had received breath compensation but they're not actively seek a trade for any of those guys so this is sort of new territory here in Green Bay ... his first trade deadline as she ever the Packers he gets rid of a distraction in the locker room what time of gum or he could quickly become\nAny moves on from a player who in my opinion he had no intention of signing for the long term beyond\nThis season so it just kind of guessing here had Hassan ... walked away and free agency what would the Packers compensatory draft pick have banned my guess is that it would have been a fourth round her in twenty twenty\nBy actually going to the trade with Washington the Packers get a fourth round or in twenty Nineteen so I think the compensation is reasonable\nYou'd love to get a little greedy and say boy that should be a third round or golden tape the wide receiver for the lion's you got a third round pick effects the third round her\n[noise] um but you're also looking at a guy in putting Dick too I didn't have any years control beyond this year there's no guarantee that he ended up back in Washington so you might just play you know seven or eight games and that's it that's it for ... Washington Redskins\nThey may choose to resign of who knows but you run the risk you get into that rental employers sort of category where players contractors expiring and uh you know that doesn't really help\nThe Packers causes they're seeking draft compensation are coming up on the other side of the way to get your thoughts in in what you feel about the movie was made by the Packers today it's certainly new territory I think for a lot of Packer fans were used to Tom Ford's way of doing business\nA B might want to sit down before I mentioned that Brian good a good will be addressing the media tomorrow at ten twenty\nSome people just really wouldn't do during the course of the regular season so that to his new uncharted territory\nSo it'll be interesting to hear his comments coming up a temp twenty tomorrow McCarthy will address the media ten thirty to most of the big media day in Green Bay Aaron Rodgers expected to speak as well and uh it'll be split by the conversation on the patriots\nAnd a lot of conversation on the ... made today by the Packers we'll hear from one of the guys moved former Packard safety ha ha Clinton Dix our conversation after this on WGM Jay\nWayne

rules of the game of booking a place to sleep\nAnd I want to address something that I have long been very opinionated on and I was reminded by by two stories I've seen recently about employers\nViewing employees surveys and saying they're anonymous and then\nLater well it was an anonymous at all this happened to as well as a customer when you're asked to fill out a survey and often it will turn out not to be anonymous at all at places\nOf work when you're asked to fill out an employee survey\nAnd some places push for one hundred percent participation and someone will come to you and say hey you haven't turned in your employee survey our NATO most could that survey be\nIf they know who has a turn one even think about that\nAnd think about how somebody could decide well we've toys somebody off from the department and you know Jim\nDidn't seem very happy from the survey must give him the boot\nAnd so the cause of the fact that employers can be dishonest or deceptive or even at a supervisory\nLevel based on a number of responses supervisor may successfully be able to guess even with an anonymous survey who filled it out\nWhen you're asked to fill out a survey at a place you work unless you don't care if you get to keep your job or not\nWell that was what I was looking to understand you know it's got a twenty thousand dollar limit a average monthly spent on this card is about five ... and it's been paid on time for you know years and years and years so it definitely is in good standing\nIdly I Believe it be and you know right now I have a mortgage lender and the underwriting department said ooh Ryan you got too much available credit we're worried about that\nThat would be the point at which you would check with your parents see if you are impacting authorize user could also be an error and credit reporting\nMajor listed and so that would be the only reason you would want to have it removed is some times underwriters a mortgage lenders will say we don't like how much available credit you have to worry about their new home you don't charge up everything\nAnd that really be why you would would remove yourself\nBut other than that leave it alone\nOkay very good so you basically take action if they say that you know those limits are too large but do you see my score swinging a drastically if in fact I Do are moving in the future\nWell it depends very very utilizing twenty five percent of their available credit\nRoughly a that's a good ratio anything below thirty it really is helpful to you\nAnd with the credit you have you want to make sure you're never using more than thirty percent of your available credit if you're using substantially more than that\nThen that credit line your parents have may actually be giving a booster that portion of your credit report that is thirty percent of your score if you're pattern with credit utilization is very good don't worry about it\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard

[laughter]\nI'm not a one way of life you crazy trying to ...\nI'll be doing that for a year but\nCompared to like if you go to a commercial shredding service figure you're going to pay like a dollar a pound\nTrout I so I two or three hundred dollars of what's going to cost me\nYeah so I Would rather see you buy a a shredder that allow you to do what we might called medium volume shredding I have one that I bought for it was like fifty nine dollars that I can cram like twenty sheets and the time\nAnd it may or an awful racket and my kids have gotten too old now but I used to pay my kids to shreds for me and they thought they were making a fortune when I'd give him a dollar to to do it about that yeah so do you have any kids can rent them the sharia or you had a\nChoice I got a transit twenty five year old so I don't know if it's because of that\nYeah that's ... that's not an age where you pay a dollar or two [laughter] so I guess a ... or ... you need to have some mindless TV on and just sit there and shred stuff one after another\nSounds like that\nBecause you said you had hundreds of pounds right\n[laughter] yeah at least two or three other adults\nYeah that's 'cause that's hundreds of dollars you don't wanna\nPay that kind of money to pay a commercial try to do and sometimes credit unions will have a shredding day try to attract new members were they'll shreds stuff for free but I don't even know how you find out when credit unions are doing those free shredding days\nWhat a neat idea Tim is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sam how ya doing\nVery Well Howard thanks\nWell great to have you here you have a question for me about home insurance is that right\nYes I Do I like to purchase a condo or town hall for the Los Angeles county\nLike concern here is that showed an earthquake happened and the entire building are complex isn't covered by the earthquake insurance the the owners association that I could possibly lose all my equity and my unit and even not have a place to live as well\nYou are correct so we didn't usual in a condominium that they would go with euphemisms Scully called self insured to rebuild the buildings for uh the aftermath of an earthquake okay\nSo when you're looking at a condo you can request from the seller ... they provide you all the documents on the condo association and they have to supply you that if you requested including you want to see what kinds of reserves the condo has\nAnd if it's not disclose do you want to know what kind of insurance coverage they have in in addition with that there's a crazy thing with condos have you on the condo before\nYou know I have not\nSo Tim this is one that's like freaky weird okay\nLet's say there was forget earthquake let's say there was a um a fire or some event that caused significant damage to the building and it had to be rebuilt each condominium\nDecides in their bylaws what they're responsible for and the homeowners you still have to have like a condo owners policy and you got to make sure the condo owners policy you get matches up\nWith where it takes over where the condo association policy leaves off\nSome of them might have even reach sheet rock your condo and leave that to you after a destructive about\nOthers might include flooring others might not include new foreign it's not like a traditional homeowner's policy you're condo owners policy\nHas to be written so that it doesn't leave gaps between what the condo association coverage is and what your policy would cover now and the earthquake\nYou so you don't know yet if the condo association has earthquake insurance\nI Do not I I look to see if they do and as you mentioned it is extremely rare that a choice they would have a earthquake policy for the entire complex very

homeowners insurance\nYes we have been with a company for thirty three years\nAnd we just got a letter of non renewable effect in January third on our homeowner's insurance [noise]\nMust have made a claim\n[laughter] well we did we um we had a ...\nUh two years ago and it was a water heater and um I was really in close contact with the agency asking for them to kind of you know diets on how much we absorb or you know file\nAnd then uh this summer we had a refrigerator language that took out or wood floors and um that was you know both of them are totally unexpected both were totally resolved it they treated us really well and the claim resolution process\nAnd gave us no indication that we were going to get hit with this letter and um basically non renewable\nGenerally with homeowner's insurance the phrase the industry uses is use it and we lose it\n[laughter] yes ...\nThirty three years before these uh claims he hadn't back to back when you said two years ago and then recently how many claims that you ever had against the homeowner's insurance and the prior thirty one years well\nWe have had three different we've lived it for different homes in three different states and we had no claims on any of those previous homes we in this home for ten years and unfortunately had for\nA December when we first moved here and there was one water issue with the water here line and then we had a catastrophic health arm and repeat it to be replaced\nSo that was the first one is two thousand six with the water line in the water heater and\nThen I Know that's a long time ago to ask you this do you have even the famous memory how much that claim was\nYeah I have it right here because they told me what it was and I'm In the water heat it was two thousand three hundred and eleven dollars and so we shouldn't even filed that back we asked them and they didn't really seem to give us any good direction on you know how to make that call\nWe had a thousand dollar deductible at that time I'm In the last two years we after deductible too I think it was half a percent into like Eighteen hundred dollars\nAnd um so they only paid out twenty three hundred you know way back in two thousand six\nSure All right let me tell you the cold hard facts here and this is you are such a positive person by the way well most people would be just like steaming and you're so positive and upbeat about this but the reality is\nThat homeowners insurers many of them if not most of them judge you now based on a number of claims rather than the dollar amount of the claims and it doesn't even matter that you've been with them thirty three years\nIf they decided that recently you become a frequent claiming they don't want you\nAnd so it's a double whammy because now you have do you know you have something called a clue report\nI just found that out he s so and we\nReport um follows the house not you write\nSo even when you go to sell your house somebody coming to buy it may have a hard time obtaining homeowner's insurance because they've ah put you through the clue process\nAnd when you go to buy now you're going to have three years of having to buy substandard homeowner's insurance that will basically just pay to rebuild your house in a catastrophic boss\nOkay well we I have called around and talk to an insurance broker that deals with eighty agencies and several of them just right out of the gate refused to write us because of the last we had a preferred rating insurance score which meant that we were just spotless um until the cruise kicked in and we had those two that showed up\nSo it looks like our insurance is going to double um because of that\nGoing to be crummy coverage now\nWell it it looks like it's going to be pretty calm purple\nThat's unusual can I make a suggestion sure\nI Would I Would accept a lower quality insurance policy by that I mean with a beefed up to ... much higher deductible because it's really important now that you only make a claim if you have something that's gigantic\nNumbers gigantic so it depends do you have a mortgage still on your phone no ... we just paint off\nOkay great so you're free to do the deductible you wish and I'm going to tell you to look at something maybe in the range of ten thousand dollars okay\nAnd then you may be able to get the premium back down to where it was and then only if you did have something truly that was terrible would you be making a claim\nRight and so we need to be prepared to just pay out of pocket like the first ten thousand dollars regardless\nExactly and hope that nothing I mean you've had a bad run with yeah I mean these things happen maybe your ... run out I Hope so and you'll have a good long run with nothing happening but the key for for your fellow listener is that with homeowner's insurance\nYou'd want to do the higher deductible gets you a lower premium anyway and up to whatever your mortgage company would allow your case that's not a factor because you want to be in a position that you don't get fired\nFor lame and then have the problem where you're going to go next so it's just a it's a real issue the the insurers only want you for your premiums they don't want you for your claims\nJustin joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Justin\nHello Clark Howard things going for you Justin oh they're doing just fine well good how can I be of

live\nAnd what are you getting your masters him I'm getting my last year as an industrial design oh you're going to have a job prospects aren't you a hopefully so that's great\nBut neither one of us have ever owed a credit card we have no credit I been scared away from that for my entire life and we had when my wife and I want to get our first apartment my dad to co size\nOr that I felt bad right\nYeah [laughter] actually looked into your website and I looked at were war and the best rewards cards\nThat for you right now they're not going to want you\nSure [laughter] and that's why I was going to ask you know what is the best starting car that we could get because of all I mean all we want to do it or credit where I understood it was really have traveling or or say\nOkay so I'm sure as a grad student I don't know if you'll get the same offers an undergraduate would be eligible for playing a college student card\nIs\nYou really want because they don't care about income they figure you know college students are very low level risk\nAnd tend to whatever card they get first they tend to hold for a long time it's not a lifetime and there's a real loyalty factor would be in that first card\nBill T factor would be in that first card have you tried to get a card under any of the college student credit card programs\nI've tried um I Know we have my bank account with ... sorry\nThat's right that's right I don't know of regions offers a college student card but if that's where your customer go into a branch and find out\nThere and we have we got in there and my wife ... have or is that it for like three months now she goes something that we don't want it to do\nEither of you have a credit score\nRight they're not going to issue your car is not going to help to apply for that card and that's why you've got to get in there under one of the college student programs in the first best option okay and if that doesn't work then the best thing to do is\nUh the credit union at your campus\nMhm is to go to the credit union and see if you can do if they don't have a college student card if they can put you in one of the um one of the cards where you put money in savings or the credit union and your limit is based loosely strictly by what some savings\nAnd then you graduate fully out of that typically in six Eighteen months into a regular old card that will

that means to the people that these measures are trying to help the low wage earners that's driving them out of the out of business driving business out of business\nThat's what it ultimately means for Wisconsin these sort of artificial government led minimum wage increases by significant amount\nAnd what we learn from the from the results in the tax reform package breaking news today is the uh

M. J. let's talk to the sea Darren itself market during her WGM drink good afternoon\nHow are you doing good but I think of this woman fired\nWell I don't know what you should have been fired but I think is worse I whenever I'm at a show and it has to do with race especially in the first thing to do what do I think it's\nA race issue that's why she posted it\nIs you know what should we try to get so she posted the black sea urban fire but I'll tell you that these people that say they don't want to be politically correct and they want to do whatever they want\nMe the first time they get punched in the face that the first one on a police on the phone with the police would they want to be or they don't want to be politically correct me myself yeah she should have been crushed in the face of doing it\nMhm well I I think I wouldn't have I wouldn't have punched or in in the face for for doing that don't know that that contributes to the dialogue I guess that that the question becomes your Halloween is one of these times where you kind of\nI don't know you're supposed to let your freak flag fly and you know you you go out and you do kind of fun sort of stuff\nNow I understand that there are there are no limitations on that type of thing in this particular case even if I get it seemed to me here's the issue even if we accept the premise that this was in really bad taste or if it was it was a racist costs to All right let's let let's assume that\nGets then the question to me becomes is it fair or right to make that jump saying All right on her own time she'd gone to a party or had a party or would ever addressed in this costume that means that she should lose her job it's not something she did on on the job\nIt's not like she's Megan Kelly and she's a commentator on the bench ... she's somebody who works at a hospital or as a nurse\nNow she is linked to the hospital because I think on her Facebook page what it says it says where she works so there is a link there I think I think it's pretty tenuous I got to tell you I think the hospital is on thin ice in firing or\nWho have access to private polling data which tends to be a lot more reliable are telling me is what my general sense is Scott Walker is always in tight races my guess is that this will be as tight of a race as he has had\nSimply because Walker has has a ceiling there there's a lot of people in the state that loves Scott Walker there's a lot of people that that hate Scott Walker and it doesn't matter Tony ... is the anti Scott Walker I don't think there's anybody out there who says I Want to run through a wall and vote for Tony ...\nThe only question is are there going to be enough people that are going to be motivated to come out and vote against Scott Walker to give you that fifty percent plus one vote that you end up needing to to win\nSo this is extremely close it is going to depend on turnout\nI Believe I'll make my prediction out I think at the end of the day Walker wins\nBut he only wins if Republican Party voters come home and I look I Will acknowledge this is a year where Republicans are running into ahead with I don't necessarily think I agree that there's going to be this huge balloon wave that it's out there particularly not in Wisconsin\nBut at the same time I understand people on the left hate Donald Trump they are motivated to go out and send Donald Trump message\nVoting against anybody that has an R after their name\nBut what I've seen over the course of the last couple of weeks is I think a lot of Republican voters are coming home they're unhappy with what they saw go on in Washington with regard to the Capitol hearing actually an interesting story about what NBC did and it's an ugly site involving Kavanaugh hearings I share that with you in a little bit\nBut I I think Republican voters are starting to come home it is all about turnout there's no question about it and I know that's a cliche I Know we say that all the time but in the governor's race I think it is really about turnout it's and I will say this\nI think that when it comes to\nModern day Maxine maximizing turnout efforts\nI don't know that there's anybody in the country that does it better than Scott Walker does and the the Scott Walker campaign\nBut I mean the turnout machines gotta be they've gotta get every Republican vote that there is out to vote they've got to get all their supporters out to vote so if you are a Walker supporter\nAnd you appreciate all the good stuff that's happened in the state over the last eight years and you are taking this race for granted you should not I think it's a toss up I think at the end of the day Walker ends up winning but right now the poll numbers forty seven to forty seven\nThe chosen sexually statistically dead heat disco dead heat\nWith um three percent saying they're going to vote for the libertarian candidate Philly Anderson now group who's producing the show for me today\nSeriously why why would you vote for the libertarian candidate and and um I don't I'm not that was a rhetorical question libertarians don't have to call it I mean he he's polling at two or three percent all it is is a potential spoiler candidate\nThat is a wasted vote I mean it just it is a wasted vote why you would do that and you have the right to vote wherever you want and you have the right to not vote but why you would would vote this case for the libertarian candidate in a race where every vote counts\nI mean I get it if you think that okay the the race is going to be fifty five forty five somebody's going to win in the walk so you want to make a statement and send a message so you you vote for the the offbeat candidate but in this particular case\nEvery vote counts and I think it's a decision whether you want to vote for or essentially against Scott Walker so that's the Walker race the poll has it as at a statistical dead heat and I'm an actual an actual dead heat\nAnd I think I think that's a fair accounting for this All right so what's going on in the U.S Senate race and the rates for attorney general we'll talk about that and just a minute twelve forty two Jeff ...\nWayne Larrivee golf

Walker does a little better but it it's it's an extremely close race to the extent that you believe polling All right\nNext race the attorney general's race incumbent bread shovel and um his his challenger Josh call race that hasn't gotten a lot of attention although there's some really nasty ads that are being\nAnd although there's some really nasty ads that are being run particularly some nasty as being run by call I saw one of them this morning I'm again the numbers very very similar to the numbers in the governor's race ... among likely voters forty seven percent\nA call forty five percent that is within the statute of his stature limitations that's within the margin of error it it it's a pick I'm sort of race and my guess is\nThat the attorney general's race probably goes the same way as the governor's race by that I mean I don't I don't see that there's going to necessarily be a lot of ticket splitting that's going on there and my guess is that people come out and they vote for Scott Walker they're going to vote for ... all one of the things that you you see and Republicans need to be concerned about\nAnd I guess Democrats didn't extend to ... is is ballot fatigue ballot fatigue means\nAs people you you start at the top of the ballot with whatever the ... election is and people vote or if it's a presidential year everybody that shows up or almost everybody votes for president\nThen maybe it's the governor's race and then as you start to work your way down people aren't paying attention to the races or they they just don't vote that's what's called ballot fatigue\nAnd um again in the attorney general's race my sense would be that everybody that votes for Walker is going to vote for ... everybody that votes receivers is probably going to vote for call although I could see a little bit a ticket splitting because I'm In ... is the income but\nBut my guess is that race probably is going to be determined in large measure by how the governor's race goes and again within the it's within the margin of error statistically a ... up by two points\nIn October early October it was essentially the same shovel forty seven call forty three now it's triple forty seven call forty five\nThat again is within the margin of error All right the other big race that they are focusing on of course is the race for US Senate\nLeave ... near an incumbent Democrat Senator Tammy Baldwin\nThose numbers have not moved much either in October\nAnd let's see last October or the U.S Senate race early October the market university law school poll had Tammy Baldwin is fifty three percent leave ... we're at forty three percent eight ten point margin the new poll finds\nBaldwin at fifty four percent of one point ... mirror at forty three percent so statistically essentially unchanged and that's that's pretty much to take away you get from all these different polling numbers unchanged with regard to from is this legal purpose most of these elections\nUm

J. lo\nO what do you think we'll get the recognition of what contributes to the gold\nShould be the goal here crying that black people matter [laughter] showing that they don't matter and it should not be\nRight if [noise] now they are that I mean I I guess there's only goes so far is instead of being called negro bar recreational area\nIt was okay it's called ... they they used the N. word to describe okay if that was the official name would I be arguing\nThat okay well it's got a historical context so you can't change or do you know I I I I think you know you have to recognize that the times change I guess I just don't believe and I think most people don't believe at this point in time\nThat that the word negro in and of itself\nIs so offensive that you have to again remove that word from society as well now maybe we'll come to a point where where that is that's where we're going but maybe again that that starts with United negro college fund or the United the national council of negro women\nUm maybe maybe that stretch them changing the name but I I don't think we're there with regard to the use of the the word negro especially especially in this context could you say well there there are certainly context and things that you could use were that were would be offensive and I would agree with you but this doesn't appear to be one of them\nMary and whitewater merrier WGM Jay good afternoon\nYeah and I guess [laughter] um I when I told the trainer a couple of things but after I hated it um I've changed my mind a little bit on it um because I didn't know historical things\nThat the guy I never even heard of them are like me neither [laughter] Wisconsin and you know right me neither\nBut I definitely see the point and I think that yeah it's one person or maybe a handful of people are offended by your your ... [laughter]\nThe word negro not derogatory and I'm sure there are people out there that I think it is because of the historical significance of um of what I understood too you know what why even there no it should be changed it is a contribution to society\nRight you know and I and I think it's great I but unfortunately you know how many probably in a fight so hard on this that it does end up being at least I think of it does get changed after an African American\nRight maybe maybe one of the miners are some yeah maybe one of the miners\nYeah no I mean I guess I look at you you wonder how many battles that you have to fight but I guess what what I find but I find it interesting here is this is\nThis name the use of the word negro appears in a lot of this historical designations naming and you know we we haven't\nYou know we haven't said that this is blatant racism or at least the government hasn't said that and I think it's a very divided community on that and I mean that's fine if the standard is going to be we need to remove that word from society ... okay I guess we can have that conversation but until we do\nI get on with one of the callers who said just because somebody becomes uncomfortable when they see this sign\nI'm without understanding any sort of historical significance or why it's called bad that in and of itself doesn't seem to me to be a justification for changing something that does have historical and cultural impact and goes back but\nA hundred and Seventy years one twenty three generator double duty object\nI'd miss is trying to think of her dressing metal roofing systems with her new permanent metal rough I went on to explain how she's going to love her new metal roof and at the transformation was going to be breathtaking\nWell she put me in my place I mean it was quite explained to me that she didn't hire us because of our home was going to look she invested in a permanent metal rough because she knew that her husband would never again they have to go up and shovel off the rough\nYou see she's been trying to keep gym often refer years with a member of the snow just slide right off every few days or so and he won't be going up there for ongoing maintenance because there is no ongoing maintenance\nThese are just a couple of many reasons why you might consider a permanent rough over a temporary conventional rough\nYou can see pictures of ... just like yours with the designer metal rough at our online showroom beautiful Russ dot com or for a free estimate call Carrie today toll free at eight five five six seven eight rough remember beautiful Ross dot com thank you\nWe stuck it is excited to launch our new training have endorsed cycling stadiums for training sessions available at all wheel and struck at locations starting November fifth through march twenty four get fed have fun become a better writer\nCoached classes that are new stadiums feature state in the arts software and trainers from walking fitness you'll be able to cycle and train on your own bike and I will inspire get training team on fire you and help you become a better writer whether you're a beginner or an advanced rider we have the right class for you and flexible drop in classes allow you to create your own schedule\nDon't miss our training how open house on Wednesday October thirty first from six thirty seven thirty to talk to our to check out our studio and take a spin go to ... rocket dot com to register today four wheeling rockets new winter training had endorsed cycling sessions location closest to you\nAnd we'll see one Wednesday October thirty first from six thirty seven thirty at our training have open house so you can learn more life is short enjoy our training had\n[noise]\n\nJust WGM said holidays are right around the corner to lose him Jay is back with our annual holiday radio show WGM day present the night before Christmas starring sheen Miller the incomparable Jane met near yours truly and they\nSleigh full of Wisconsin celebrities from Turner hall in downtown Milwaukee on Monday November twenty six at six thirty the live radio play will be recorded in front of a studio audience\nAnd you can be a part of it by tickets now or go to W.

to sold out were sold out in the very near future what was NBC thinking no I I understand what they were thinking or remember a couple of weeks ago in in the height of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you've got the last minute\nBy first one woman and then the second woman and then the third woman that Brett Kavanaugh was essentially a gang rapist or had molested them and things like that well that the third woman was this woman named Julie sweat Nick\nAnd she was represented by fleas bag attorney Michael Avon Eddie and she ... she's the one that came forward and essentially implied that Kavanaugh\nHad been involved in in gang rapes at parties it was completely and totally over the top you know but but this is that she was the third woman that came forward\nNBC ran an interview with her they they put her on the air and in this taped interview it turns out that she she backtrack from her allegations that she wasn't as clear it now is turning out that NBC News was aware\nBefore they even put this woman on the air that there were other problems with her story\nIn late September before before they ran the ad with her apparently NBC had contacted the woman who supposedly had submitted a a statement core Robert ratings sweat next story\nWell it turns out that you know NBC they go out they investigate this and investigating if they find out that this woman who supposedly was going to corroborate this story\nHad essentially failed to cooperate anything and she added fact turned on the lawyer the seven Eddie guy she said I don't like that he twisted my words\nNevertheless NBC ran the story and the interview with the sweat Nick alleging you'll gang rapes and stuff\nWithout telling anybody that they had sexually identified the woman who supposedly the one that had to corroborating evidence and then she refused to back up the story at all and walked away with it NBC didn't tell anybody about that until well late last week\nI got a big story in the Washington Post and this shows how bad it is for NBC the Washington Post has really broken bad on NBC\nUm let's see so this is what they they say so once more what was NBC thinking the conservative theory is that the network by withholding important information was trying to help Democrats derail Kavanaugh's nomination yeah I think that's exactly what was going on it also says there's a lesson malevolent explanation\nWhich is simply the news organizations are leery\nOf ever questioning the credibility of sexual assault accusations and so they're like okay this woman is saying that she was the cabin always party to a gang rape even though we've got all this evidence to suggest that she's perhaps\nMaking this up or not being candid or there's evidence that tends to disprove what she's saying\nWe're ... we don't want to run the story because we don't want to get the you know ... me too movement ... mad at us\nIn the event that anything lord forbid were to happen\nYou would have you're not talking about teachers with guns you're not talking about principles with guns you're talking about a trained sworn law enforcement official on the scene who might be might be able to intervene and at least\nGet early early access to see it might be able to make a difference maybe not\nFor some bad were to happen you have that in addition if you have security problems at the high school if you have a fight breaks out or whatever again you've got a law enforcement officer on the scene who might be able to break up the fight or stop the altercation or do something before it gets worse\nIn addition you've got that police officer on the scene\nLike again to interact with with the kids to interact with the students\nSo maybe maybe you know a student who's only contact with the police's gee I remember when we were pulled over and my older brother was smoking a joint and they treated them I think they treated him wrong or whatever you you get the chance to see the police officer in a different sort of contacts and maybe maybe just maybe\nCome away with a a different understanding of what being a police officer is all about\nBut in any event you've got this group of people out Madison is willing to shut down the school board meetings because they feel so strongly that there shouldn't be cops in schools for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the academic mortgage talk and X Y\nI don't know about you but I think the answer is it less cops in school actually I think the answer is more cops in school but the idea of taking a police officer out up that's been there forever taking them out of the Madison High schools I think it's absurd\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty two police officers belong in schools as educational resource officers or whatever you want to call them my answer would not just be yes it would be heck yes Portland for seven nine nine one six twenty what do you think we discuss next one

M. J. R. I. A. protest group feels so strongly about this issue that they shut down the school board meeting in Madison one month [noise]\nWhat is that issue\nWell Madison for years and years has had a a police officer\nThat they call them ... educational resource officers but they're they're cops to warn law enforcement officers in each one of the high schools this group says they got to go and the school board was getting ready to authorize the new budget which would have kept the money in the budget to allow these cops to stay there this group shut it down\nAnd they are irate that Madison would continue to allow police officers in its public high schools\nStacey in Milwaukee Stacey on WGM Jay\nHi Stacey what do you think\nThat if they did have a I call 'em an hour or so that was our phone I'm On the road I don't know him well\nUh\nYeah I mean I guess that's it if if if again lord forbid\nThere was ever somebody that got into one of these schools and you had an an act of violence or whatever [noise] wouldn't you feel better knowing that it at least you had one of the first responders that was was on the seat now now maybe that officer would able to stop it maybe he'd be a victim who knows but at least\nAt least you have somebody a trained law enforcement officer in there who would be able to intervene who wouldn't want that\nRight I agree\nI think the ... now I see this is one I understand there's so many different things that are out there and and I understand reasonable people can disagree about issues and I try to do my show with that in mind\nThis is not one that I see that particular way here's a text with all the shooting going around the country you would think the parents would welcome having a police officer in the school Evans says\nRational and clear thinking is a very short supply in Madison why do you think we call it the People's Republic of Madisonville makes the point so who are they going to call when their sons and daughters need first responders yeah now you you might say to me Well Jeff I Know I don't get this\nWhy why don't they want why doesn't this group wants to police officers in in the school but going back to the public comment on this say again this is members of this particular group\nThey believe that having a police officer inside the school and I'm quoting from the Madison papers now can negatively affect students of color\nAnd feed into the school to prison pipeline\nWell okay what what feeds into the school to prison pipeline is kids that leave school go out\nCommit crimes that didn't require them to be sent to jail or to prison how a police officer in the school contributes to that is frankly beyond me here's one that was one of the activists says uh this is Bianca Goldman a member of freedom in\nQuote ain't no amount of training ain't no amount of special trick typically it's is going to matter when it comes to black and brown kids because police officers see us as thugs and criminals All right it seems to me\nThat's the problem is not the police officers in the school it seems to me instead that the problem is people like this woman who\nI again views the police officers at as the enemy to police officers see us as thugs and criminals\nActually I think this quite candidly I think this Bianca Goldman as we do well to interact with probably some of the police officers that work as again the educational resource officers\nBecause maybe my guess is you spent five or ten minutes with any of these people who are assigned into the school is police officers and what you'll find is they don't view the students as the war criminals at all I think it would be you know a positive thing in that regard but\nBut the this is a problem this is the mindset that that some people have\nAnd then because they've got their own little warped version of reality that's out there they decide to carry that over and they get no look I Do you have police officers that are bad cops absolutely absolutely and and you know for that person if you have somebody that in that position and in his behaving in treating\nI don't know the high school kids with disrespect or whatever\nAnd in his behaving and treating I don't know the high school kids with disrespect or whatever they need to be out there there's no question about it but this idea that oh well this is the way all police officers are going to treat us and and it's going to contribute to the school to jail pipeline no I mean it humanized as police officers so maybe\nMaybe if a police officer on the street has an interaction with the kid\nThe kid decides All right I'm going to do with the officer says I'm not going to run away or whatever I'm I'm just saying I don't see this is a I don't see how anybody loses

would happen is if there was if there was a fear of liability\nWhat would happen is the the Web sites themselves would have to do a better job of policing themselves if you had\nSome nut case who let let's let's take the example of the tragedy that happened over the weekend\nIf you had some nut case that was on your website\nAnd was talking about how they hated the Jewish people and they thought all Jewish people should should die et cetera et cetera and going on these rants\nIf you had a website that would be liable if something in fact happened and that person act it out but I guarantee you that website would be doing something about it they would either say okay we're not going to allow you to post anymore or they would singled out notify law enforcement hey by the way\nYou you should know what's going on here we have this person in wherever who's posting these different things\nIt if they had some legal responsibility\nThen I think they would have to behave in a more responsible fashion and and look I I understand that you've got First Amendment issues believe me I mean you're talking to somebody is always say who makes his living under the umbrella of the first amendment and I I understand it that the problem is\nYou know you you can't stop people from you know talking and saying crazy things that that's not necessarily a crime\nBut at the same time it could be the basis for some civil liability or something like that don't we want the Web sites to have to at least I don't know be somewhat of a gatekeeper for what goes on there just like\nNewspapers are are TV stations are or radio stations are don't shouldn't there be certain standards okay a jets and randomly gesture at WM J\nI um I disagree I Would have to say that your Web sites are absolutely not live\nUm it's taking away from personal responsibility for action which is kind of the way this country's going I think it's a big part of the problem but trying to hold the website accountable for what people say and then after that it's like trying to hold the high scores or Chris will sure\n[noise] no I guess I don't I I guess I I disagree with that I mean if if if if you arrive were running a website and there is a guy that's on there and it is posting\nStuff that it clearly you know we you understand it's a threat or you understand it says hate speech and it it's not too tough to figure out that this person is ready to act out\nIs there anything wrong with say give the website has some responsibility to notify somebody or just shut the guy down I mean can do we really want to condone the website just totally turning a blind eye to it\n[noise] well the website It's MORNING titled Fisher somebody down that's their right to ... however going after them for liability it's just impractical or what about all the people that failed that stuff and then never do anything or do you draw the line\nWell that that that's what the I mean I think that that's the course with with the issue is because there's a lot of these cases that are out there that just talk about it I guess my my problem with the way it is now it just completely and totally the wild west because there is immunity\nTo the Web sites especially some of the fringe websites that there's they have no incentive at all to try to rein in some of the crazies war to notify authorities that there might be these crazies out there that you at least\nMaybe you want to look at and looking I 'cause here here's the probably ever seen the movie would you ever see the ... movie Minority Report\nAnd it's a it's with Tom Cruise and it said in the future and and what they do is they have this technology the movies about they have this technology that allows them to identify\nCriminals before the crimes are committed and so they go out and they stopped the crime before it's committed but the problem is\nSometimes they get it wrong and it's kind of an interesting movie in that regard you don't want to see this country become like Minority Report but at the same time I I don't think you want to just allow it to be a complete and total free for all I don't think the first amendment is absolute to twenty

veteran safety right now but I I don't know if they're not that much worse either you know what I mean yeah exactly I I don't think they're marginally better that they think they just might be a little bit worse but whatever\nBut the the bigger thing in play here so they're trying to peel back layers of the young and then just sort of see what Brian ... is done in a short time as GM\nAnd this goes back to draft day when the Packers treated down there quite another first round draft pick and that might be picked up or thirty one who knows the saints are playing pretty good football right now but nonetheless the Packers will go in to next April or may raft with two first round draft picks\nWhen they acquire a fourth runner here now for the Clinton big trade I Know it's only a service rout are but they're acquiring draft capital\nNow to me the trades orchestrated by Ghouta Coons including the one that happened on ...\nTo me that's recognizing the roster is lacking court talent in depth and I'm Talking about core talent in depth in their prime and this reflects on the ... years of twenty Thirteen to twenty Fifteen just three players reached the second contract with the Packers I mean these guys should be the backbone of your roster\nAnd they're not even on the roster the majority of them and I think to to cook just recognize that and he's trying to keep a teen competitive but also stockpiling here a little bit it tried to build for the future because it is a talent depleted roster its aging veterans make them a lot of money and a lot of first and second year players so this is why\nYou made the change of general manager though isn't it um it is you needed a new direction you needed a new approach\nAnd I think already good against is done things in just in his not even full first year that Ted Tom's would not have done or didn't do or had the opportunity to do but didn't um so yeah and that's you know these things take time I I I don't think the Packers are\nNow in rebuilding mode because you wouldn't sign Aaron Rodgers to the kind of contract did you did and then and then rebuild\nAnd I wanted to go to ... to comment too I mean you don't really tank or you're not really sellers like you do like you see in major league baseball or in the NBA doesn't really work like that in the NFL doesn't know what the reason why the Packers are three three and one I Know it's a tough stretch here in November I mean if I got blown away\nOn Sunday night so it's not like anybody is running away with the NFC North\nAnd it's not like all hope is lost it's not like oh this team has no chance of making the postseason it's going to be difficult\nBut uh no this isn't a a a sign of you know they're they're wasting up the white flag here for the twenty Eighteen season I think you were just looking at Montgomery as you pointed out I mean he was going one way or the other so much at least get something back on how Clinton decks\nYou you take away some safety Depp you talk about you talked about veteran president you take away a guy who plays a ton of snaps but you're also talking about a position that\nHas had its troubled point last couple of weeks it actually has been better it hasn't been as big a liability but again you have a lot of death and you've got veterans presence at that quarterback position some of those guys are going to have to shift over and you know get some staff to safety\nObviously now start to Mike in Chicago and double duty I'm Jay him I\nGo I don't think the worst without\n... 'cause I thought he kinda we watched that first year and\nWe're going back to last year I thought he was really really too far off the line from scrimmage was like in a different area code to reflect on the game Sunday it was off the map much for me anyway guy and it was just supporting heartbreaking off\nGame and it begins to choice you know like the overtime games against the wall and the devastating off against what you're doing and that's why I don't think\nWe're going to get over the super bowl a period of time right now it's fair to say what a great point like Roger ...\nLet's see what a great point like Roger ...\nSame thing for me every week guys are just good for pointing unless you're aware off too often for a week and schooling point you know basically at one time they can point with the way through the third quarter to four line I'm\nSean ... conversion venture capital as far as I'm sure a great show it was fake you\nAppreciate the phone call Michael would restaurant on the other side will hear more from the Packers GM to address the media today will do it All right up to this middle whites ... playbook continues on WGM Jay\nWhere the ... family and do it yourself bathroom center near state fair sixty ticketing green power beautiful shower doors are now covered with a rated X. type coating the soap and water from showering just sheets right off it leans glass nice things clean for you remember a slogan\nI did it myself to do it yourself\nFleet resolution was ongoing therapy and there are genetic information can be treated safely ban officially with almost no side effects is possible to relieve your [noise]\nYou owe it to yourself to find out if Harry neural therapy can do for you when it's done for countless others why waste schedule your appointment today for one for four or five three Seventy eighty\n\nWake up with our eyes literally happened moments before I was driving through the market interchange or it was\nGood morning ... you have that rain storm last night it was kind of down\nSo good news bad news candidates for the brewers gene news radio WGM Jay\n\nHe's really where every Sunday\nTo go to what happened on the ... do you believe it was to have gotten this done it's nice if they did and I think he feels better about it as well where he said the hikers Wayne Larrivee on Wisconsin's afternoon news with genre your days at three twenty\n... we're all home all the Green Bay Packers in Nineteen twenty nine WGM jak [noise] [noise]\nThey'll just days have been Wisconsin head to the polls what take away is are there for the latest Marquette law school poll\nDean Miller dies and tomorrow we'll look at the numbers of seven Twenty one that's tomorrow in Wisconsin's morning news ... with the what's the other whites Packers play book are the Packers of nine or ten when team this season if so where do those winds come from will take a look back coming up after the six thirty news ... Packers GM\nBrian good a good way to address the media earlier today and he was asked if the trades of time of gum or you know Clinton decks\nSpecifically Montgomery was made because of recent comments from the locker room\nSort of everything under consideration when you write this kind of decisions on a performance comes first that's always kind of the major factor and it's just citizens but everything is taken into account and um but it's never usually just want their\nStance for the deaf to the secondary ... believes the ... will be just fine\nYeah obviously a very good player um but we have a lot about is that I'm finishing the get out there a lot of guys that have another opportunity I think they're really excited to see what they can\nDo it perhaps not so timely Jeff one of the only two players not the practice today safety germane Whitehead ... great when the rains it pours ride I suppose it does [noise] um\nI I Am not shocked by the ... I'm really not shocked by the moves and\nI think the Packers are a a fringe playoff team uh they make up the creamy middle of the NFL's middle class and that's what it is we talked about this last week there are ... and there have nots and then there was a bulky middle class and the Packers are right in the middle of it\nBreak with the entire random see north isn't it yeah and that's why you can't look at this and say let's wash for me that the team is going down the tubes whatever they just don't hear what other still right in it\nBut I don't think they are among the elites and you've got to see even if they win their division right I Know what the white you know they get home playoff game great but I think it's Philadelphia battle the thing that ... the ... of course the quarterback\nWas on ... [laughter]\nNo I you know we talked about this last week when you look at the other end of the noise teams they still have to play each other you know there there's five games each that the Vikings bears in line to have to believe it's all going to kick off this weekend in Minnesota in Detroit\nOr on the schedule so you know it starts there and and there's going to be a lot of I I think beating up on each other and you know talk about I don't think it will be as bad as twenty Thirteen but nine six and one\nI think might might be going up there wasn't as you mean we'll see I still think the Vikings will end up I'm winning this division and and I I Do believe their roster is better than than a nine when team\nBut um this is what I don't like about the NFL certainly this deep into the season we talk about it being a week to week league when you can't figure out who's good and who isn't rams are good okay giants are bad\nSeahawks bat or a cardinals or bad\nUm but everybody else I had no idea\nIt might not you know you're right fitzpatrick right well he's ... now you know he comes back against Cincinnati I you know these huge come back in the fourth quarter they didn't finish it off but\nI don't know what to believe from that team well isn't that amazing if the beauty of the NFL right there in a nutshell I don't know just you know I'm I'm all for parity but I Am not for confusion and it is a land of confusion right now have you on the NFL Phil Collins wants to know I don't know good defenses in the NFL tell you that much um\nBut I think the Packers are are playing better\nAnd no doubt that that puts a lot of importance on this New England game and I'm not going to say that this is a must win game but if you lose this game yeah that was a very big premium on beating Seattle on the road\nA possibly being Minnesota there were members you don't need Minnesota the road they do have the tie breaker then I had to have one on one one and I I still think that road game against Chicago was going to be difficult I Would not discount either Miami or Atlanta home games I'm In the obviously gonna be a little bit colder than what you're used to by\nDetroit has
