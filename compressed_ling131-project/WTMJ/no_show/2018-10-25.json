throughout the week here in the whole available they are\nFor some of these contests in Los Angeles for more of the team we welcome in Rome hackers don't come if Mike offered him Mike\nHow's it going very I'm doing well nobody week for you right always at work\n[laughter] I got a little bit of time off over the weekend or actually got a chance to to take in the badger game at a camp Randall watched a Wisconsin take care of business against Illinois so it was nice to ah to catch them fresh air and a little snow\n[laughter] Saturday nothing wrong with the who I guess he there will not be snow in Los Angeles and the Packers take on the rams I wanted to get your thought on this it has become a bit of a storyline here the Packers are eight and a half point underdog this is kind of new territory for an Aaron Rodgers led team how is this being viewed in the locker room\nWell it's interesting 'cause uh the voluntary Adam set on Tuesday he he actually brought up the thing about the the point spread in Vegas and this being the biggest underdog the actors have been\nWith Rogers as a starting quarterback and you said hey you know not that we need things to us but those kinds of things do stick in the back of players minds and they go okay you know yeah there you know professional athletes you know how it is great if there's any chance to put a chip on their shoulder\nThey're going to take advantage of that and this is one of those situations the Packers very quietly are looking at it as okay nobody expects us to do anything everybody thinks the rams are just going to\nContinue to roll and they'll get to know and all that and and the Packers were like well you know there there's still a football game of the plate and and now we're going to go out there you know probably as healthy as the Packers have been quite frankly should speak one coming off of the pie and they're going to take their best shot\nYou know I think back when the Packers played at New England with Matt when winning quarterback and the Packers were underdogs in that situation I think that was the game or Mike mccarthy somewhat famous line where nobody's underdog so inbred at his mentality but I also remember a net gain McCarthy trying to steal a possession with an onsite daycare\nI mean is that is that kind of where we're at here is that how you slow the rams down trying to get more possessions than they have\nYou know that's that's an interesting question I I wouldn't be surprised if the Packers maybe try to steal a possession no more along the line here but the other way I look at it great certainly that New England game in two thousand ten it's going to think back on but uh but also think about two thousand and twelve I don't know if you remember this but it was weeks six\nThe Houston Texans were five and all they have the number one defense in the lead Jay Jay ... and all those guys are shutting everybody down the Packers were two or three they'd gotten whipped it home and weak one by San Francisco they suffered through the fail Mary and the second half melt down in Indianapolis but to go off\nTo an Andrew Luck team and it was prime time in Houston this was going to be the big showcase for the upcoming Houston, Texas an air Rogers went in after six touchdown passes and absolute random off in their own building\nNow I'm not saying that that's going to happen I think this rams teamed up twenty Eighteen is far superior to the Houston Texans of twenty twelve but that is an example of just you never know and especially you never know when you have\nA quarterback the caliber of an Aaron Rodgers that uh if if he gets rolling I mean who knows this could end up being a shootout between Aaron Rodgers and Jared go off you know and and we all know what turnovers can do if a if a high powered dolphins like the rams turn the ball over a couple of times that would be a\nA possession or to the Packers could steal so to speak and and then you never know so yeah the Packers are under dogs in this game in Vegas and understandably so but to Aaron Rodgers has proven in situations like this before that that sometimes this can bring out a pretty good game in him\nMike sponsored Packers dot com joining us on sports central presented by Miller light the guys are pretty healthy I had to buy we will do that for you who's the most critical piece returning do you believe this weekend\nI think it's the I think it's the veteran receivers if they do indeed comeback now the far you know the in the practice we we don't really know for sure how things are going to shake out come Sunday afternoon but if the Packers yet Randall Cobb Andrew Animal House back\nI I think it could really do wonders for the off and now the rookies felt is gambling you St brown those guys that made a lot of progress they really stepped in and played pretty well given the situation all things considered the first half of the seasons to get\nThrown into a to some softball games like that but this often was built you know all through training camp all through the off season on having Adams Cobb Allison and Jim Graham as the top for targets\nFor Aaron Rodgers and uh and obviously you know Aaron Jones and and the backfield trio to ah to hopefully hopefully provide some run past balance and for a lot of reasons the type of games they have been in the injuries to certain guys you know all these other things the Packers haven't really\nPlayed the kind of a sense that they wanted to play from the start of the season and uh and you know this'll be certainly a good time to start the stretch coming up you know the rams the patriots on the road home with Miami than back on the road\nTo Seattle and Minnesota I I Can't recall any time that the Packers of have had a five week stretch where they play three division winners from the previous year on the road or it doesn't really get\nMuch tougher than that and uh so for hackers are going to hit their stride on often now time\nYou know make up I've watched a decent amount of ram football I think they're an exciting team to watch and if you like our parents they've got it and if you like defense they've got that to what I've noticed about the games they play\nI mean they step on the accelerator immediately and it seems like they more than any team in the NFL can force you out of a game plan you know and I know like the currently talked about wanting to run more we need more attempts on the ground\nBut as I've watched the rams play they make you pass they make you have to have because when you blink your right all of a sudden they've got Seventeen points on the board\n[laughter] yeah I think I think what you said there really is the key point grade they take you out of your game plan and and unfortunately for the Packers that's happened to them multiple times this year because they've been down by three scores even for scores that half time\nIn some of these games and there there have been these games where the Packers heaven you know really been able to execute their game plan for a whole game\nAnd yeah the rams are keen that forces you ought to much like the twenty love impact pursue or get up by a couple of touchdowns instill a minnow huddle and as you say your foot on the gas and\nAnd uh it does it put so much pressure on the other team that are that they end up you know throwing away have to call sheet at half time and you just trying to figure out a way to get back in\nThe Packers are trying to avoid that in this game obviously they want to have some past balance they want to be able to to keep her possessions\nAs a little bit minimized a in terms of how much that needs to be on the field all those kinds of things but you know it's it's all it's all easier said than done and certainly with the rams clean at home\nIf they get a if if they get rolling than the Packers are going to find themselves in a situation that thin already too much this year which is down by multiple scores in\nThe second half and Aaron Rodgers has to turn back yard football\nOr twenty five Perry's combined with the running back he was that would tell me that it's a pretty close games on multiple to see that balance here on Sunday afternoons Mike appreciate your time thanks so much for joining us a bi weekly Silverman bad to worse to grind to a gym used\nAfterward the growing continue yeah no

certainly a credit to my kudos\nFor free at all but they have a double digit\nLeads in two or three games they play it including the other night again the next night he point lead at half time\nAll the ... what by one of the horse a common theme their job that I had to sit for it to the park for for for the waves and those are the wave to the question why were those leave ...\nWell I think if you go back to the season opener look I I think the Charlotte Hornets or a very good team and they will be a playoff game this year but when you look at that game it was Kemba Walker who finished with forty one points and really just would not go away and this is the second half\nAgainst the Knicks on Monday you can point to that third quarter where the three point shots weren't falling and what was most interesting was they went what one of Thirteen I think in the quarter and honesty and Chris Middleton both talked about that after the game and in the honest pointed to\nIt's simple math right three point is more than two we knew this is our strategy get open looks take good three's if you have an open shot take it just goes threes dunks layoffs were going to keep doing that even if the shots are falling we believe they'll start to fall so that was really interesting that despite the struggles\nThey didn't break away from it now those struggles help the Knicks get back in the game but as he pointed to\nYou're not going to keep missing so we saw them heat up again in the fourth quarter and I think that just shows you how much this team buys into what my voting holders preaching and has them doing that scene things not working seeing the results not there they still stuck with it and it paid off in the fourth quarter [noise] those\nSeventy Sixers come in after a heartbreaking loss of a boy at night one thirty three one thirty two\nThey also come in and uh there there was a report that better than it would be on the floor tonight I've not seen about their brigades just yet but I should have boy even if he's on the floor for Fifteen minutes the Sixers are one of those ... teams that have that significant the light that could raise the bar I think that makes it pretty ...\n[noise] well it's it's an interesting team to win that their biggest change is putting Marcel false and the starting lineup and I mean if you buy into the advance stats analytics and you look into the pacing and in space here\nIt's not a good fit because you have been image and mark helpful just two guys that are consistently knocking down jump shot so\nThat I think it's kind of slow down the Seventy Sixers off and Joel and be you know you're going to have to deal with and this is a guy that you know for all he does in the in the new age of big guys playing\nHe's still a traditional back to the basket guy that can be a force in the post and the outside defensively this team to is it feels like it's taken a step back I Know it's just for games but coach Brett Brown talked about it a little bit and it's free games too I think one of the things if you people pointed to last year and the off season was\nYeah the Sixers still have that young talent and they still have the link\nBut how do you replace guys like her son Eli Silver Lake Marco bell in LA and Brett Brown even said that's been one of their biggest issues for games in the season is replacing\nHer son every soldier because not only is he not there\nBut the guys that they counted on replacing them in Wilson Chandler and make them a scholar\nThey've been either on a minute's restriction or hurt as well so defensively they can give you a lot of fits with that link and you still have to find a way to try and slow down ... he and Joel envied basically doubled doubles every time they've been on the court for the last three to four months of MBA time\nBut in terms of shooting that could be one of the issues for the team I Know Jaycee radically has been off to a good start back to back thirty point games but this Philadelphia team feels a little more vulnerable than there were a season to go [noise]\nYeah that's interesting to watch but I got off of that too and if you are right now the only undefeated teams of east are Iran with Hawaii letter billboards of our heroes that got the buck the courses that\nAre like ... and older that Detroit without ... right there a team that I certainly have their ... year after the parade for Blake Griffin at what the little people that are they got back to respectability but there are you a great third here at least as well\n[noise] yeah and you know that's I think one of the more interesting teams there's a lot of those teams in eastern conference where\nYou wonder what happens with the Charlotte Hornets that we'd just touched on that feels like they have enough talent to be a playoff team lost a lot of close games last year they set the NBA record for most losses games decided by for less point\nThe pistons to where you touched on Blake Griffin into starting at fifty points last night\nContrary drummers well I think the big thing for the ... the addition of the way in case the but the eastern conference this really feels like it's you know the top four teams were the Indiana Pacers fit in in in what the gap is maybe it's really the top five with them\nYou know that I throw the hornets in there as well but\nThose last two spots you could really see anything in the Knicks or another team that we saw a Monday Night where new coach\nDavid fizz Dale is brought a lot of the stuff that we've seen with my boat and holds er and despite the poor record the Knicks are playing teams top so this is going to be a very interesting eastern conference and you've touched on the Toronto Raptors\nA week from ... well not a week from Monday Night the raptors come here if the bucks get past the Sixers tonight with what they have on the rise and there's a good chance\nMonday's game next week your advice or form could be

Wisconsin congressman growth and do you agree as as a lot of people are saying that the health care is the number one issue in the states are discussing\nUm health care and uh making sure you have enough people for industry I think the two things I hear about most our health care and you know my district has more manufacturing jobs now their district in the country I don't care whether you're young and manufacturing are doing in the medical field we have a shortage of people to work\nAnd if we're going to have this economy boom we have to have more people change their jobs are available out\nThere is always great to talk to Wisconsin congressman going broke we got to get you back in Studio soon\nAbsolutely next time on Capitol dry All right good to see us thanks for coming in Congress and\nHave always wanted to talk to a as I said there's a lot going on and we'll keep you up to date on the way to stories as the amuses next right here in ... in\nThe morning was the night away with you on this Wednesday don't forget our show bull is oftentimes sweaters signed me up WGN Jaycee the question Netflix is out with his second season of\nMaking a murder\nSteven every guilty or innocent simple as that you can weigh in on the Twitter poll will do that every day on the show going forward so there's your opportunity\nAlso on us he's twenty W ... as well as a joining us now is outstanding attorney general hosted in Wisconsin brush him a good morning\nThe Martin the higher you good so you had a big meeting I think it was last night's or this week on the opioid and mess problem in the state what are we what are we learning about that problem is as all of us in the state of Wisconsin\nIt seems like we all know someone or nor salmon it's been affected by this what are we learning about how are we dealing with it\nYeah that is a factory I it it was touched everybody if you if it's not your family if somebody you know well and that that's true for almost every Wisconsin I [noise] well\nWhat we have learned is that we have to work at it from a collaborative comprehensive approach to this forever we have gone after drug problems by going after only ... the supply side\nOf it never worked and we shouldn't have been surprised because as long as the demand exists somebody is going to spend the money proceed with somebody is going to be willing to sell drugs to people who are willing to spend money to buy drugs you have to address the supply side and we are doing that very effectively and\nAnd we call hosted that event yesterday with the two U.S attorneys in the eastern western district of Wisconsin I'm and local law enforcement with walking police department and among others\nWhen we've never work better as federal state and local partners but we also have to go beyond just than just going after the drug dealers we've got to address wire people using drugs and so this conference yesterday had over five hundred people and many of those many of them were\nHealthcare specialists treatment a experts a victim advocates law enforcement prosecutors social services public health we had everyone together and we know that\nWe know that we've got to get more treatment in place for people suffering we've built it since two thousand four team and I took office\nAh we had twenty nine counties with treatment alternative and diversion court programs in Wisconsin we now have fifty one\nAnd two tribal communities and we're going to work to keep growing that for some of the smaller county it's hard for them to have the economy of scale to operate a court tired of the staff you need to do it but we're gonna we're we're going to keep working on ways to have regional court so that we can get that available to every county\nWe've got to figure out why do people start using in the first place we know often times it is traumatic experience as people have their children ... teachers telling me that by kindergarten and first grade they know which kids are going to be using drugs by the time they're in junior high\nWe've never taken advantage of that knowledge before we are now going to take advantage of that that's why with our school safety grants were requiring schools and requiring makes it sound like they're resisting because they're welcoming test\nBut schools are now going to be training every single full time staff member in adverse childhood experiences of trauma informed care and then ten percent of the school staff are going to get adolescent mental health advanced adolescent mental health training and we're going to safety intervention teams all of this is designed to\nWhen we identify those kids that are struggling to do something about it to get services plugged into that child into their family\nTo make sure that they don't become the kid at in junior high that's using drugs are engaging in violence an acting out will be able to prevent more kids from using drugs to be with rent more kids from engaging in violence in our school all of that he's going to make her seat safer and stronger long term\nWe're talking to Wisconsin insurance ... W TMZ let me ask you about the story I read the other day about the DNA backlog I Wonder when did you get your take on why that is and what we're doing in the state of Wisconsin to address that\nYeah there's a whole lot of factors that are playing a role in this one of them is a year and a half ago the FBI increase the um there there are different locations on a person's DNA strand\nAnd they are trying to think of the right word here\nThe past we used before could only we we can only cast\nCertainty to a certain number of locations will now were you able to look at more locations that gives us more certainty ... when we get again a as a result\nBut that increased the number of locations that are scientists look at by forty percent which doubles their work\nSo I'm doing that we made it harder for them to produce the results we get better science we get more reliability and that's a good thing but that they've increased the work we also saw we've also seen\nLaw enforcement better train thanks for the work we've done it the OJ to collect more evidence so at crime scenes that bringing in more cases of evidence to help prove people guilty we've also expanded the use of our of our crime lab crime scene response teams we have one in all three labs\nThat go to a crime scenes to help elect that really minute that really difficult to find evidence\nAs a result we've got more evidence to test in my first two years in office we saw submissions to the crime lab for evidence testing caught\nBy eighty percent and that's you can't expect your staff\nWas that was stretched all ready to handle that\nAre you going after additional staffing and and and and budget dollars to deal with this yep\nYes we are now we didn't jump right to that because we first I transferred some other conditions from other parts of the OJ to the crime labs we also created forensic biology\nThat are helping keep the analysts that their desks or the analysts do their work and some other scientists can do work that you don't need the analysts to do the analyst is the most expensive most valuable person that our lab they take a year and a half to train to do DNA work and\nThere there's a lot of competition for them out there and the private sector so they get poached from us\nSo we need to keep them at their lab do at the bench doing their work we also created some uh some forensic scientist that go to the crime scenes that we can keep again keep the animal is doing their work those things started to make a difference but we've seen that the submissions have continued to grow\nSo we hired an outside an outside source the national forensic scientist but you came in and conducted analysis\nIt came on and conduct allows us of our lab concluded what we're doing was or the right direction but we were going to need to tire more of those same people\nSo that's what we've proposed in our budget submission that political fourteen more of a forensic scientists in our labs that are going to do that work and the national Science Institute believes that that will that will resolve issues\nLast thing for yeah we're talking Wisconsin attorney general Brad Sherman WTO O. J. the breaking news story the last couple of days and said these explosive devices found that the homes\nOr George Soros yesterday today apparently the offices of rock Obama former presidents and a ... bill and Hillary Clinton as we've seen the attention and the instability rise in this country is this a byproduct of that do you think\n[noise] boy that that takes it to another level that it isn't the every day people kind of\nAngrily shouting at each other at dangerous I I'm Amazed that someone was able to get those devices in the places where I Would think there is pretty heavy security\nOn Mr sorrow says well protected should be or down this ... this is frightening and we do need to tone down his rhetoric when you've got to start with got start recognizing that we found a lot of problems\nWorking together you know when you talk about the opioid epidemic those things are supported by a bipartisan way in our state legislature the hope legislation office of school safety both bipartisan legislation in the need to focus more on recognizing that\nWhen it comes to a really important things an awful lot of the time we do work together well and stop yelling at each other\nLike ... let let people run on the merits lets people let\nPeople talk about ideas to uh to get reelected instead of this this rhetoric that we hear this but the ana ... political out this is all contributing to it\nHave you ever built a memorial before I have not this was the first foray so where where do you start with that process well\nI was actually a a given an artist concept that was developed by another ... high school graduate or David heirs\nAnd Gordon and a year ago so who you've spoken with earlier this month or just asked if I were to help take this idea and develop it into a concept that we could use for fundraising and give folks have visual on what this might look like some day\nIs a pretty remarkable and striking rendering which you can see on the Web site at ... dot com ... when you think of regime to be happy to point toward New York and all of that I assume physics has to come into play a little bit okay how do we get that in the year and make that work\nAbsolutely and that was one of the first the challenges that I face was holy cow this is a you know one ton piece of steel just over one ton and how do we support this I reached out to some of my professional contacts I'm an engineer\nAnd he gave me some advice as to what we might need to do in that it was actually possible because you get an artist concept it doesn't always translate into reality\nI'm so that was a that was one of the first steps in uh making sure this could happen\nAnd Peter what's your uh how'd you get involved at ... asked me [laughter] why rented previously\nWe've worked together um I worked for flights them landscaping around the owner and principal a landscape designer and so he needed that and so I volunteered to help\n'em and so then I came up with the the whole design of a site why was it important to be involved in the project well I've been out to nine eleven site and it was very moving for me and I\nCouldn't raise my hand fast enough\nWhen you see a different sites that had some ... ... either influences are there and pressures how does that work when you say okay I Want to replicate or at least you bring something to light here he ... that isn't the same in New York or Washington but also as a meaning in depth to it\nWhen I tried to do was using a monitor that you don't never forget so instead of just creating memorial we wanted to create kind of a teaching center so you know her Fifteen sixteen year olds were going to live when this happened\nAnd it's so close to us or me who are older but there are people that it's not\nSo in their face or in their\nUm so you're not just in his consciousness as much as I said we went through it or were there when I heard about ... everybody knows where they were when it happened\nI'm teaching him how did you incorporate that into your design so and so what we did was I Would I Do is build a are designed a ring of of trees to end in sight that ring there's an amphitheater um words race where people can sit and listen to someone talk about the event\nI'm In the middle of the um circle is this Pentagon shaped desk\nI'm In honor of the victims you know of that event and on top of that is where the beams going to stand so it's going to be very dramatic as people look at whoever's speaking they'll have there been pointing at New York and will be very dramatic\nDusting when you first started to take part in this project have you noticed anything since then what what is raised your eyebrows what have you felt how is this gone as you've gone through this process\nUm for me it was it was just the awareness I mean I've been working on this for four and a half years now\nAnd just getting out there talking to people and uh you know young ... as you said before the younger generation that did not experienced is emotionally\nI'm there all the come up and talk to us and touched the beam and you know some of us tell them that they're going to be enlisting and you know in the military um because they want because this war is continuing to go on today and they wanna they wanna help\nAnd um they don't personally my my stories that my daughter is nine years old she was actually born on nine eleven\nAnd she came home a from first grade with a book about the terrorist attacks and that just a you know sent chills on my spine that you know because of my involvement because this is in the schools\nUm in the community people are learning about it and they're asking questions about it and they're not easy questions to answer but at least people are talking about it and that's what's important to me\nAnd one thing we should point out to ... as we raised is being one of the ... one of the aspects that I find so important and said you'll still be able to touch it correctly can actually put your hand on the bean even if in the area for some people like tactical experience actually could help in some way as you try to comprehend what happens\nIs there's some challenges for either want to use some chance we have something that that\nBig and that heavy to to build it in a way that's one incredibly impressive to people like my body but also save for all people that do come upon this thing\nI think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this and the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolates from\n... where do you have this ring of trees that surrounds the space and making it more intimate um\n... you can surrounded by the states you're almost cuddled are held by it\nAnd the significance of the tree that we used that surround it is the pear tree I'm On the site there was one survivor tree after the accident which was this ornamental pair for kind of taken as a symbolism of the rings around this whole states\nAnd then um\nAnd that again creates this kind of intimate space where you're not just out in this field and uh and we wanted to kind of have this kind of play the feeling when you're in that area\nHave you been amazed at how many different people or businesses or services have wanted to help with this just it it's amazing to me how many different aspects of the community are involved\n[noise] Oh absolutely I mean when I was first asked to do this it was through a former band director to us from high school and I thought I was just coming into you know offer my professional expertise which at the time was architecture\nBut then it quickly evolved into this\nA huge community project in this little town in swat skim the has this strong connection to New York um but as as things started turning in as we started getting are established as a Bible once she three and as a as a legitimate organization in the eyes of the community\nYou have a slice do landscaping that you know couldn't raise his hand fast enough\nYou have growth design group that uh for their services to help us and particularly legally which you guys have heard about a year ago so earlier in the week and other community members that have offered their their income labor to help so it's really uh it's it's just the fabric of America that's coming together to help us build this project\nGot to be a great project to be involved with just the ones that the work that you do and and how that ties them to the creation of this memorial to just the fact that you can take pride in something that you are you you put your heart and soul into and and that will be viewed by it\nSome to the creation of this memorial to just the fact that you can take pride in something that you are you you put your heart and soul into and and that will be viewed by people going forward long a long pass all of us being on this planet it's gotta be a great thrill\nYou know it's wonderful to come up with the symbolism throughout the whole site and their little things we did um for instance um there was an oak tree that's\nSeven hundred and fifty four inches from the center of the monument which is how many miles at his front claws come to New York and that is kind of in the swamp oaks is one of the folks that they use on the platform after nine eleven memorial in New York I'm\nIn apple tree is really good member remember Andrea who died uh\nOn on that day from ...\nIn one of the things that I Know the ... family Andrea's parents and her sister often say to is that it's not just about to off it's not just about the hotter and family that this is so much larger than most of the Wisconsin nine eleven memorial or we want you to help\nWe have so many people that are involved in this but it's not enough we need some more healthy so please if you have a couple of times you can spare for ... for seven and nine one six twenty if you text the word tears\nC. A. R. E. S. two for one for seven and I'm One six twenty we will send you back all the information as we try to raise the beam it's a forty thousand dollar effort is phase one and they don't really know punting tend to get this off the ground and really get it flying they there are so close to just\nBreaking ground and get in Israel and so for one for seven and I'm One six twenty ... care C A R E S or you can go to W. team did not come of course and we have all the rain dreams and everything involved there as well\nHere doesn't great to meet you I I enjoy the Suzie as a man for the project look forward to seeing the completed memorial or deciding kiosk them you can help us raise the means of your teams that cares all that information on our website W teams you'd I count more than X Roger W tangent\nNine forty nine seats WGN ... we're going to continue to monitor the news from New York Washington DC I'm explosive device yeah explosive\nDevices sensor the Obamas to the Clintons to the CNN bureau in New York and now we're learning that an explosive device was also sent to the White House where it was intercepted look at the very latest on this story from ABC News\nMission packages mail to the home of former Presidents Clinton and Obama and part of the time Warner center in New York City has been evacuated after an alarm went off during a CNN broadcast another package was sent there now the White House's commenting\nThe White House statement it to ... when it called the violent impact frequently made against former President Obama Clinton and quote or their public figures there was no explicit reference to George Soros I play Thomas found earlier this week in the mailbox at the billionaire\nThat we do and\nThe funny though like we wouldn't have thought that a couple of years ago but now it's like automatically just assume it some praise diluted take from within our own country that they would\nYeah I mean again we don't know anything about the motivation of this individual or individuals that are doing this but right now we look at the the climate of the country it should not shock your surprise you\nAnd that's why I Will continue to monitor story or as I said you know had to evacuate their headquarters and they're still evacuated ... yeah I think ... ... a share on the streets broadcasting live on a on CNN right now um they were basically ushered out of their building the alarm went off to get out of their studio while they're doing a show\nAnd other broadcasting on the streets of New York heavy police presence as well\nI don't know the specifics of that of that the threat yet and we'll probably learn much more throughout the day are right here in W. teams able to get the latest on these stories but explosive devices threats made White House the Clintons the Obamas the George Soros family and also CNN\nAll of those places being threatened by this story today so we'll keep you posted on that that is number one of our for at sand the four biggest source as we see it across Milwaukee\nThe state and the world number two\nWe've talked about it before the Milwaukee health department now facing criminal investigation\nWhat is this all mean will break it down for your next right here in the ... the video on this Wednesday on WGM Jay we are in the middle of our forests handle forget the have a chance to win more symphony orchestra tickets for\nA kind of a fun thing a holiday or Hollywood celebration the music of Hollywood but you got to get them rights or write 'em down if they have to be for a time the Ford biggest stories as we've seen across Milwaukee to state in the world number two Eric it's not a new story per se Markey health department issues with their their a\nResponse to the the lead water situation the ladder roles and the impact on Milwaukee citizens health but now pending criminal investigations into that department Solomon\nTony's Lenski had issued a press release we had seen if they they sent it out to everybody questioning why Bevan Baker hadn't been subpoenaed and testifying\nBefore a city hall on the whole waters you with the health department Bevan Baker you may recall a had resigned abruptly not that long ago because of the situation where they were doing the letter Bateman process properly there is a lot of issues within the the health department\nAnd over the last few months we try to year I'm sure other news agencies have as well we've reached out Tibetan\nBaker into his lawyer aim I always get the same response back basically saying I Will let him know that you've requested an interview and usually that's all you've ever heard the ah so\n... he was questioning why wouldn't we bring humidity here from the man himself on now I should be handled in Milwaukee common council president says the reason is because there is a criminal investigation into the matter and that's why for now we have not heard from Evan Bayh\nYet I'm On the underside of all them in twenty so is he slammed the showing the hammer decision not to subpoena Baker\nAnd he he issued a statement actually saying accused him of playing politics with health and safety of our citizens delayed delayed delays seems to be the president's monster here referring to President Assad's you Hamilton the real issue is transparency conspiracy and truth the citizens and families of Milwaukee deserve so these are you going\nBack and forth on this handles and comes back\nAccused ... who ah who has already announced remarkably so but he's a twenty twenty mayoral candidate of grandstanding here's what Hamilton said I'm not interested in wasting staff and council members time create a spectacle that would approve nothing but an opportunity for you to grandstand on the issue I come down and so let's get inside here\nLet's get to the facts of the case let's find out what's who's responsible for the delays for the bad communication maybe in some cases the retribution that was rain down upon health department employees for not producing information not letting them tell people about what was happening in their departments\nBottom line is people can be affected by these decisions or lack of decision and lack of leadership\nWhether it's a shot to Hamilton are better than Baker I think Tony so let's get on to something here you have to ask these questions let's get Devon bakers some peanuts or we can find out what the real answers are I don't understand the politics understand Tony's Lewinsky's throwing his head into a race that hasn't even begun yet\nThere's always going to be that when you're talking about elected officials doesn't anyone to take a shot the Hamilton has\nSome career aspirations when it comes to a higher office hints mayor of Milwaukee\nThey're not no one's immune from this but the bottom line is the citizens of Milwaukee deserve answers on their health and if you have a health departments and then as someone who led that department the words\nAnd his conduct matter and that's why I think all of them and twenties whiskey is getting so we've also reached out the ultimate list if he wants to talk about this and I I don't think we've heard back yet but uh\nI don't I don't think that a shot the Hamilton president Hamilton is right when he says that someone is reading him his leadership he's asking tough questions\nQuestions that should be asked\nLast thing from Hamilton we're listening trying to respond a probably a properly to this crisis while you and your conferences offer only criticism and conspiracy theories wrapped in misinformation that confusion so as you're a leader I asked that you excuse yourself from the table when when the hard decisions are being made\nOr I by God's will it will excuse you again that's much empty Hamilton\nI'm not sure where he's going with that and again that's a mute the politics out of it let's get to the bottom\nOf this and figure out what is the problem here who dropped the ball what we can do and how we can fix it classic Milwaukee problem\nPolitics overcoming overriding everything else not fixing the problems that exist get the politics out of its ultimate ... he's an end\nPresident Hamilton are both welcome to come on the show and guinea their side of the story so that's number two of our for at San the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the states\nAnd the world that little worked up on that one air but I think it's important that when you when the health and safety are citizens are on on the on the table I think we have to think about what we're doing number three more positive story brewers wrap up there twenty Eighteen season with a press conference yesterday David Stearns credit counselor bringing some of that next right here in the ...\nRaces than including for governor and US Senate John McHugh checked simulate Capitol reporter at five\nRaces family who need for governor and US Senate John McHugh checked simulate Capitol reporter at five twenty Wisconsin's ethane ... animal is of course three to six right here in Louisiana Jay\nWas I was watching the world series last night between the red Sox and the Dodgers I Want I still hope that the brewers would have been in that series were watching\nI watched a little bit of it you know it's hard to get outta that baseball habit once you have it and I watched when every pension every inning either in person\nOr on the radio or on TV or the house yeah so I I'm kind of in that mode now so I watched about three or four innings last night and it really hurts you did it last night was that when it really hits you that's when it really hit me where I'm like\nOh so so I told Jean I was I was thinking as these situations were unfolding that game you know ... coming up price coming out what ... ... it would have done in that situation and\nWe went about it I mean so you're still in that mindset and and it is sad but at least um there is some closure I we played the the great piece by on one of our producers asked around him and the other day kind of wrapping up to the sounds of the season what was great to hear from David Stern and ... and yesterday as they kind of put a a bow tie and and what was an incredible twenty teens\nYeah they held the end of your news conference at Miller Park CERN says they have no regrets\nIt was a close series it was seven games and when ... got Seventy days they're generally very evenly matched teams are thought these are two very easily matched teams and certainly both teams to say that they played well enough to move on I'm at the end of the day that the Dodgers played a really good game in game seven they BS thing and they deserve to go to the world series\nSo now we look to next year right Steve who is coming\nBack from a specific standpoint additional standpoint at the major league level we have the vast majority of our team or attorney\nAnd so I don't know that I Would point a particular area or two that we see that that absolutely must be addressed but there are really the opportunities to improve our team in the off season we're going to work hard to take advantage of those opportunities I\nAh I I certainly imagine that we all shop is free training with a slightly different lucky roster than than the one we have right now perhaps a way that that we don't veggies\nAnd there are three pitchers that I Know they are very high on brand new withdrew carbon burning pretty Peralta and their futures lived right according to stern\nI think we had a high degree of belief in in those three guys um Iraq for what we saw\nIt in September and October though those three guys are fishers who we believe have the ability to be exact figures of nasally level\nUm to some extent they've already show that I face they certainly showed ... September and October last week we expected those guys to to be a big part of our future and one capacity or another and and I still think they're going to be a big our future\nSo I Know Jeff is out he's not watching the world series you you're obviously in you'll you'll take part so we'll Stearns indoor council watched before class\nIf I'll watch it it's is it going to be hateful sure but but I'll I'll watch it and and uh watch two very good teams go at it for for a chance to be a champion for\nA man I'll definitely watch it on ... percent it's look it's it's really high level baseball it's fun to see it you know from my perspective there is things to pick up on and learn and understand\nSituational lay strategically you know what happens in these games we we play all these regular season games are still much smaller sample of of playoff games\nAbout about who folks are uh if you're going to run their stuff I don't see that and that is kind of it's kind of offensive it's not um it's it's not it's not it's not ethical terms of the way a way I understood journalism ethics\nYeah for for somebody went to school for broadcast journalism I understand what I think I understand what the rules should be and disclosure and being ethical are probably some of the principal tenets of that profession do you think consolidation of the newspapers you mentioned the guy that grew up in and how that's all come together has that contribute to this\nI'm not I'm not sure about that I mean you look at their reach and it's still way down from where it used to be I mean sure they've consolidated can adults temp papers but I'm the journals down to a hundred and thirty thousand or something on Sunday that connect the you know given that the other Tanner are down I think on Sundays to a hundred and\nA fifty thousand total so I'm sure they're consolidating but uh and they're and they're one voice now ah but he you know they started they don't they don't have to reach that they used to\nHear that somebody who who died just a lot of newspaper contact mostly on line it's interesting you go to all these different websites always papers across the state and saw the same concept so you can really have the ease of that process I Want to ask you quickly about journalism and the age of Donald Trump presidents\nWho uh is I I use the term uncharacteristically on presidential in the way he communicates and do you think that's been a challenge for journalists to kind of push aside some of the by especially we've seen some Jim Acosta ... of the world the Caitlin ... already announced that seem to have a running\nBattle with the president had well two things I guess it applies to Governor Walker's while there's a lot of criticism all their Governor Walker and the ... and that is that is completely appropriate right and the longer somebody's in office as with our current governor\nMore criticism and he's going to get from journalists and as it should be so so criticism yes but when you have somebody like the New York times during the election that comes just outright and says that they see it as um if out their mission um you know I guess part of their of of of of the way they're going to proceed\nOr to actually work against Donald Trump is actually what they did that that's that's that's not right or if it's not on your editorial page I shouldn't be happening in the news pages so uh I mean I think there's a lot of admission that you have again some advocacy journalism going on\nIt does it certainly seems like that a couple of minutes left with Mike Nichols from the badger Institute there's a great piece by ritual hormones you W women's studies programs and or maybe they lack of ideological diversity going on and you say hundred courses now\nRight offered right and uh [laughter]\n... turn after ... page and read read some of these courses actually Steve I'm so you know simply undergraduate runner undergraduate courses at you W and the gender and women's studies program\nYou know race gender colonization capitalism sex and power and Greece gender migration um the female body in the world are\nYou know and then there's a we have a bunch of stuff in here about who to who the professors are and what they write but\nYou know the big question there you know if you're Madison now there's one of the biggest women and gender studies programs in the country it's second only to another Big Ten school Michigan\nAnd or is this really is this really an academic discipline or is it activism and if it is a discipline should there be as much activism as there is there there's a perspective there and I'm sure we really be be funding activism uh at at at it with our tax dollars\nShe don't eat typically the way our country works as things go in cycles are ways but in in the liberalization of of our educational institutions there is no there's no way there was no cycle it's just it's it can certainly ramps up when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting degrees and\nIt's hard to be I'm optimistic about the future of those institutions when you see that kind of course we'd be court for being generated there\nIt's tough work trying to reach out to you know a lot of kids there are there are there are kids who are fair minded or want to learn are open minded at U. W. Madison\nAs hard as it is of leaders conservatives are there are all across the country\nAnd we've written we've written about it actually but uh yeah it takes some courage to be a conservative a and a spouse or your views let let alone turnout paper that you know you're progressive professor isn't going to like Steve\nAs his record right Mike Nichols president the bathrooms and see what I I we met last weekend or how can they find out more about your your publication beginnings and all the great stories that you do\nFor sure so I can go to our website a hit some uh WWW dot badger Institute dot org and you'll find it all their um send me an email like as badger Institute dot Oregon will send you a copy I'm pushing her email list\nGood stuff good things for coming in ... that's a segment seems to be with you on WGM Jay more next on the roster looked like come spring training is there a wish list for GM David ... and upgrades Greg magic discuss that sign up for central beginning at six or seven Greg [noise]\nDo you break it down for you is all about sports and he knows are probably more than most people about the current state of affairs and the future fairs for those Milwaukee Brewers and about and the Packers are showing up\nIf you want to weigh in on our Twitter poll\nFind it a WTO O.

Steve then there was this next right here to be the amateur morning\nLA she's really with you on this Wednesday [noise]\nIn a busy day and we have the source of course from uh New York city Washington DC the explosive devices as she CNN is not flying as the devices is transported flooding at a screening facility and or if you don't know if you haven't heard that story was started earlier this week with George Soros his home explosive device on their\nLate last night early this morning one AM residents of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... New York device from there the Obamas as well so\nThat is where the storyline is right now we don't know a lot of details about maybe who sent them or what the motivation was but right now they're dealing with the with is a threat to our country and ... to some of our leaders I'm from an unknown outside source so that's the latest on that story\nThere was a it was a case cried out for justice and I believe tree so ... and her family got that justice\nWith the with the convictions just even Avery and brand of deaths you know take more of your calls intact snacks and also weigh in on Facebook at six twenty WGM Jay on Facebook and ... as I said I can I'm always talk and talk sign for one for seven nine nine one six twenty more of your calls in Tex Mex on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay\nTo give an from Central America is making its way the U.S border and President Trump has committed esophagus Jeff wider thinks she's on the right track here just explanation on this today as well Sam\nWhat's about that yesterday on the show I don't think he has a choice\nYou can't have chaos as your borders what's your border that sees about Ninety percent of the drug traffic and human trafficking problems come to Wisconsin across that border like that can't continue and they can certainly be made wars are now we're talking about the Netflix making a murderer season to does it change your mind on Stephen every skills\nMy show poll a new feature on the program on Twitter find me a WGM Jay Steve asking the question guilty or innocent right now thirty three votes fifty eight percent guilty forty two percent innocence stays open for about twenty four hours you can vote throughout the rest of the day um some\nSome comments on the acronym organs talking text line\nAs a former law enforcement officer I did and will not watch either of these programs the cases have been adjudicated hard to argue with that a mission sturgeon bay you might find this interesting people I Know in Florida who base or opinions solely on the show are mixed in their opinions\nI Know no one in Wisconsin was undecided guilty um let's see from the two six to\nWatching the series makes me feel feel that he is guilty but our court system is embarrassing the way they handle that case that it's been a big criticism right the the the somewhat shouting nature\nI'm appalled that case was prosecuted and handled and again there's no there's no absolutely perfect year things could have been done better that's the case in nearly every trial every case\nThe people that are that are working on these cases aren't perfect as either a perfect either but uh I think when you think about the every case\nYou if I look at it from the perspective of all signs point to somebody who was guilty of a crime I see Stephen neighbors face there and I don't shed any tears for him being locked up for the rest of his life\nOr from the two six to ... I was thirty six million reasons to keep every locked up after watching season ones like I Can't stomach what they did the Daschle\nAfter season to all things point to Bobby D assay Webb mode of an opportunity but the entire ... a a very clan bothers me or people who commit these types of crimes often repeat the fact that we don't have another holiday tells me they got the right guy in the job with the thirty six million bothers me\nA from the two six to watching the series makes me still feeling guilty but the court system is embarrassing me and one more from nine to old guilty but good example of the end doesn't always justify the means so interesting conversation on Facebook\nOn our airwaves an online about the the ... even every case and uh as I said but again I think he's going to be guilty for as long as I'm Alive I see nothing and I've sampled season one and I will probably sample season too as well just to have a better idea where that series is going but hum\nLoudly and clearly he's guilty of my mind's All right after the news we're going to continue update on the latest on the explosive devices found\nEither on their way and routes or ask the homes of George Soros and the Clintons and chaplain New York the Obamas\nAnd the work that's being done CNN was threatened a that's suspicious device was sent there as well causing a a\nAlmost a widespread panic as they were getting alarms as they were broadcasting Jim Shooter some of the other hosts have to actually the building them we're broadcasting from the streets outside CNN so there's a lot of uh\nInformation out there they're going to bring in the latest on that and a few minutes on the on the news coming out but in the next half hour when talking about something more technology related\nAnd it has to do with a decision\nAbout a country\nAnd in this case country Sweden but we've we've touched on that story here with Wisconsin with the company three square market and they have I think about sixty five employees now that I'm microchips imbedded in their\nHands between their some of their for finger one swing this idea has caught on in a big way and some of the ways they're using this technology\nI think are going to be a things that are some folks not all but some of the United states are going to want to think about and constant place to make life easier I'll tell you what those things are the details how that works or after the news on friday touched on another story as well\nWe talked a lot about single payer health care on the show the other day well I looked at the Democrats that are running in the house races across the country would be surprised\nWe talked a lot about single payer healthcare on the show the other day when I looked at the Democrats that are running in the house races across the country would be surprised to know that in half of those races\nThose Democrats are advocating for free health care for all that's an interesting dynamic as we look at them it's from elections November ... really voting starting already\nVoters trying to decide who to vote for a while if you knew of half the Democrats were ... were sponsoring or supporting free health care for all does that change your mindset to the independent voter the motors that really matter in this election does that make you give you pause\nSo I'll give you some details about that as well but we'll start as I said with the microchip story thousands of Swedes getting microchips inserted\nInto their hands who never thought Wisconsin would lead the way on that story but that's next you know bucks are starting to make themselves known by starting the seas were three wins and zero losses are back at it from five sir forum for a nationally televised match up with the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers Ted Davis is on the call and our coverage starts at eight o'clock tonight bus going for four\nAnd no I think they can do it you were already in the gym Jay before it gets to the microchip story just the latest as we know it's\nOn the explosive devices story that we uh broke earlier this morning so here's what we know there was an early this week there was a device are located at the home of George Soros um the\nGovernment has the law enforcement has identified packing something the Clintons in Obama's now this report that the DNC former DNC had Debbie Wasserman Schultz congresswoman from Florida her offices have been evacuated CNN's offices were evacuated the package and there\nWas apparently address the ex CIA director Brennan who has appeared on CNN\nOr the one that was taken from CNN has now are they screening facility to determine what exactly it is\nSo this is just the last three plus hours I mean this all started very early in the morning when I Am at the Clinton residents but uh the public part of this was the last several hours so that the story is fairly fresh\nNot allowed to known other than the fact that these threats in these devices were mailed to former government officials are in some cases as as the case with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nCurrents elected officials or nothing about motive or who might be responsible but I you know I've made the connection here we've seen her rhetoric in the violence ramp up from both sides and stuff on the left right wing white nationalist white supremacy groups on the rights\nDoesn't shock to me and all that we're seeing these types of stories player now we just maybe completely unrelated to politics and the rhetoric of violence that's playing out but I may not be\nAnd will will stay on that story line as it develops but a lot of breaking news\nOn today's show related to explosive devices as and I said do you do the one device removed from CNN is now at a screening facility and they will do try to determine if as was the case with the George Soros explosive device and it was rather crude and designed\nShifting topics and shifting gears slightly here and you can weigh in as well for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I Love this topic I'm not talking about technology to begin with\nA well back early on in the town you are on my ten year on T. M. J. we ... we talked about\nThe three square marketing company in Wisconsin who had asked their employees are the ones to embed a microchip microchip between their thumb and for finger to ease the process of law games with the computer or buying items in their snack bar opening closing some some of the doors at the facility\nAnd I and I love that story because I I think they had about up there a couple of hundred employees he got like fifty to sign up for staying as they've they've ramped it up like sixty five or Seventy five now that have these devices so I saw this story or from Europe\nAnd if you don't know part of the part of a thing you get to do and you're on the radio shows you've just spent a lot of time reading and I read the story about sweet\nAnd they're jumping into this thing in a big way\nAt this moment for thousands Swedes have implanted similar microchip like the one at three square market utilizes the contains information about their identity they can use these things these four thousand people to get cash like an ATM cash tickets\nThey use it for access to buildings and facilities parking and even social media and you think about\nThis technology and and the the limits and some of the questions and it raises\nAnd one of the big ones is could somebody hack into your system and your body 'cause there's things inside your own body could they do and there's companies that are looking at that as well\nJune twenty Seventeen so go back a year so we just train operate hundred people were using microchips to pay for the train trips\nEleven o'clock hour and my uh my uh show pull is now up on my Twitter accounts WGM Jake's you've if you've been follow and votes there the question is simple now that Netflix making a murder too as adults\nDo you believe Steven every is guilty or innocent and that's your choice is guilty or innocent nothing more complex than that you can boats on Twitter on my show pull that is live right now will be the results\nShooter moments in the eleven o'clock hour when we talk about an adult Lebanon seven ten o'clock hour [noise]\nBecause the stock market be getting ready for a big dive there's lots of uh signals pointing at direction in ... didn't have a bad day yesterday a relatively speaking of lost a hundred plus points but at one point it was done five hundred plus so\nWe'll spend some time and that's big trouble for the Milwaukee health department when it comes to the water situation lead in Milwaukee\nAnd are also a little bit of the brewers wrap up twenty Eighteen press conference where you're from uh the coach\nManager I should say and uh\nJust a kind of a a look back at the twenty Eighteen season from their perspective a ... at ten thirty five he joined us last week for different reasons but uh Mike Nichols president of the ... Institute gonna join me to talk about bias in the media I Hope to have in the next few weeks or look at both sides of the equation Mike is going to present his side of the\nOf the of the of the view that's what's happening in journalism in the state of Wisconsin is being impacted by some left wing groups more funding\nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison and some of the research they do into a into journalism so we'll jumping event attempt thirty five and I as I said I Want to bring in a panel of journalists probably next week to talk about their side of of what this is a debate looks like so that's coming up at ten thirty five\nAt nine o seven he joined us almost every week attorney general Brad shovel there's plenty of talk about there as well or the other big summit last night opioid met some at dinner or there's some storylines about a DNA backlog will ask them about that and how his race is going as he prepares\nFor another term as the attorney general for the state of Wisconsin uh they'll forget nine thirty five we've done it every day for the last few weeks or ... WGM daycares raised a beam\nOf today great interview with the uh designers architects of that uh the projects it will I Will do the nine thirty five eight forty five congressman Glenn Grossman will join us asking what is going to be the president today and most of nice in some sort of\nIn his neck of the woods a growth meant of course representing the Sheboygan area in the state of Wisconsin and I think in the ... and there's a little area north and west of that as well of course the breaking news\nUh and I the explosive device found it near the home of bill and Hillary Clinton a chaplain claw home a fun about one am by Secret Service and the FBI or they live there since the the president has left office in two thousand and one uh wasn't clear if they were home at the time\nThis is only one day after device was found in the mailbox and democratic billionaire George Soros and his New York home and I asked gene about this to raise the question\nAs we as we fire up the emotions and the hostility and the instability related to politics in the lead up to the mid term elections on November six\nIs this part of the story\nWe all know there's people out there that aren't stable and they can't make rational decisions\nIn as a byproduct of all that hostility and instability pushing some people too chic these kinds of actions in this case building devices explosive devices neither sending them or dropping them off\nAnd homes of people they they would like to see gone and I I I may ask this later in the show\nIs this the the new age of violence when it comes to politics we saw it in the Nineteen sixties certainly the fascination of John F. Kennedy his brother Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd you wonder if if\nHis brother Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd you wonder if if if that tension is being echoed today because of this inability to process the differences between people the understanding that we made different politics but doesn't mean we should hate each other\nSo we'll follow that story a storyline throughout the day of device founded the home of the Clintons in chapter ... about thirty miles north of New York city and uh as as details emerged we will cover that story for you right here in WGM Jay\nNow joining us in a few minutes we'll be Wisconsin congressman Glenn growth many of the debates was his opponents ask them about that will I'll ask him if he's going to meet with the president most need today\nI Know he's only only talk with the president a couple of times but uh\nIt's an interesting race a lot of money being poured in he he uh his opponent has a lot more assets than Glenn Grothman as\nUh the ... one is a popular congressman up there in a very conservative district so we'll ask them what is the outlook looks like having a November six as early voting has to be done and that's all coming up on the show today seems pretty with you on this Wednesday regiment it'd be the engine\nPay forty Morris these videos on this Wednesday [noise] joining me on the line as congressmen Fleming Brooklyn good morning congressman [noise]\nTheir mind glad to be on the show so are you going to uh meet the president's most any today by any chance\nWell we gotta decide later today I I don't know yet for sure um we have to change some other things on the calendar I may go up there\nAll right so your your opponent and yourself have now had a debate how to do\n[noise] um well I think it well well I mean for those those paying attention to this race it frustrating thing is that it might have owners that addressed a lot of issues he didn't address the last ... welfare reform is an important issue\nI think are not platitudes but we have big problems the current immigration system I'm not sure he feels the same way and suddenly it was kind of interesting I was clear my opponent came out against photo ID\nAnd while that I Do not necessarily anticipate voting on that a federal level we couldn't the future have a Congress come in and said uh it's against the law federally to ask for a photo ID and got extreme position and I was kind of surprised to Dan Cole was so adamantly opposed\nA I felt that during the debate to a\nA a simple require produce photo ID something you need sometimes for for buying drugs or you know renting movies that sort of thing and all of a sudden I saw it and then he came a little bit extreme\nThey're so on on health care like most of the Democrats are just talking about the single payer health care and did that come up in the debates and I I Would have guessed that uh your opponents identical supportive of that ... that efforts\nBy it it it kind of opposite leaves on that talks about you know bringing Medicare and I don't know how we're going to pay for\nA Medicare that we currently have if you had a lot of people to Medicare he clearly was a big advocate though for Obamacare initially and he was for a very big government healthcare planes here's ago when he ran for the state assembly a if a walkie telling the last time he ran for public office\nYour district is still conservative district and and the one that I think understand the issues probably maybe better than a lot of other districts so when you look at the race he's obviously the nephew of a former senator us a U.S senator Herb Kohl or he's outspending you correct\nYeah yeah I think is outspending you probably two to one so far so it's a very scary thing I mean there's a reason why people try to raise money money counts for something like ... to to want to be up on Green Bay TV maybe three ads for every at I have a place to be the very precarious position\nDo you do you sense that people understand the fact that he hasn't been in this district for very long\nWell yeah so you're listening you know he spent the last eight years of his life prior to coming home being in Washington and being a lobbyist\nFor some of that time in Washington he also doled out tax dollars to people so I think maybe the shadow we as a job in Washington if the person who goes around collect money he had to collect money from very left wing the old then turn around and do all out ends up thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars\nThe candidate he was doling out while overnight nine percent of the dollars he collected a turn them over to a democratic candidate so he's a very partisan a lobbyist up there and uh that's one of the reason why they were raised so much more money to be by the way he got\nThese connections with the hyper wealth in New York the hyper wealthy in California the hyper wealthy in Florida through his job with a an organization called J Street but it it's a scary situation for me um because you know people believe what they say on the air and like all we should add therefore I Would call life certainly distortions\nAnd I'm I'm afraid that people believe it and hopefully you know as we get a bar at maybe\nHopefully will approach to the point where we had on half as many ads as he as in Green Bay I don't know if we can get there but it's a scary situation\nWisconsin congressman going Rosemary I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you to hold for one second we're going to update on the on the current situation with the discovery of bomb at the home of a bill and Hillary Clinton will get back to you after the break Erich uh yeah so we\nWill take enough to hear from ABC and about sixty seconds right now where we can tell you that a U.S official says a functional explosive device was found and Hillary and Bill Clinton suburban New York home now\nThe seas newsworthy for a couple of reasons one because it's a function or explosive device but also because it's linked now to the one that was found at liberal billionaires George Soros is home yesterday so they believe there's a tie between the two on top of that now it it it it it appears that some type of device was also sent\nAnd then ten percent of the school staff are going to get adolescent mental health advanced adolescent mental health training and we're going to safety intervention teams all of this is designed to when we identify those kids that are struggling to do something about it to get services plugged into that child and to their family\nTo make sure that they don't become the kid at in junior high that's using drugs or engaging in violence an acting out will be able to prevent more kids from using drugs to deal with rent more kids from engaging in violence in our schools\nAll of that is going to make her sit safer in stronger long term\nWe're talking to Wisconsin to general read Simone W TMZ let me ask you about the story I read the other day about the DNA backlog I went to one did you get your\nTake on why that is and what we're doing in the state of Wisconsin to address then\nYeah there's a whole lot of factors that are playing a role in this one of them is a year and a half ago the FBI increase the um [noise] there there are different locations on a person's DNA strand and\nThe [noise] I'm trying to think of the right word here\nThe past we used before could only we we can only tasked with certainty to a certain number of locations will now we're able to look at more locations that gives us more certainty ... when we get a DNA in a result but that increased the number of locations that are scientists look at by forty percent which doubles\nTheir work so\nSeemed doing that we made it harder for them to produce the results that we get better science we get more of a liability and that's a good thing\nBut that increased the work we also saw we've also seen law enforcement better trained thanks to the work we've done it the O. J. to collect more evidence so at crime scenes of bringing in more pieces of evidence to help prove people guilty\nWe've also expanded the use of our of our crime lab crime scene response teams we have one and all three labs\nThat go up to crime scenes to help elect that really minute that really difficult to find evidence as a result we've got more evidence to test in my first two years in office we saw submissions to the crime lab for evidence testing go up\nBy eighty percent ... that's ... you can't expect your staff that was that was stretched all ready to handle that\nAre you going to additional staff thing in in in in budget dollars to deal with this yep\nYes we are now we didn't jump right to that because we first I transferred some other conditions from other parts of the OJ to the crime labs\nWe also created forensic biologist that are helping keep the analysts at their desks or the analysts can do their work and some other scientists can do work if you don't need the analysts to do the analyst is the most expensive most valuable person at our lab they take a year and a half to train to do DNA work and\nThere there's a lot of competition for them up there in the private sector so they get ... from us so we need to keep them at their lab do at the bench doing their work\nWe also created some uh some forensic scientist that go to the crime scenes that we can keep again keep the analysts doing their work those things started to make a difference but we've seen that the submissions have continued to grow\nSo we hired and outside an outside source the national forensic science Institute came in and conducted analysis of our lab concluded what we're doing was the right direction but we were going to need to tire more of those same people so that's what we've proposed in our budget submission that\nWe're going to put fourteen more those forensic scientists in our labs that are going to do that work and the ...\nWe've proposed in our budget submission that political fourteen more of a forensic scientists in our labs that are going to do that work and the national Science Institute believes that that will that will resolve our issues\nLast thing for you were talking to Wisconsin attorney general Brad Sherman W TMZ the breaking news story the last couple of days and said these explosive devices found that the homes\nAh George Soros yesterday today family the offices of rock Obama former presidents and a ... bill and Hillary Clinton as we've seen the attention and the instability rise in this country is this a byproduct of that do you think\n[noise] boy that it takes it to another level that it isn't the every day people kind of a girly shouting at each other at dangerous I I'm Amazed that someone was able to get those devices into places where I Would say there's pretty heavy security\nUm her quote Mr Soros as well protected should be or\nDown this ... this is frightening and we do need to tone down his rhetoric when you've got to start with got start recognizing that we found a lot of problems working together you know you talk about the opioid epidemic\nThose things are supported by ... in a bipartisan way and our state legislature the hope legislation officers school safety both bipartisan legislation in the need to focus more on recognizing that when it comes to really important things an awful lot of the time we do work together well stop yelling at each other\nLet's let let people run on the merits lets people like people talk about ideas to uh to get reelected instead of this this rhetoric that we hear this the the fly on political out this is all contributing to it\nLet me ask you if I only got about a minute left but I I Know you're you're in an election battle and and and I think experience matters is one of the reasons I have you on the shows because I respect the work that you do the hard work in law enforcement does which has been received a lot of push back in the last few years\nTalk about your race and the fact that ... and I think in my mind it comes down to experience\nWell I've been twenty nine years as a prosecutor right here in Wisconsin my own it introduces herself as a former federal prosecutor but ... prosecuted under Wisconsin law ... ever work with crime victims here\nNever done on sexual assault have in fact when we look at his record we find he only had twenty five cases assigned to him in the federal court system I've got nearly two thousand criminal cases that have handled in Wisconsin\nThat's why I got the support of one hundred and four corner elected district attorney insurers including far more Democrats\nThat support me than my opponent I've got that without the professional Police Association the troopers association the Milwaukee Police Association just today the Madison professional\nPolice officers association announced their endorsements all around the lie I've always worked together I've lived through innovation and through collaboration we brought people to the table to get real world solutions to our real world problems we put the politics aside as much as\n... my opponent and it's a his supporters want to claim I made the artist is like it's not when you have to solve problems without asking what party you voted for last friday a lecture\nWisconsin's attorney general branch I'm always look for in our conversation thanks for taking a few moments they played\nBy great to talk with them a ... a reelection battle like a lot of other folks in Wisconsin but to me it comes down to experience would take a quick break after the break we got an update from your bills yeah we'll\nGet to the time Warner's center in New York center has been evacuated because we're more of a suspicious device this is where CNN it'd be the New York bureau is located that has been evacuated this morning it comes\nOn the same day that we discovered that there had been suspicious device as an explosive devices center former president bronco bomb of former President Bill Clinton and to George Soros who was a liberal financier\nSodas as of now police everywhere were told in New York where the CNN Center is for the time Warner center is will get you an update as soon as we get it and especially in nine thirty two will have an update from New York then but anything happens before then we will bring it to you\nThank you for that up to their will keep you posted on that developmental storylines as they happen and after the break on talking about the president to use\nThe word that he probably shouldn't\nHave used that story next right here in museums and nice to see somebody with you on this Wednesday as I said well keep you posted on the latest developments ah no no ah [noise]\nIt's sort of a suspicious device near in uh in New York City so most of that you are maps discovery of explosive devices\nAt the offices for Barack Obama former presidents and the home of bill and Hillary Clinton and I asked Wisconsin attorney general ... about you know the fact that we've seen the rhetoric rising\nIs this a byproduct of that we can't make these kind of connections yet but that that notion that idea is out there and I think if we think about\nHow we deal with these political conversations and you also have to take into account\nThe mood of the country and the attitude that spawned some of these people who are frankly not of right mind and decided to take it to another level and something you have to think about the noble a spends a significant time during the today show talking about that I was a quickly talk about a story a\nSurprise me when I heard it yesterday and\nThe presidents in the words he\nChooses is often not careful with this surprises anybody Republican or democratic we all agree on that\nIt's it's something that's a lot of us on the Republican\nSide conservative side we're hoping that as a as he became more comfortable in his position he would realize the words have meaning words have power [noise]\nSo this is what he said was that or a rally Monday Night for a Texas Senator Ted Cruz a global is is a person that wants to love to do well frankly not caring about our country so much and you know what we can't have that\nYou know they have a word is sort of became old fashions called non nationalist and they say really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist okay I'm a nationalist\nNational is nothing use that word used that word\nAnd I think I'd get what the president is trying to say here\nActually could help in some way as you try to comprehend what happens\nIs there's some challenges for either want to use some challenge we have something that's bad\nBig and that heavy to to build it in a way that's one incredibly impressive to people that come up on it but also save for all the people that are that do come upon this thing\nI think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this in the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolated from\n... where he had his reign of trees that surrounds this space and making it more intimate um\nIt it\nYou can surrounded by the states you're almost cuddled are held by it\nAnd the significance of the tree that we used that surrounds it as the pear tree\nI'm On the site there was one survivor tree after the accident which was this ornamental pair for kind of taken as a symbolism of the rings around this whole space and then I'm\n\nGoing out again creates this kind of intimate space where you're not just out in this field and uh and we wanted to kind of have this kind of to play the feeling when you're in that area\nHave you been amazed at how many different people more businesses or services have want him to help with this just it's amazing to me how many different aspects of the community are involved\nOh absolutely I mean when I was first asked to do this it was through a former band director to us from high school and I thought I was just coming into you know offer my professional expertise which at the time was architecture\nBut then it quickly evolved into this\nA huge community project in this little town in ... has this strong connection to New York um but as as things started turning and as we started getting are established as a Bible once she three and as a as a legitimate organization in the eyes of the community\nYou have a flag do landscaping that you know couldn't raise his hand fast enough\nYou have growth designed group that offered their services to help us and particularly legally which you guys have heard about from jury goes so earlier in the week and other community members that have offered their their in kind labor to help so it's really uh it's it's just the fabric of America that's coming together to help us build this project\nIt's got to be a great project involved with just the ones that the work that you do and and how that ties in to the creation of this memorial to just the fact that you can take pride in something that you are you you've put your heart and soul into and and that will be viewed by people going forward long a long pass all of us being on this planet has got to\nThrill yeah it's wonderful to come up with the symbolism throughout the whole site and their little things we did\nAnd pass all of us being on this planet it's gotta be a great thrill it's wonderful to come up with the symbolism throughout the whole site\nAnd their little things we did um for instance there was an oak tree that's seven hundred and fifty four inches from the center of the monument which is how many miles in his front claws come to New York and that is kind of and the swamp oaks is one of the folks that they use\nOn the platform after nine eleven memorial in New York I'm In the apple tree is really ... remember Andrea who died uh\nOn on that day from Costco\nAnd one of the things that I Know the government family Andrea's parents and her sister often say to is that it's not just about to off it's not just about the hotter and family that this is so much larger than most of the Wisconsin nine eleven memorial I we went to your health we have so many

TMZ dot com more or less right here that'd be ...\nBy forty nine she's really what's your on WGN ... we are going to continue to monitor the news from New York Washington DC I'm explosive device yeah explosive\nDevices sensor the Obamas to the Clintons to the CNN bureau in New York and now we're learning that an explosive device was also sent to the White House where it was intercepted looked at the very latest on this story from ABC News\nHow could you nailed to the home of former Presidents Clinton and Obama and part of the time Warner center in New York City has been evacuated after an alarm went off during a CNN broadcast another package was sent there now the White House's commenting\nThe White House had been a statement in Sudan sweating Cosby attempting violent intact frequently made against for President Obama Clinton and quote other public figures there was no explicit reference to George Soros I play Thomas found earlier this week in the mailbox at the billionaire\nCan't stand yourself in a statement quotes terrorizing act I'd just stick a bowl and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law parents habits ABC News the White House packages\nIntercepted by the secret service wanted rescue Hillary Clinton at her home in New York the other address to the rock about I Can't tell them and D.C contain pipe bomb like devices they appear similar to the one said earlier this week the Democratic donor George ... ... ... ...\nSo CNN reporting that another suspicious package with a device was addressed to the White House it was intercepted added joined base in Washington DC according to law enforcement the device was similar to the one center sources home in similar to the one sent to the Clinton and Obama\nSo breaking news obviously all over the place on the other side of the story explosive devices or after the break I read the comment from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders the White House issued a statement on this as well take a quick break more than ... W GM's you\nCall the holidays are right around the corner and WGM annual holiday radio shows that are you a chance to present the night before Christmas starting Gina Miller regime manager wagon sleigh full of Wisconsin celebrities with Turner hall in downtown Milwaukee and Monday November twenty six six thirty at night\nThe live radio play will be recorded in front of a studio audience and you can be part of it but I think it's not what does that change it I ... story Christmas\nBefore one four seven nine nine one six twenty to lighten the mood a little bit on the day filled with some really stark\nScary stories from the nation's capital and New York city\nCNN um I was just watching and listening to the uh the moment the alarm went off at CNN building they were doing it shows a pseudo and and I think probably Harlow I'm ... now they're broadcasting live from the street outside their facilities uh the devices sent to the White House the Clintons the Obamas\nThankfully none of these devices have gone off but the the threat is real and we're covering ethics that's the way on the show\nSo there's been vices appear to be rudimentary but functional so something that they're they're not at least what I get from that from law enforcement is that they're not unbelievably professionally made an efficient but they are functional and can do damage\nTo the White House issued a statement was read by press secretary Sarah Sanders we condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama President Clinton Secretary Clinton and other public figures\nThese terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsibly held accountable to the fullest extent of the law the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these coward strong words from the White House\nAh ... I made the connection before and we don't know the details here so it's very early in the storyline but uh you know with the increased rhetoric\nOr the politicization of of our country or I'm not surprised we see stories like this frankly or violence has has ramped up we saw it in the times\nUh steak Alexis you squeeze another congressman we've seen it in in threats against elected officials now in this case explosive devices being nailed to the White House of as I said the residences or officers of a former presidents\nAnd are in one case of the current president at the White House so we'll say on that story throughout the ... the next couple of hours as we go to the show a couple of showing notes let me know some are going to be talking about making a murderer to that Netflix season too\nBut at my short pulled up on Twitter you can find it a WGM Jake Steve you can follow me there on Twitter simple question\nAfter watching making a murderer one or two they believe Steven every as guilty or innocent and I both choices for you in our show poll I Will give you the results live at the eleven o'clock hour or as we go on writing or a different route thirty or so so if you want to weigh in go to Twitter\nAnd signed me up W T ... Steve and a couple of other things coming up ten thirty five we'll be joined by Mike Nichols he's the president of the ... Institute and we're talking about bias in the media\nI've talked a lot about it at at the national level but he's got he's got a narrow it down to the state of Wisconsin what could be happening\nMostly gonna do a piece of a show on next week with talking to a local journalist who covers the stories that are reported in the newspapers in Wisconsin what they think about these charges and how they approach their jobs so that's all coming up on the show today Mike Nichols attempt thirty five to four uh ten\nOr will be next and well of course lead off of the story of the day explosive devices either intercepted are found a at George Soros\nAll of them and told me it was getting so we've also reached out the ultimate solution if he wants to talk about this and I I don't think we've heard back yet but uh I don't I don't think that a shot the Hamilton president Hamilton is right when he says that someone is meeting hundreds leadership\nHe's asking tough questions questions that should be asked\nLast thing from Hamilton whereas if you're trying to respond a probably a properly to this crisis while you and your accomplices offer only criticism and conspiracy theories wrapped in misinformation that confusion so as you're a leader I asked that your excuse yourself from the table when when the hard decisions are being made\nOr I by God's will it will excuse you again that's shanty Hamilton\nI'm not sure where he's going with that and again that's that's a mute the politics out of it let's get to the bottom of\nOf this and figure out what is the problem here who dropped the ball what we can do and how we can fix it classic Milwaukee problem\nPolitics overcoming overriding everything else not fixing the problems that exist get the politics out of its ultimate on skis and and the president\nHamilton are both welcome to come on the show and getting their side of the story so that's number two of our for its hand the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the states\nAround the world that little works up on our on air but I think it's important that when you when the health and safety are citizens are on on the on the table I think we have to think about what we're doing number three more positive story brewers wrap up there twenty Eighteen season with a press conference yesterday David Stearns prayed council of bringing some of that next right here to be TMZ visceral elections\nThe local races standing funding for governor and US Senate John McHugh checked similarly Capitol reporter at five twenty Wisconsin's Ehsan ... animal is of course we just six right here in Louisiana Jay\nWatching the world series last night between the red Sox and the Dodgers\nNews journalist of course we just six right here on WGN Jay was I was watching the world series last night between the red Sox and the\nDodgers I Want I still would have been in that series were watching I watched a little bit of it you know it's hard to get out of that baseball hat and what's your habit and I watched one every ... every inning either in person\nOr on the radio or on TV or the house yeah so I I'm kind of in that mode now so I watched about three or four innings last night\nDidn't really hurts you to the last night was that when it really hits you that's when it really hit me\nWhere I'm like oh so so I told Jean I was I was thinking as these situations were unfolding that game you know ... coming up price coming up what ... would have done in that situation or who we went about it I mean\nSo you're still in that mindset and and it is sad but at least um there's some closure I we played the the great piece by our own one of our producers Ashton Romney everyday kind of wrapping up to the sounds of the season what was great to hear from David Stern crank calls yesterday as they kind of put a a bow tie and what was an incredible twenty teens\nYeah they held the end of your news conference at Miller Park stern says they have no regret\nIt was a close series seven days and when ... got seven days they're generally very evenly matched teams are thought these are two very easily matched teams and certainly I think both teams just say that they played well enough to move on I'm at the end of the day that the Dodgers played a really good game in game seven eight years and they deserve to go to the world series\nSo now we look to next year right Steve who is coming\nBack from a specific standpoint physician will standpoint at the major league level we have the vast majority of our team returning\nAnd so I don't know that I Would point a particular area or two that we see that that absolutely must be addressed but there are really the opportunities to improve our team and the off season we're going to work hard to take advantage of those opportunities I\nI I certainly imagine that we all shop is free trade with a slightly different lucky roster than than the one we have right now perhaps in ways that that we don't veggies\nAnd there are three pitchers that I Know they are very high on a brand new withdrew carbon burning them pretty Peralta and their futures lip bright according to stern\nI think we had a high degree of belief in in those three guys I'm for what we saw in September and October though those three guys are fishers who we believe have the ability to attack fishers eventually level um\nTo some extent they've already shows and I said they certainly showed ... September and October size we we expected those guys to to be a big part of our future in one capacity or another and and I still think they're going to be a big future\nSo I Know Jeff is God he's not watching the world series you're obviously in you'll you'll take part so we'll Stearns indoor council wants the class\nOf ... this is a is it going to be painful sure but but I'll I'll watch it and and uh watch two very good teams go at it for for a chance to be a champion for\nA man I definitely watch it on a ... percent it's ... it's it's really high level baseball it's fun to see it you know from my perspective there is things to pick up on and learn and\nUnderstand situational lay strategically you know what happened to these games we we play all these regular season games are still much smaller sample of of playoff games\nAnd to to kind of sift through and learn from so they're they're very valuable in that regard so the ah\nThe last comments probably will here for a while from David Stern and credit counseling after last comments but as we wind up twenty eight CNN look it was a great run fantastic season or\nBy all accounts of success you everybody doesn't win the world series ever does it get to go to the world series but I came one game away from being able to do that and say that so I give my uh lots of credit to both David Stern and credit card so we're in good hands in the brewers organization\nThe owner of course mark ... as well um we're in good shape and uh actually are sports franchises in general most they were in good hands and\nA sports fans are well treated and they all all those franchises do a really great Jonathan gauging\nAnd kind of building the strength of the team some I'm encouraged by all the um the hunt for a championship though they didn't spend more on it was since twenty times so we're we're we're due for one and a baseball would have nice as we approach fifty years of brewers baseball to get there and ah as to what did they say there's always next year next season\nWe'll find out lots of good things happening at Miller Park way so that's number\nThree of our for tend to forget Milwaukee symphony orchestra tickets up for grabs are incredibly identify all four of the Fort Sam\nFirst number one the explosive devices either intercepted or discovered in Washington DC New York city in the home of George Soros earlier this week number two the dust up between shot the Hamilton\nAnd all them into these Orange County more health departments are now facing criminal investigation number three brewers coming out number four\nI met him last week as part of a a part of our W teams cares initiative but and there's other life he's the president the battery Institute Mike Nichols who's going to join us in Studio to talk about a question that I've been thinking about for a while\nAnd do Wisconsin newspapers have a hidden agenda when it comes to the stories deciding what stories they publish Mike Nichols will join us president the badger Institute after the news\nWe need your help survey for being built a new WGM daycare project raise money for gun says nine eleven memorial lots of them stuck out what it will look like and how you can help my section cares C. A. R. E. S. the Fort won four seven nine nine wants to twenty\nThirty team Jake cares present uh my first fake financial um and I first met my next guest\nAs part of his efforts for that project but today we're talking about something completely different uh Mike Nichols the president in the badger Institute joins me live in Studio mourning mourning thanks for having me on the social former we're talking about this last week as a former newspaper guy walked me through a little bit of the history so to kind of set up what we're really going to talk about which is\nIs there an agenda is their advocacy journalism going on but if somebody who worked in that industry walked me through that the historical T\nShirt I think you're talking about circulation economics and that's kind of where it starts you know um\nI started at the journal sentinel and gives me a Nineteen Ninety but if you look all the way back in Nineteen eighty five that was sort of the peak if you just look at circulation Steve\nAnd so the Sunday circulation back then was about six hundred thousand right copies and so you reach and you reached a lot of people um today it's probably about a hundred and thirty four thousand so that I think that's best and you know ... to ... you know just what's happened economically and uh so what's driving a\nA well you know the Internet largely I'm at so lots of classify advertising other types of advertising are going elsewhere going to end its and but it's also that you don't need a printing press anymore right you don't have a monopoly anymore it's not just the folks who by as they used to say hey by the barrel who now have access to a high and ways to reach people\nIt's not even not even just a shrinking as of subscribers it's to the science of papers actually shrunk as well I looked through I think goes Monday's edition\nAnd as I look for story ideas or or or things you can talk about on the show and I'm thinking there's not a heck of a last year that I can use to develop it it's a really slim down version of what my expectation is of journalism\nYeah I think in some ways um they they in some ways they do a lot with what they have actually started\nWorking on some of their investigative stuff is out of all get in Mexico resorts story I Love that\nIt is and I'm at all I just attack them I I I missed what the paper was the paper still important\nYou know I'm you're talking about the fourth estate as a central to democracy and I think that we're we we we'd be better off with what we had but we don't we don't have it anymore so they still do some good stuff but many days and I think it's just because of the economics of the industry they don't have enough people to produce anything that's of interest and then what they do produce\nRoman ... rasa looked like come spring training is there a wish list for GM Davis earns enough grades Greg magic discuss it signed up for central beginning at six or seven regular [noise]\nYou break it down for you like is all about sports and he knows probably more than most people about the current state of affairs and the future state of affairs for those Milwaukee Brewers and the bus and the Packers are showing no\nIf you want to weigh in on our Twitter poll you can find it a WGM Steve questions today based on the Netflix series you think it's even every is guilty or innocent or think about thirty folks have already weighed in yesterday's question\nWas for the president cut off aid to countries associated with the migrant caravan a fifty six percent said yes forty four percent no thanks to all those folks who voted yesterday they'll find a WTO O.

New York\nDevice from there the Obamas as well\nSo that is where the storyline is right now we don't know a lot of details about maybe who sent them or what the motivation was but right now they're dealing with the with is a threat to our country and ... to some of our leaders are from an unknown outside source so that's the latest on that story\nThis hour couple of good topics one more starts with making a murder but they're eleven thirty five\nI mentioned this story before\nIn the context of a company in Wisconsin three square markets who are embezzling microchips in their employees this is really catch it on and then look in the world\nIt's a lot more of a bigger story than it is here so far it's still an outlier in the United states but in in Sweden thousands of Swedes getting microchips remaking shipped rather I'll tell you why they're doing it\nWhy do you think it's a great idea and I'll ask you the question what do you think should be something that that should be an option for those of us the United states I said for a long time\nI don't know the timing yet maybe ten years but a lot of things will be imbedded in shifts in our probably our arms or our hands and we'll think nothing of it now whether that's five years ten years Fifteen Years Twenty years I don't know maybe a generation Twenty years\nBut uh that's going to happen and it seems to be happening already in Europe but where to start with Stephen ... now you can find us on Facebook shout out to the folks on Facebook Live you can find those at news radio six twenty WGM Jay Facebook dot com slash six twenty WGM Jay questions and comments they're\nGetting a tax us or call us at the acting a mortgage talking touch signed for one for seven nine nine one six twenty on Twitter\nI have a new Twitter pull up as you may have heard every day now I Do a show poll yesterday's was about the migrant caravans today\nSimple question when you can find me a WTO O. J. Steve on Twitter following me if you like the question is does Netflix is making a murderer one or two changed your mind on Stephen ... guilt or innocence\nAnd the question is simple guilt\nOr innocence guilty or innocent and you can weigh and I think thirty two people have already weight in right now guilty is winning fifty six percent the forty four percent\nSo the new series is out on Netflix now are making a murder to launch friday\nA latest episodes follow up the incredible run of the first season of episodes which of course tracked even Avery his case along with his nephew Brandon Bessie they're convicted in two thousand five of the homicide of photographer trees hall Bach\nAnd really have thought that since that time so\nWas that the the first season had a decade of time to deal with the second season had about two and a half years roughly of appeals court information and cases in case work on and all the the legal twisting and turning that resulted from that\nSo the question is simple do you watch Netflix series making of murder season wander now she's into and doesn't impact your feeling that Steven ... is guilty or innocent now for me\nI've sampled season one I haven't watched any of season to you but I've sampled seasonal won a few episodes have not watched one episode start to finish I have lots of friends and family who watched it and it wants to tell you their opinions on the case change after watching it\nThey may have gone in saying yeah he's guilty they may have come out of the saying you may be guilty but some of the things done in this case we're not proper\nLike letting things like planting evidence and and other suggestions that uh things weren't on the up and down with the prosecution of Stephen ... Fort won four seven nine nine one six one of the eye can a mortgage talking touched by that all the sad\nAnd my sampling of the show he's guilty they will always be guilty in my mind and I and I could watch not like season aids and still come to the same conclusion and of course I wasn't involved in the prosecution of the labor I haven't weighed all the evidence but look at this case\nI look at the circumstances and the fact that I Do know he ... a photographer to his property she disappears cars found\nBurn pits suggests to dispose of her body that way we have concessions\nAnd that's the other big piece of this is a confession to bring the bass you whether that's a real confession are already force confession\nThose spoon started by detective we can all go into those Side Story but for me it's never been about guilt or innocence I think he's guilty\nThat was sponsored by detectives we can all go into those sides stores but for me it's never been about guilt or innocence I think he's guilty\nVerdicts even every shouldn't rock the less rest of his life in a jail so\nBut you can weigh in on Twitter you can weigh in on Facebook as well and join the conversation for one for seven nine nine one six twenty second mortgage talking text like I'll take your calls read your tax seems to be with you on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay that's next\nAnd constant place to make life easier I'll tell you what those things are the details how that works or after the news I'll probably touch on another story as well\nWe talked a lot about single payer health care on the show the other day\nWhen I looked at the Democrats that are running in the house races across the country would be surprised to know that in half of those races\nThose Democrats are advocating for free health care for all that's an interesting dynamic as we look at the ... elections November sex early voting starting already\nVoters trying to decide who to vote for a while if you knew of half the Democrats\nWere ... were sponsoring or supporting free health care for all does that change your mindset to the independent voter voters that really matter in this election does that make you give you pause so I'll give us some details about that as well but we'll start as I said with the microchip story thousands of Swedes getting microchips inserted\nInto their hands who never thought Wisconsin would lead the way on that story but that's next you know votes are starting to make themselves known by starting the seas were three whims and zero losses are back at it from five sir foreign for a nationally televised mess with the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers Ted Davis is on the call and our coverage starts at eight o'clock tonight bus going for four and I know\nI think they can do it here it already and to be ... before it gets to the microchip started just the latest as we know it's on the explosive devices story that we uh broke early this morning so here's what we know there was an early this week there was a device\nAre located in the home of George Soros um the\nGovernment has the law enforcement has identified taxes and stuff to the Clintons and Obama's now this report that the DNC former DNC had Debbie Wasserman Schultz congresswoman from Florida her offices have been evacuated CNN's offices were evacuated the package sent there\nWas apparently dress ex CIA director Brennan who has appeared on CNN\nOr the one that was taken from CNN is nowadays screening facility to determine what exactly it is\nSo this is just the last three plus hours I mean this all started very early in the morning when I Am at the Clinton residents but uh the public part of this was the last several hours so that the story is fairly fresh\nNot allowed to known other than the fact that these threats in these devices were mailed to former government officials are in some cases as as is the case with Debbie Wasserman Schultz currents elected officials or nothing about motive who might be responsible but I you know made the connection here\nWe've seen rhetoric and the violence ramp up\nFor both sides\nAnd stuff on the left right wing white nationalist white supremacy groups on the rights\nWasn't shocked me and all that we're seeing these types of stories player now we just made it completely unrelated to politics\nAnd the rhetoric of violence that's playing out but I may not be in the world will stay on that story line as it develops but a lot of breaking news on today's show related to explosive devices as what I said the the one device removed from CNN has now at a screening facility and they will do try to determine\nIf as was the case with the George Soros explosive device you know it was rather crude and designed\nShifting topics and shifting gears slightly here and you can weigh in as well for one for seven nine nine one six twenty I Love this topic I'm not talking about technology to begin with\nA well back early on in the time you're ... my tenure on ... on WGN gee we talked about with three square marketing company in Wisconsin\nWho had asked their employees are the ones that have been a micro shift microchip between their thumb and for finger to ease the process of law games with the computer or buying items in their snack bar opening and closing some some of the doors at their facility\nAnd I and I love that story because I I think they had about other couple of hundred and plus he got like fifty to sign up for ... they've ramped it up like sixty five or Seventy five now that have these devices so I saw this story or\nFrom Europe and if you don't know part of the part of the ah thing you get to do when you're on the radio shows you've just spent a lot of time reading and I read the story about sweet\nAnd they're jumping into this thing in a big way\nAt this moment for thousands sleeves have implanted similar microchip like the one that three square market utilizes\nThat contains information about their identity they can use these things these four thousand people to get cash like an ATM cash tickets they can use it for access the buildings and facilities parking and even social media\nAnd you think about this technology and and the the limits and some of the questions it raises\nAnd one of the big ones is could somebody hack into your system and your body 'cause there's things inside your own body could they do and there's companies that are looking at that as well\nJune twenty Seventeen so go back a year Swedish train operate hundred people were using microchips to pay for the train trips\nYou can read the chip with a smartphone and they can come from the past years paid for their journey so that that's as easy as those deaths and again it's it's simply injected really into your your hand between your thumb and therefore finger\nA lot of large Swedish company is now I'm implanting employees with microchips as I said keys credit cards train tickets they use this is called near field communication NFC

we'll ask him if he's going to meet with the president and most any today\nI Know he's only only talk with the president a couple of times but uh\nIt's an interesting race a lot of money being poured in he he uh his opponent has a lot more assets than Glenn growth has\nA gun gross one is a popular congressman up there in a very conservative district so we'll ask them what is the outlook looks like having a November six as early voting has B. gun that's all coming up on the show today seems pretty with you on this Wednesday right here in the beauty engine\nPay for these wars these videos you on this Wednesday [noise] joining me on the line as congressman Fleming Brooklyn good morning congressman [noise] mind glad to be on the show\nSo are you going to uh meet the presidents and most any today by any chance\nWell we got to decide later today I I don't know yet for sure um we have to change some other things on the calendar I may go up there\nAll right so your your opponent and yourself have now had a debate how did that go\nUm well I think it was well I mean for those those paying attention to this race or frustrating thing is I think my owners that addressed a lot of issues he didn't address them last night you know I think welfare reform is an important issue\nI think I'm not platitudes but we have big problems the current immigration system I'm not sure he feels the same way and some of it was kind of interesting I was clear my opponent\nCame out against photo ID and while that I Do not necessarily anticipate voting on that a federal level we couldn't the future have a Congress come in and say uh it's against the law federally to ask for a photo ID I haven't got extreme position and I was kind of surprised that Dan Cole was so adamantly opposed\nA I felt that during the debate to a\nA a simple require produce photo ID something unique sometimes for for buying drugs or you know renting movies that sort of thing and all of a sudden I saw that I became a little bit extreme\nThey're so on and health care like most of the Democrats they're talking about this single payer health care did that come up in the debate and and I would have guessed that the your opponents identical supportive of that that effort\nBy it it it kind of opposite leaves on that talks about you know bringing more Medicare and I don't know how we're going to pay for\nUh the Medicare that we currently have you had a lot of people to Medicare he clearly was a big advocate though for Obamacare initially and he was for a a a very big government help here ... years ago when he ran for the state assembly a Milwaukee County the last time he ran for public office\nYour district is little conservative district in in one that I think understand the issues probably maybe better than a lot of other districts so when you look at the race he's obviously the nephew of a former senator us a U.S senator Herb Kohl or he's outspending you correct\nYeah yeah I think he's outspent you'd probably two to one so far so it's a very scary thing I mean there's a reason why people try to raise money money counts for something like ... to to want to be up on Green Bay TV maybe three ads for every at I have a puts me in a very precarious position\nDo you do you sense that people understand the fact that it really hasn't been in this district for very long\nWell yes the list there is no he spent the last eight years of his life prior to coming home being in Washington and being a lobbyist\nFor some of that time in Washington he also doled out tax dollars to people so I think maybe this shadowy is job in Washington is the person who goes around collects money it costs money from very left wing it all then turn around and Dole out ends up thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars\nThe candidate he was going out while overnight nine percent of the dollars he collected\nA turn them over to a democratic candidate so he's a very partisan a lobbyist up there and ah that's one of the reason why they will raise so much more money to be by the way he got\nThese connections with the hyper wealthy in New York diaper wealthy in California the hyper wealthy in Florida through his job with a an organization called J Street but it it's a scary situation for me um because you know people believe what they say on the air and like all we have therefore I Would call live certainly stores\nAnd I'm afraid that people believe it and hopefully you know as we get a bar at maybe\nHopefully will approach to the point where we had on half as many ads as he as in Green Bay I don't know if we can get there but it's a scary situation\nWisconsin congressman girls my I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you to hold for one second we're going to update on the on the current situation with the discovery of bomb at the home of a bill and Hillary Clinton will get back to you after the break Erich uh yeah so\nWe will take enough to hear from ABC and about sixty seconds right now what we can tell you that a U.S official says a functional explosive device was found and Hillary and Bill Clinton suburban New York home now\nThe seas newsworthy for a couple of reasons one because it's a functional explosive device but also because it's linked now to the one that was found a liberal billionaires George Soros is home yesterday so they believe there's a tie between the two on top of that now it it it it appears that some type of device was also sent\nTo former president bronco Obama so now the FBI the secret service and several other police agencies in New York and in Washington DC are taking a look into this to determine exactly what they see is how it's being done\nWe do not know exactly what this quote unquote functional explosive device is we don't know if that's a pipe bomb we don't know anything about it other than that is exactly what they're saying it is and then they have they tie to George Soros of course\nSomething that we're kind of paying attention to something we want to stay on top of\nSo let's get the very latest on this story from ABC News in New York City\nThe secret service investigating a number of suspicious packages sent to a former Democratic president a former Democratic presidential nominee in a high profile liberal donor the secret service in a statement says it intercepted too suspicious packages\nLate yesterday the secret service recovered a single package addressed a former first lady Hillary Clinton in Westchester County New York and then earlier this morning\nOn October twenty for the second package address to the former\nOpposite former residence excuse me a former president Barack Obama was intercepted by the secret service\nAs well that in Washington D. C. device into Hillary Clinton's home in Westchester County similar to the one that sent a liberal donor George Soros is home also in Westchester County New York yesterday the packages\nWere immediately identify during routine male inspections investigation of those is ongoing ... ABC News\nWe'll keep you posted on those uh updates as they come in on top of the hour new as well so I have some information on that because it's it's one of those indications that uh the violence as a part of what the national storyline has been about the extreme rhetoric instability\nAnd now direct threats when ... when it comes to explosive devices playing out in real life at the uh this latest case the the home of\nFormer President Bill Clinton and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after the break we'll be joined by congressman going growth men I Want to ask you about that that story\nBut also uh the president's conduct in the last week or so and then I'll be next write him to a gym to hear from Central America is making its way to the U.S border and President Trump has committed to stopping it Jeff Wagner thinks he's on the right track\n... explanation is today at twelve ten\nWe are joined on the phone by Wisconsin congressman Glenn Grothman for someone who's your comments on the either the developing news story\nMore explosive devices founded now the latest founded the home of bill and Hillary Clinton we saw of course yesterday George Soros what do you make of his\nHopefully up that it is going to track down this individual quickly and the prosecutor and after several on a long prison sentence I mean it's just a horrible thing that's happened in our political process I Can't imagine what it was such a thing I think over time it becomes easier to track down people do something like\nA political process I Can't imagine who would do such a thing I think over time it becomes easier to track down people do something like this and like I said I Hope we hope you find that very quickly that\nI've talked to you you don't have talked before about the conduct of the presidents and and you you frequently saying well you don't like his tweets you agree with most of his policy as I Do in most cases but I've I've noticed in the last week or so the president has played pretty fast and loose with the details\nOf storylines and I think of maybe a the the ... the caravan of migrants here man will be through Central America and some\nInternational stories as well what do you make of the presidents who doesn't seem to be in touch with the facts of the storylines\nWell a President Trump has a tendency to embellish shot in the facts and sometimes in Belgium figures and that's a frustrating thing I mean I I've only had one\nSay conversation of over met with President Trump says he was sworn in and I told them to tweets these are partly as tweets were not helping them and I do and I'm always in the uh all next time I see it might I plan on trying to talk about that with him again\nYou know the economy is doing very well I think he gets a lot of responsibility for that I think his cabinet is tremendous I think it's Supreme Court picks are tremendous he just that necessarily hurts himself and quite frankly other Republicans by some of these sweet side he's he's got tightened it up you know and uh\nIt's a it's a frustrating thing because in so many ways I found a very good job or you know e unlike these other politicians he has a sense of urgency and way too many people in Washington they have no sense of urgency I I think if you pay attention to where he is on the issues\nCompared to the average Republican I think most of your listeners will find he is much more for the average guy in the average Republican that's one thing I liked about\nOfficer school safety both bipartisan legislation ... need to focus more on recognizing that\nWhen it comes to a really important things an awful lot of the time we do work together well and stop yelling at each other let's let's what people run on their merits lets people let people talk about ideas to uh\nTo get re elected instead of this this rhetoric that we hear this but\nThe Y. and political out this is all contributing to it\nLet me ask you I only got about a minute left but I I Know you're you're in an election battle and and and I think experience matters is one of the reasons I have you on the shows because I respect the work that you do the hard work in law enforcement does which has been received a lot of push back in the last few years\nTalking about your race and the fact that ... and I think in my mind it comes down to experience\nWell I've been twenty nine years as a prosecutor right here in Wisconsin my own it introduces himself as a former federal prosecutor but he's never prosecuted under Wisconsin law you ever work with crime victims here\nIs never going to sexual assault case in fact when we look at his record we find he only had twenty five cases assigned to him\nIn federal court system I've got nearly two thousand

our guest major Garrett\nIs with us tonight CBS News the White House correspondent to talk of his new book Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books\nSubtitled the thrills ... screams ... blackouts of an extraordinary presidency I Love the prologue year what I should have learned you laid off with this quote major\nFantastic I watch it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you [laughter] so that leaves\nMe right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that an audience can feel and touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional and experience\nAnd been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you a reader I sense of personal accountability so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer\nThan in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taken the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how is he coming at you I\nWould have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence\nAnd one example of it major fantastic what is that about well it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago [noise]\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic\nThat Trump I should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean and the sense as I say in the book of adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself\nThat is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world adjunct evil exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts\nOf these great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I take more time been more\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock well\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets\nYelled at let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for this I mean let let's let's just do you look at the at the the circumstances of this man\nI I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that he is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses\nHe had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor had different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game\nAnd I write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do check black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who wants to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book and Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump and his own ways\nToppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents saying don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lights and you know that sort of thing and it's a while to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the laser different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nThat we're going to have to pause on that note I Want to come back what they look at how some other Republicans learn these lessons with major Garrett in a moment [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm Wisconsin's secretary Daphne flat\nAnd I explained in the book that it ... it was important to Trump on two levels and hard to read\nIn one respect one he was grateful that\nPresident Obama took him seriously as a president elect said you won and you're going to fill out your\nA cabinet and you're White House staff and\nYou should rely on yourself I'm paying you the respect you've already earned by being in this office with me\nAnd I'm telling you is someone who is filthy slots cabinet otherwise\nYou're going to get all this pressure and you get all these people Yankee or change to try to do things go with what you think you believe in what you think you know what works for you president elect Trump appreciated that like wow I'm already being taken seriously in giving ... given ... real practical advice by sitting president\nOn the other hand he gets this Michael Flynn saying\nHey wanders ... are you sitting up here or what is this about why are you just picking this one guy you know I like him you know he was a surrogate of mine\nI knew he fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn thought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flint nut you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information and yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember\nThere was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\nMarkup major Garrett our guest

I I I Will send us with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists yes and we talked about the mid west but something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something that we ... we ... we we have brought that up and the last couple of days when we talked about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what\nIs the strategy that they're using but in that ad it was terrorists twice here's ... interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it\nEven if you're not a farmer um you know do what they do they live near the water yeah right well how about you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works or if any of this works or if you're within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it\nThat positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her you heard her say she approves this message\nThis is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we've pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of them were crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to outdo the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know uh you know with my my party in it knows approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men\nHaving the conversation didn't say look\nShe doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme as you know in the she doesn't she's it was the term as you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they're looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric is what it is yes I've got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ...\nExtreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt because their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago their actions do outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's or maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have so\nThat's the effect is that come out with Harris or or others with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or you know inside with\nAs you're crazy Democrats she ... as she just did as having just [laughter]\nAnd which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote app and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats than it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she condones that behavioral\nLenny we saw it during the cop Kavanaugh process and and that's what I'm I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people have when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for her you know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming\nBack to bed at may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe there\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be screaming when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion yes Cabot I'll just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much better record the

anyone like three elections last I [noise]\n\nThe only guy gets elected three times style\nOf Governor Walker Governor Walker getting the shout out from a president Donald Trump the U.S in most any good crowd I actually knew some people that were out the events that it was a fantastic program one of the interesting things that came out of that was a as I was monitoring the social media feeds of a bunch of local journalists [noise]\nThis is a music was incredibly loud so loud they couldn't even think for a final report so interesting that they represent music up at those concerts or but for all intents and purposes\nHe was hitting his themes he he he shied away from some of the tougher it or if you've seen some of the other rallies but he didn't talk about common ground last night so I Want to play that piece I played it really in the show about what we all need to think about as we talk about some of the news of the day\nThere's much we can do to bring our nation's again for example those engaged in the political arena\nMust stop treating political opponents as being morally defect\n\nThe president's message I I think is a clear one now we can all arguing and I'm sure the taxes will argue that the president's contributing to some extent I agree with you\nBut I have I think we have an opportunity here now we don't know the facts of the case we don't know who sent these bombs you know the details of motivation so it's really at this point to speculation we know who they were targeted ads we'll find out I'm guessing with the great men and women I work in law enforcement the federal level what was behind this\nBut as I've watched them and commented on the the conduct of politicians elected officials whatever turn you want to use over the last two years just shouldn't surprise anybody that we're we're seeing these types of things happen\nThe the rhetoric has ramped up as I read a great piece last night about the comparison of the current climate to the Nineteen sixties civil rights movement\nOf political upheaval\nHippie generation young people I'm kind of stretching their their wings and saying you know we're going to shed a lot of the traditions I Would say before that time before the Nineteen sixties America's more formal country in the sixties\nWe shut that image Woodstock all those things and in that era the Nineteen sixties or when I was a kid\nWe saw the rise of violence protests bombings even kids you love your Madison one that are still a ... to some degree unsolved\nDo we matched that level of intensity today perhaps\n\nBut the presidents I think correctly calls out that it's it's a time for common ground it's a time for\nCivility\nAnd the last piece of players that play also put her on the show just the role of media I now have a quick comment on that and I mean they were going to break a so the last comment the president on the role of media in this current debate\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil\nAs you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nNobody is innocence here and I you know highlighted CNN but there's there's it happens at every network\nAnd I you know highlighted CNN but there's there's it happens at every network to a different degree and and maybe promoting the point of view of a different party and you you know the characters I don't have to lay him out for you\nBut when you engage in\nIn over saturation of coverage on one individual albeit admittedly the president I just days and you spend hours of your day parts hours of your schedule\nRiling up\nOr use that term riling up versus covering because I think that's in many ways what it is the words that are used in the in the reporting calling the president enraged or angry or shouting are yelling\nVersus just reporting what what was said it does take it to a different level and I think that's that in some ways can contribute to the breakdown of civility and and the level of discourse that we have in this country so that's I think the point of what the president was trying to make their that's number two of my

I think alcohol is a heck of a lot worse\nWell yeah of course I mean that's that's not\nThat's not necessarily the question you know because the the argument could be OK well known marijuana of alcohol is really bad uh marijuana is not as bad I'm not sure that's a justification but your point is we're only place in Denver you haven't seen any huge social increasing social costs are crime problems or anything like that\nNo not at all not at all\nOkay good enough for what for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to um let's see Mike in Milwaukee Mike or there'll be damned good afternoon\nHey how you doing good what do you think\nOh look I have a couple of things um I actually have a bike or I die Eddie and I know that if I'm when I tried marijuana passed it definitely helped me ... and I have bad\nPain problems so I have to take a lot of pain pill right\nSo even if I took less pain pills I smoked more that's better for my body that just for me alone secondly I think just for the state of Wisconsin to jump on it before states like Illinois\nMichigan and they legalize it I think we could be the first one and we could really make a lot of revenue and I I I think that's a big problem you know for other states if we can get there first and we would be able to make a lot more money and another\nThing I let me ask you this do you think there's a difference between medical marijuana and in recreational use of marijuana you you were talking about a couple of your physical conditions so is it one thing if you could get a prescription for medical marijuana but what about recreational marijuana that would be open to everybody\nOver the age of Eighteen or over the age of Twenty one or whatever\nI I think it goes back to\nYou know it sounds bad but I think going back to the other question the other guy with the kids I think the kids who get air why can get it already let's be honest with you when you're younger if you want to you could probably get it for a friend you knew that back then even\nSo it's more available now I think I think we I think it should be legal I really do I think it should be legalized and recreational and\nI think there should be places like bars that would have it legally or you're going to go and drink all like go smoke and enjoy it and and then below eat something and relax elite\nYou know and I think that's where people should have the choice and where the guy says alcohol the worst of all those hot worst and on your body\nAnd cigarettes are bad but I think there's other ways of ... uh taken marijuana there's\nAll the other day I mean you you go to a lot of places like ... a lot of it's you're not smoking a lot of it I Am told that it seemed like gummy bears or cookie or whatever and things like that I\nI've been to Colorado My dog and like you said it's actually\nI've heard when I'm Out there although a lot of the major crimes or the violent crime it's all a reduced anywhere even around a dispensary bomb there's no act it's really friendly there when I visited um I I it was\nLike are you at all concerned that ... ... I I I think pretty much everybody would agree that if we legalize marijuana use the the amount of marijuana use is going to go up I mean there's people who don't do it because it it it's illegal and it's got consequences\nAre do you have any concern that we might be say like raising a nation of pot heads if we if we all this\n... ... if I had to choose between raising some way you know it's going to go down you think there's going to be people who drink now that stopped to think that people are going to heroin next stop a little they're going to be a lot of other things that are worse that they're going to stop and there and do marijuana now maybe\nThat is better than if you're going to choose between someone getting too much doing too much marijuana and someone doing too much math or alcohol or any other things I guess what I'm going to treat the marijuana\nOr any other thing I guess what I'm going to shoot the marijuana\nWas that women do they know that you know if if if the choice is\nYou can be a pot head or you can be a mess head I've yeah I'm I'm I'm taking the pocket at the same time\nI I Do want to suggest that maybe as a matter of public policy maybe it's not the greatest thing in the world to encourage people to again you know raise generations of pockets I ... here's where I come down with if\nIf I were voting in the county I live and does not have one of these referendum I Would vote yes on medical marijuana and I know somebody who disagree with me on that I Would vote no on recreational use of marijuana because\nI again I think\nEven if you accept the premise that marijuana use is is no worse than alcohol use right unless and let's not even let's not even go to is it a gateway drug does it you know does it lead to harder drugs or things like that I I just\nI don't necessarily think that we we make society a better place\nBy encouraging more and more people to go out and get high recognizing that you know people do that anyways but I think if you legalize it where people will do it now having said all that\nI recognize also that I I think I'm I'm increasingly in the minority of and it it's always been one of the interesting things we talk about these these subjects\nIs that I I think I I Know you and I know that the listening audience I Know the fans of the show and I I'm always amazed that you know while we have people from all walks of life and all political spectrum\nAt it I hear from conservatives here for moderates I hear from liberals and people overwhelmingly think that it's time to legalize marijuana my guess is that these referendum Z\nPass and they passed overwhelmingly and it's certainly going to be something for the legislature to think about if nothing else\nSo if you live in one of these various counties chances are you might have a chance to weigh in a week from next Tuesday as to whether or not you think the legislatures should get on board the potty train\nOoh All right we'll take it very quick break when we come back we'll eight minutes from now we're scheduled to be joined by state senator Leah Vukmir who is running a campaign against\nTammy Baldwin you've heard a lot of ads she was with President Trump last night in the wall so area stick around twelve twenty ...

program a bill that she's touting it says socialized fantasy and it really is Kay ... for all\nAnd he doesn't even know what's in our own Dell or she does and he's afraid to say it but the bill literally dismantle Medicare Medicare Advantage for our seniors it dismantle the Medicaid program that try care program\nFor our veterans to dismantle the Affordable CARE Act and worse yet not even Canada in England it as\nIt dismantle private employer based insurance so that means that you know that three point four million people in Wisconsin will lose their private employer based insurance and meanwhile he's\nContinuing to catch a wave the big lie about pre existing condition\nYou let me let me stop you there because I I I Will tell you I I get a number of emails and text people talking about this particular campaign\nAnd there there's two two questions to people here all the time no one is the the claim the goal was making use is legal near wants to do away with\nInsurance coverage for people who have\nPre existing conditions so since I have you on the phone with what is the truth about that do you want to prevent somebody who's got cancer from being able to get insurance for somebody who's got diabetes from being able to get insurance where do you see a pre existing coverage\nI have said repeatedly that I Would fall in front of a truck before I let people go without coverage for pre existing conditions here is the truth before Obamacare went into place Jeff there's federal law that says that if you're on Medicare Medicaid or employer insurance coverage for pre existing conditions\nAnd if you weren't on one of those three we enter a scouts and we're forward thinking and we developed a health insurance risk sharing for for the remaining ... individuals if Obamacare went away today guess what that federal law is still on the books\nAnd that means that now because our unemployment rate is so low we would probably have an even smaller percentage of people that we would have to cover for pre existing conditions were committed to it I'm committed to it every Republican is committed to it is a big fat lie\nAnd it's very frustrating this is all that ... campaign has been about is one lie after another about me a nurse I don't care about people supposedly with all kinds of conditions according to Tammy Baldwin\nBut it's really easy for her to grab accuse me a quick headline instead of really looking at what she has\nA actually saying and how she misrepresenting so many of the things that I have done like I dedicated my life caring for people with cancer caring for people with mental health issues and her latest volley after me is about a dementia I have a Ninety One year old mom with dementia\nAlzheimer's and uh we even put an extra four million dollars in our budget this last session for dementia care specialist because I understand how important it is you know the list goes on and on she just has so much money that she's able to put these ads out\nWell let me to this point so let me ask you another question because these ads will be on TV either being run on on a radio station going through my program as well the other end itself or the one on preexisting conditions leave all your doesn't want to have that covered we talked about that\nThe other end is ... near doesn't want me to be able to get insurance coverage for my world chemotherapy I'm I'm a cancer patient on getting world chemotherapy and we will your doesn't want me to be able to insurance coverage for that we were once that all about\nThat is another ally that had an attendant consequences that I was concerned about that is actually born out to be true my concern about the bill was that it would limit care for patients that needed or chemo\nAnd in the end that that's exactly what happened just recently uh UNC Harvard study came out that showed that across to receive oral chemo has actually gone up\nFor some chemotherapy patients by a hundred and fifty dollars a month so because I Try to solve problems instead of trying to grab a headline and to give people false sense of hope\nThat Tammy Baldwin is able to spend her special interest money on ads that really are a lies about who I Am as an earth but I Hope that people see did it because it's been one lie after another\nAnd it is clearly not my intention as somebody who has spent my entire life as a career\nNurse working in the legislature unlike Tammy Baldwin who has been a career politician working only in the halls of government for the last thirty four years in fact\nThat's the question I posed to people who are you going to trust on health care that career politician has only walked in the halls of government or the nurse who's walking the halls and worked in the halls of some of our findings hospitals so again this is Tammy Baldwin the less extreme narrative\nShe can't answer how we're going to pay for her thirty two trillion dollar takeover of health care I've after she doesn't seem to know what's in her bell I've asked her she was incredulous when they said that her bill with\nDismantle Medicare and she said how could that be\nThe bill is called Medicare for all and I said read the bill you can call it anything you want to actually does can you imagine if a Republican had even talked about nibbling around the edges of of trying to change things on Medicare what would happen to us she is dismantling the program and I want your seniors to hear that\nOver a four year period of time I could even point them to the section of the bills paid a section and one of five to one of seven I've actually read it\nAnd they uh that isn't complete dismantling of those programs\nLet's talk to him in some respects it is interesting to me because I almost feel like we're we're back in the Nineteen nineties where the standard democratically book was to run the ads about any Republican any Republican\nWho wants to eliminate Social Security and wants to throw people seniors although you know old old people so to senior living Bush over the cliff and\nIt seems like this kind of playing out with these ads on preexisting conditions things like that let's talk about Social Security I mean are your eyes who committed to keeping Social Security is viable for people\nAnd just the president's people who are at or near their retirement should be given and we'll be following through on the promise that was given to them and\nSo on the ... the president has said that as well that he is not going to touch that\nThe president has said that as well that he is not going to touch that but once again you see how they're able to push these things out there but not\nStand accountable when at the same is true of that and they're actually proposing they things that's what's so frustrating ... is it not only are they lying but you have a complicit media and I'm not talking about you but a complicit media\nThat isn't asking these questions and so I stepped up my game and if you follow me on social media I have been calling out the media left and right\nAnd yes I'm borrowing a phrase that President fake news and it is just staggering the extent to which they

I'm Sorry what do you know well known better and unfair to them\nYou know I think it clearly was basically it was it was clearly\nIt was clearly\nA tone deaf remark\nI mean was it wasn't overtly racist I mean I guess people are going to have to decide that for themselves clearly tone deaf clearly insensitive and I do agree with you know she could have made her point\nYou you could have come up with a ton of other examples to make that point without using the reference to black face but did did she get what she deserved or is NBC\nJust using this as a pretext to I don't know I either back out of the forces of political correctness or get rid of somebody who was underperforming in the extreme okay we continue the conversation in just a minute for one for seven nine nine one six twenty it's one twenty ... inside\nThe locker room with like a copy of the factors are nine to follow in the fire we should they freeze that photo of his hands if we could in Los Angeles there's only one way they can do it all of a slave to set it also has flavor only on the home of the Packers WGM Jay\n... theater group presents Chris boating on October twenty a\nGrammy Award winning contemporary jazz artist returns to Milwaukee for one night only tickets and information for Chris boating are available online at ... dot org\nLast year the Dow Jones industrial average was up just over twenty five percent everything was so good even the self health experts forgiving on investment advice but you also saw a lot of fear\nFear of missing out in fear of crashing\nBut here's the thing here is an emotion not an investment strategy if you're making your own investment decisions emotion plays a role whether or not you realize some eight twenty teens a year that you fear out of your portfolio make an appointment with a financial engines advisor today\nAnd get a solid logical financial plan for your future one that helps take some of the fear out of the equation because self help this for ... not your financial security and retirement\nGet your financial engine dot com today [noise]\nHi I'm Brian accurate financial engines here in the Milwaukee in Appleton area I'm ready to work with you to help make your financial goals of reality for the financial engine dot com or call to six to seven ... seven zero zero through to today\n\nAttorney Tom Nichols small businesses don't always stay small\nThings that weren't important then can become very important later\nHaving experience council advise and your closely held business now can prevent unnecessary headaches down the road from headaches that can keep you from achieving your business objectives [noise] our job is to help you achieve those objectives and keep you out of trouble\nAnd you can accomplish shovels runway and on another there are a lot of little things you should do to avoid unintended pitfalls will help you do this containing extremely sensitive to how it can affect your bottom line [noise]\nHigh integrity and earn respect him in hallmarks of our farm for quite some time we've been representing businesses here in Wisconsin for over one hundred and Seventy years and will continue to be important to us is making sure nothing gets a new way success I mean with us [noise]\nBeen clients deserves good lawyers mice and their tyranny Fisher in Nichols him TSN dot com\nOne twenty two Jeff ... now I I'm not [noise]\nAgain I Am I'm not really a fan of making Kelly and never have been and\nCertainly not defending which said yesterday but it it is interesting and one of our Texas bill in Burlington makes this point remember was sent to Samantha beef came out and\nCalled the bunker Trump and then use the the C word and nothing happened to her not nothing happened to her but Megan Kelly makes references to okay how black face might be appropriate and and that's what gets her fired\nI'm you know is there in fact they double standard now I mean I I said I I think we're making Kelly said was was\nInsensitive and I think it was still considered\nI'm at the same time my guess is that it for ratings were a lot better than you wouldn't have had this reaction going on and I think NBC used as an excuse to get rid of somebody that was going to be a problem which isn't to say that I think that she didn't make mistakes here tonight in Brookfield Tom you're WTO O. J.\nHere so I feel that it's really unfortunate\nYeah so I feel that it's really unfortunate it's really a tragedy that in this society we cannot even have an\nIntelligent discussion on a topic like that all she did she did not endorse blackface she came from a perspective that when she was younger or Twenty years ago whatever in the past people used to do they're not out of disrespect but perhaps not even realizing it was a\nA insulting to black she was not endorsing that anybody do that they should simply expressing\nHer opinion convert perspective if you're certainly recognizes today it's not proper I think all was said so why should fire why are people saying that she is in some sort of\nWell okay well let me let me read you her apology um and and this is what she said yesterday she said\nI Want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard yesterday that we had a discussion here about political correctness Halloween costumes\nAnd that conversation turned to whether it's ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or white person making their face darker to make it costs to complete I defended the idea saying as long as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay well I was wrong and I'm Sorry\nSo [noise] I mean she seems to acknowledge that she thinks at least in her opinion she went over the top because she's issued an apology\nBecause she's trying to abuse the political correctness yeah I'm a white person and if somebody a white person wants to address respect to fully\nAs whatever Mart and one of the white man in the world I wouldn't care if they change their for their complex lighter why would that be an insult and I think that's what you're saying we understand though we're not going to make a joke\nOut of somebody else nationality and she understands\nSo you think she's getting the short end of the stick by them firing her definitely\nDo and has to do with the fact that she's a conservative\nYeah I think well I think I don't know that I I I I think again and I was a risk of repeating myself if she had the move that she made to NBC was a failure for for whatever reason I mean I I go back to what I said in the beginning\nThey she was very successful at Fox News doing what she did a again a smart aggressive conservative who did was a provocative tour\nTook on tough issues and that's what she made her bones that they bring her over to NBC and they they don't want her to do any of that at all and they turn into a again one of these sort of ubiquitous\nKind of I again we're we're going to have you making muffins and we're going to you know we're we're going to have you you know dancing with some of the other carry that they hired her I mean she was successful for one thing and then they tried to turn into something else and it was a flop I mean it was just flat out a a flop in general\nIf the ratings have been higher I suspect that you know maybe they would have been able to look the other way a little bit let's talk to Monica in Racine Monica delete him drink good afternoon\nHigh a monitor in my family you know I was telling your screener I watch like Kelly\nSo at least a couple of times a week and I remember when she first came over to NBC and it was that she wanted to do something different she wanted to have this kind of a show and what not it may\nI say they this segment that air I it's a little bit of surprise on her panel faces these are people that she\nRead I think that it was\nIt was it was probably the right thing to say and I don't think they were talking about you know colors like that is an example and it wasn't a great example right and I can find out that she had fired\nRight so you think you you you think it was an overreaction on NBC part\nI guess I don't pay enough attention so everybody's waiting to see what she's doing compared to others so but I liked her show I liked the diversity of the show and like when she had her panel and I you know I I I watch yourself you know pretty regularly really kind of surprised\nYeah well I I guess the question is what what next to me she's still she's half way through the sixty million dollar contracts so my guess is NBC is going to have to pay or a boatload of money then the question is does does she live back on Fox News can can you go home again and I I I don't know the answer to that\nYou know people it sells out and then people think that we're kidding when we say it's sold out and I get emails say come on Jeff I I really am a big fan of the show and I like another can you give me for tickets and the answer is no like I Can't because once they're sold out so Boyd all that hassled by your tickets right now and we'll see you on the twenty six [noise] All right\nThe the driving national story\nLast two days has been the fact that you have some psycho who has sent\nAnd I am assuming it's one person now that could be that could be false it could be a couple my guess is that it is one person\nSome psycho who has sent\nA series of crude explosive devices pipe bombs which are nasty nasty things to a number of prominent left some you had\nOne that was um sent to the home of George Soros deliver to the home of George Soros you had one that was sent the CNN um even though I think it was addressed to somebody who doesn't work at CNN but it was set the CNN\nHillary Clinton um there was one sent to her now the reports are you know Robert De Niro he of the new going on TV and saying\nBlank Trump blank Trump apparently you know one was sent to him to his residence and in a number of other places prep for President Obama et cetera et cetera\nAnd as soon as that story broke of course you had a number of people who immediately came out and said well this is all Donald Trump's fault if it weren't for the climate to President Trump has created none of this would be happening and it's Trump's faulted cetera et cetera now\nI Am confident that law enforcement is going to catch whoever did this and I think they're going to probably catch them pretty quickly my guess is that ... and again this is perhaps an experienced guest\n... my guess is that they're whoever did this has left all sorts of clues some of these packages were apparently hand delivered so you go back and my guess as you look at the tapes I Believe that they're going to catch whoever did this butts\nAnd it's going to turn out to be managed and there's some conspiracy theories out there saying well this could be you know somebody on the left who's trying to you know make Republicans look bad I my guess is not going to be that my guess is going to be some right wing nut job who is is doing this but\nThe larger question besides catching him or her prosecuting him to the fullest extent of the law and putting the guy in prison forever\nThe larger question is is this something that was caused by Donald Trump I Want to share with you an editorial that appears in today's Wall Street journal and they're going to use that as the launch you off point to ... the piece is called the politics of pipe bombs\nLindsey brought ugly news that pipe bomb like devices and mail to ... Iraq Obama Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder which followed the discovery Monday of a pipe bomb in the mailbox at the Westchester county New York home of George Soros the billionaire founder of liberal political causes\nA parent explosive devices were also discovered Wednesday at the New York offices CNN as well as at a district office of Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nThe motives of the center aren't known those devices suggest a pattern that could make them related\nThe urgent burden this Wall Street journal writing is now on the FBI the secret service and the U.S postal service to find the culprit\nLet's hope the FBI does a better job but it did in two thousand one when anthrax laced letters killed several American the FBI spent years hounding an innocent man before settling on a federal researcher who committed suicide in two thousand eight after learning he'd been charged\nEspecially so close to an election the public should discount unconfirmed leaks about suspects are motives\nClose to an election\nThere are also attempts to blame the devices on in temperate political rhetoric\nEspecially from Donald Trump we doubt this and we doubt it in the same way we never believed the attack on ...\nAnd other Republicans as they were playing baseball in Virginia in two thousand Seventeen was the fault of Bernie Sanders the man guilty of the shooting rampage was Bernie volunteer on Wednesday Mr Trump condemned the acts of sending these devices\nIf it goes off\nIf we want to make America less vulnerable to violence we do better to look past the political rhetoric and insist on exacting a higher price from those who choose violence\nThose who burned universities because they don't like speaker white supremacists to seek out engaging brawls or mass protesters breaking shock windows they all deserved the full section of the law the priority now is to find the person responsible and then ensure the offender spends a long time in prison\nAll right let's open up the phone lines for one for seven nine nine one six wedding that is the accident mortgage pocket and text line\nMortgage pocket and text long\nThe good news about this to the extent there is any good news is that none of these bombs went off that that's the good news so nobody's been hurt the bad news is that you have some psycho that is sending these two again prominent American politicians is this the fault of Donald Trump is it the fault of the climate that Donald Trump has\nCreated\nIs it fair to blame the president is it fair to blame Republicans for this for one for seven nine nine when six twenty but as the ac unit mortgage talking tech slide what do you think we discuss next between forty four this is Jeff Wagner WTO O.

we're trying to get home during rush hour and they were running into traffic caused by the Ed Sheeran concert at at Miller Park\nNow let me kind of back at it as if somebody who goes to a lot of concerts\nParking is always one of the hassles\nYou go to shows that alpine value if you went to shows it out pi valley I'm In ... in east Troy during during its heyday you knew that getting into and particularly getting out of that venue is an absolute nightmare 'cause there's one two lane road\nAnd when you have thirty five thousand people particularly leading a show at the same time it's just a nightmare you prepare\nFor the fact that it's going to take you unless you leave early\nAnd who wants to leave early in less you leave early it's going to take you an hour probably just to get out of the parking lot and went to a Jimmy Buffett show in San Diego last year last fall\nAnd it was just again it was the same sort of thing it was a political Chula Vista which is south of San Diego it was just there's like two roads going into roads going at it was an absolute nightmare but you you understand it's going to be like that\nI went to a buffet concert in Las Vegas on Saturday that that's one of the great things I was staying at the MGM grand hotel the performance was at the MGM grand\nNo problem you you you walk over you walk in Fifteen minutes you're in the venue and then ten minutes to get out it was one of the appeals of seeing shows and that sort of environment but you understand when you go to shows there's going to be a hassle with parking well apparently\nIt's concert at Miller Park that it's been a little bit controversial from the job\nBecause it was originally going to be scheduled for Tuesday but because the brewers had the game seven of Saturday Night and the time it took to do the load in for the show they couldn't get it done by Tuesday so they had to push the show back to Wednesday\nSo you had forty thousand people that were coming to Miller Park there was controversy because there were some people who had made arrangements to travel for example to Milwaukee on Tuesday and now they had to readjust their plans or give up their tickets or whatever and that's I I understand why they'd be a little bit bummed out about it\nThey have er and that's I I understand why they'd be a little bit bump doubt about that that just kind of the nature of the beast sometimes concerts do in fact get rescheduled some people were critical the brewers for not announcing it soon enough I I don't know that I think that that was necessarily fair but regardless concert was yesterday well All right by all accounts\nIt was get the concert was great\nI'm told the concert was absolutely great\nBut getting into the concert was a cluster bumble at least that's what I'm being told that here's the way for example channel for its reporting um pop star Ed Sheeran played a sold out concerts offensive park Wednesday night but plenty of people nearly missed him because of traffic getting into the parking lot\nI left the country today at three PM to make sure we'd have plenty of time to get to the park hit Ninety four or five forty five didn't get into the show until nine Fifteen because of that nightmare did you called parking the other one says it should not take me more than three hours to get to the from the airport to Miller Park is Laura something or other\nThis is ridiculous many missed the opener many merely missed the head liner\nAnd apparently I mean the conversation is it was just terrible took hours and hours and hours people are saying traffic was completely at a standstill um what apparently happened is some parking lots that we're supposed to be open weren't open it was just a a major league mess\nNow to their credit\nTo their credit the you know the brewers have have come out with a statement and the brewers what they say is we are aware that there was significant congestion on several major routes as people trapped in the middle of park last night and the process of moving cars into a lot slower than anticipated\nOur goal is always to provide the best sand experience possible that for many fans last night we did not deliver there are several factors related to hosting a concert that are different\nThan a baseball game that created challenges regardless we need to do better and we apologize for the inconvenience let's open up the phone lines for one for seven nine one six when he does the academic mortgage talk and text why\nDid you get caught in this traffic mess last night either trying to get to the

that's he acted mortgage fucking tech slide were you caught in this and how bad was it really as bad\nAs some people are indicating it was\nI don't know for sure the brewers aren't giving details I Would guess in this would just be a guess that with the rescheduling it\nMaybe they had people who were lined up to work on Tuesday\nWho didn't show up on Wednesday and they just weren't prepared for this but it it sounds like it was a complete and total mess were you caught in this and how bad was it the brewers stay there sorry for one for seven nine nine which took sweaty we discuss next to

was going to be able to get access to and from Miller Park in my opinion it was disastrous\nBecause they had half the parking staff normal that they normally have and even the staff was there didn't know was going on it wasn't the regular parking step that knew how to handle that\nVolume in my guess is part of the reason they probably half the parking staff is the baseball season is over they

right I just I I Am I grew up reading newspapers\nAnd aside from the fact that you know you you have I think a lot of the major newspapers that they have this huge bent to the left\nNevertheless I mean I I like the information I I like the newspapers at all now I I Am leaning myself from my newspaper addiction I and I told the story before about the local newspaper the journal sentinel and this isn't intended as a bash the journal sentinel but it it's a launching point for the larger topic I I've been a subscriber to the journal sentinel\nProbably you know going back to the seventies I mean when it probably after I got to college and then the paper started getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and it was a year or two ago maybe even less than that I get the renewal bill and they wanted\nFour hundred plus dollars for the newspaper seven days a week and then I say this crazy I mean I just I wasn't getting four hundred dollars worth of use out of it so I called him up and they said well Mr when you've been a subscriber forever ... will off your special deal the great three hundred thirty dollars or whatever it was I said no that's that's not it I'm it's just not getting that\nAnd then I said well how about the digital thing and it does but it's so now I signed up for digital and it's like ten dollars a quarter maybe it's not even that much it it might be because they had some special deal going or something but it's it's twenty or thirty or maybe forty bucks a year and and yes it is it took me about three days I was explaining this to I'm\nOne of my friends my last night that it it it took me about three days to adjust but you can even you get all the stuff on on the Web and if you want to see what the print edition looks like\nYou can click on that and and you could see it you can read the funniest that way and all it took me about three days to adjust to doing that and I just did fine and instead of paying four hundred dollars I you know to do it for thirty or forty or or what ever it is and still get access to that to the information\nWell there's a the badger Institute has a new report is talking about like the future of newspapers and the stories based on it talks about how they're they're failing to disclose left wing funding source it's by Dan Benson came out to a couple of days ago but the numbers\nWere just staggering to me All right now\nUh the look the journalistic which is now owned by getting that\nThen uh they own tent other newspapers besides the journal sentinel including like the apple to post crested the Green Bay press Gazette Oshkosh Northwestern ... depressed and getting at is USA Today so I mean that's why there's a lot of stuff you see in USA Today that might be in some of the local papers as well\nOkay but here's the deal Nineteen eighty five\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sunday paper in the Sunday paper is always the big one Nineteen eighty five six hundred thousand papers six hundred thousand\n[noise] after the journal sentinel merge we used to have if you're new to the area there used to be the Milwaukee Journal which was the afternoon paper and the Milwaukee sets an which was the morning paper and believe it or not they had separate staff and they actually competed against each other I mean when I started in the U.S attorney's office there was a reporter\nFrom the journal and a reporter from the sentinel but was assigned to the federal building\nAnd a reporter from the sentinel was assigned to the federal building and they actually competed and they tried to get stories and they cover trials and they did all this stuff well okay that that doesn't happen anymore but after the Nineteen Ninety five merger between the journal sentinel um the the Sunday the Sunday paper\nLet's see um was\nFour hundred and sixty six thousand so it was six hundred thousand eighty five which was the peak four hundred and sixty six thousand in Nineteen Ninety five\nSo twenty plus years\nLater grew would you like to guess you know what the Sunday journal circulation is this is according to um documents that they published in October third would you like to guess what the circulation is is now\n\nWell it's okay so what happened is\nIt it's gone down from four hundred and sixty three sixty sixty six thousand it's now that the Sunday paper circulation through official numbers are a hundred and forty three thousand papers um unofficial they say it's a hundred and thirty four thousand but at the bottom line is it's it's\nA it's down by two thirds is staggering the daily subscriptions are even more dramatic alright the daily circulation let me see I'm Nineteen eighty five\nThree hundred and Seventy five thousand people took the journal [noise] Nineteen Ninety five after ... Nineteen Ninety five after the merger three hundred and twenty eight thousand\nThey now say officially the circulation is down to Ninety nine thousand it's a third of what it was and according to the story I'm looking at\nThe real numbers are lower than that down to like eighty two thousand daily and what they're saying is that that the number of digital subscribers there's only about twenty eight thousand so that it it hasn't come close to\nReplacing you know the people who have done away with their subscriptions now I I'm a newspaper junkie I like I say I I Love it\nBut at the same time you look at this and and you look at this sort of dramatic decline and of course this is just in subscriptions\nAnd and you know the papers that people are taking it you you added to other things and of course\nYou know whether it's classified advertising and almost nobody uses the newspaper for classified advertising anymore that's all the Internet and of course then you have the the regular advertising and you do see advertising but it's a it's it's a fraction\nOf what it was again in the heyday of newspapers you look at these type of numbers\nAnd you wonder you know Ken Ken newspapers Kennedy daily newspaper ... ... can survive\nMoving forward and with this kind of bleeding of subscribers and I guess I was stunned that it has been as dramatic as it was I knew they were losing circulation I knew there were lots of people that we're bailing on this but not just talking about the journal sentinel this is true of newspapers all across the country\nFor one for seven nine nine

quarterback in a quarterback driven league how is it\nLike sort of I mean that's what makes this this this argument and then the question is orange thing is because\nUh I mean again there's there's a lot of regular season successor there is some postseason suggests albeit know Superbowl appearances and no Super Bowl you know in in the last this five year window that we're talking about but you've also done and with Aaron Rodgers so let me let me twenty six he basically will the team\nI you know into the ... he was you know an VPN twenty fourteen and even those numbers were a little bit off and twenty five and you didn't have joining also but they still ended up you know taking Arizona all the way to the limit the division around so I I don't think you could totally brush that off but uh I I

that\nYou know obviously not as good as as does the twenty twenty on the teams we did the math or after the forty niners game that it it is going to be tough to get to what you're going to get some

no Super Bowl championships it's just not acceptable I Am hurting bad by watching this team\nThis year this is going to be a terrible team and what are the what is your used to be again so how you measure success\nBlue chip team is the New England patriots comedy Super Bowl they one of two thousand and ten enough\nThere my point one of the Packers dinner due to get to that blue chip level and I don't think obviously they have the management fortitude to get it done anymore or sorry like you're done this year is your swan song that's just my opinion guys always here comic\nYeah thanks I I I don't think the Packers have squandered the best talent if the NFL if you're if you're saying talent like overall team palate backers of have that thought they have the hotel to quarterback of the NFL or if that's your point that I don't want to put words of your mouth but he was never won the super bowl without a top five defense say bring up the patriots\nEven when they have bled yard it's seems like the paper it's are all was the top five of scoring defense ears they widow Super Bowl or even reached the super now and and that's just not an area of the Packers are\nUm it was becoming more difficult and more difficult with each passing day at the end it felt to be a bona fide tough defense because the rules are favored they often have felt weighted the officer town was there the defensive talent it it's really bad spotty\nIt has um a you know what I'm trying to think I'd go back to the last decade you see this is why it's to me I mean I I'm getting a lot of frustration of the fans and I totally understand it but it's difficult for me to say it's only about Superbowl do you think about the Indianapolis Colts and the one that they had was paid man and he can't tell me they weren't successful and they only won one Super Bowl\nYou know the Pittsburgh Steelers you are yeah tell me that this decade has been unsuccessful in a decade for this deal is but then again it's been ten years since ... won the Superbowl I Know they want to ... with Ben Roethlisberger and obviously you know better than one or by you\nKnow it really been that big of a failure of the decade for Pittsburgh or or was the last decade that big of a failure considering the Colts only have one Super Bowl I don't think the world just how tough it is every once in a ring of New England but then the gold standard I mean their their head and shoulders above everybody else for for evidence Atlanta leans\nOkay I mean that they've had the same quality of quarterback plays of the backers have had this decade\nOf course the saints won the super bowl in two thousand nine they struggled to get past five hundred almost every single year last year it was an exception because they didn't have the defense they didn't have the run a game you know to resource for fifty thousand yards of the season but they never get anywhere you want to talk about wasting an opportunity to say definitely have\nThe falcons are doing it now with now right [noise]\nI get the first one Super Bowl and who was Rogers but you know getting a second Super Bowl in search of ... very difficult\nFor one for seven nine nine

the weight\nOff the waiver why are they striking there for them to get a little more protection we find somebody who is probably a poor guy can't help it anymore [noise]\nIt is actually the phone call so I'm you know it goes way beyond the first round draft pick out and get it right if you're picking you know twenty five to thirty\n... you're not getting a blue chip top five guys I I get it is the expectation levels probably a little bit different\nBut you know early on with tons of took over I mean he was finally guys the fourth round the fifth round right and that's part of building your core okay so you know the guys like David bought GRE fourth round starting book have left tackle the basic I mean that's outstanding mhm but for every one of those few and far between you have a\nTrade up at the second rub it gets real worthy third round I report you know what I mean just like\nDeveloping the core of this team have they drafted develop philosophy it just it was it done to the level that you can have it be done if you want to be a draft of developed even I think good of course just realize that as well I mean you're already cast off its Beagle he can't play for me for threat pick one of the guys right\nThat is the hold on good not they're not going to the draft picks um things um I I don't totally buy into the you know value ... late in the first round because there is plenty of talent you can find late in the first off how would you describe in the New England towards you know since two thousand two thousand to draft um you know they they I think other than the Spygate year\nTo year they had a first round pick take away but they all by the way conveniently had like a top ten pick\nBecause um they they traded one of their guys why that was the San Francisco uh but you know I mean they've been taking routinely in the last four slots writes forever it seems like they did he have the championship games ... eleven so I I I don't think that day\nBut yeah you're

much better because college football often play isn't that good either so\nI don't know what to tell you I was a guy out there on the waiver made even you know it's it's a different NFL now than it was back then because salary cap so much tighter than a lot of good players had to cast off\nThat's not the case anymore the salary cap as much looser um Kansas aren't for guys on the waiver why
