from your all your callers\nI sincerely hope that the Iraqis a beat the cubs\nI'm just tired whether good or bad or whatever the you know I'm just I'm tired of looking at the cubs\nAnd I'd like to see something new coming in and um [noise] I think that a ... example here a ball got lost in the navy to make oh ... well that's all wonderful about Wrigley and the glamour of Wrigley and all that\nCome on let's move on and let's just get a couple of good teams\nLike the brewers in the Rockies\nFight them things out here I I uh I think for duty said it best though in and anyone who follows this closely\nKnows that the brewers and the Indians are their mirrors of each other and stuff that they've done as part of building a pitching staff around\nUm fifth inning on baseball\nAnd uh the way they operate any way\nThat Greg humid grid yeah thanks for the phone call appreciate it the other interesting thing about this production is that the ... the Indians in the playoffs that's home field advantage for the brewers the Indians are the only team the brewers could face from the American league that would afford Milwaukee home field advantage\nEvery other teams got a better record than the brewers even the Oakland Athletics\nThere's a wildcard team\nThey go by record right at that point it it's not whether you want the division or anything like that uh the ease were Ninety seven when\nTeam enter in the wild card on the road because the Yankees world one hundred wind team also a wildcard team that's bunkers\nThat preview stuff jak in Racine joining us that things were holding jak\nHey Greg thanks for taking my call buddy you bet\nWell first of all I Want to tell you I'm beside you and let it ring because obviously they're the ones that do the games I think you're the best on the radio when it comes to the brewers your\nConversations are so compelling and you know the information that you come up with sometimes even new age and I I really appreciate that you're such a pleasure to listen to and I I think uh you know you needed to know that first\nOff I presume that very much jak that really does mean a lot to me\nNo my my pleasure um I'd say also you know yeah I Know the the everybody but the Indians would have a better record a have a better record than the brewers and and the American league but [noise]\nUm the reality is there are some prophetic teams in the American league that allowed these teams to bolster their records I Know that doesn't help us with the whole World Series whole field advantage but what that is the truth so yeah I just want to be clear when we're talking about the AIDS\nOr the Yankees or even the red Sox you know ... that's ... there are a little bit misleading\nI'm the one thing I wanted to mention Greg I'm ...\nI'm is you'll regarding whether the cubs whether it's the cubs are the Rockies I think a brick house was going to a place roster obviously differently um you know depending on which team you know I could I could see the cubs scenario where\nThere's just twelve players and Thirteen pictures on the twenty five ... man roster that would leave you with\nTwo catchers and three pinch hitters 'cause one of the catchers would obviously be a pinch hitter um if you didn't need it for emergency so um I can say scenario like that and that that because the cubs are so there's there's so many heavy hitters in that line up\nI'm In the brewers are going to be matchup pointed with them in terms of pitching I guess they're calling the birds and the frosty boys or whatever so I think they're going to be Thirteen frosty voice on a on the roster if it's if it's the Rockies\nIt was the Rockies I could see a scenario where you know it would be more typical where you'd have\nYou know we can't eleven pictures and\nAnd a fourteen Fifteen regular players um I'll leave you with with that those are my thoughts but I think I wrote who's going to go a long way I got I got a feeling we're going to make the world series buddy\nReally hope so exactly answer the phone call appreciate it have a great night and we're seeing a will do this coming up on the other side I Want to go through some considerations of assumptions that I made when constructing the twenty five man\nAnd uh I don't think it matters who wins tonight I really don't I don't think it matters if the cubs or Rockies advance to plead the

counting down or talked to in moments of the Milwaukee Brewers season's rough the show we landed on\nMoment number eight number aids he did watch [noise]\nApril thirtieth thousand Eighteen Josh heater electrified brewers fans and becomes the talk of the baseball world leading six five in the bottom of the seven heater into the game was one out in the brain he struck out Joey model and then gone simpler [noise]\nHe's ready to work again one to pitch swing and miss there's this slider painter comes in strikes out bottles strikes shetler and we'll go to the AIDS in Cincinnati where the breweries leading the reds six five\nYou know what was perhaps the signature performance of interest really in season it became the first pitcher in major league baseball history to record all eight hour via the strike out\nStruck yeah now\nHow 'bout Josh shade or two and two thirds innings every out a strike out and the brewers take down the Cincinnati Reds\nLeBron what's it called heater would go on to sort of ... friends on his record for most strike out by a reliever Bowman number eight April thirtieth two thousand Eighteen\nSeven ... Fridays\nThe number seven fastball friday's gift for mom\nMay thirteenth twenty eight gene how about a little gift from Freddie Peralta the brewers rookie making his ... LB they view but you have to remember what happened to force this action a stomach Gilman for the standards in the midst who's scheduled start\nRumors selected Peralta has Amanda Ripley Sanderson Peralta was supposed to start for Colorado Springs on may twelfth it was said send to Denver to make his major league debut against the Rockies and what does family understands the Twenty one year old Peralta took a no hitter into the six [noise]\nAnd here comes to to to pitch\nAnd there it is friday Peralta has moved into a tie with Steve water\nWhich will be played on Sunday either in Chicago or in Denver so unless you want to go way Miley or geo Gonzales who I presume well one of those it was going to be your game one started probably Miley\nIf you don't want to do the short rest thing you need to have a fourth starting pitcher so to me the starting pitcher for the ... D as would be you'll leave ... Davies two left these do right it's not necessarily in that order but those are the guys\nAnd then I still think you need a ... a good better get relief pitchers you're talking about a five game series with games on Thursday Friday Sunday Monday Wednesday the games on Monday and Wednesday only if necessary\nAnd there's a handful of last year Jefferson is a lock haters a LA Story of can able burns all locks to me ... even though he had a little hiccup yesterday\nTo me it comes down to this collection of damned Jennings Brandon would rough Freddie Peralta junior Guerra for the final two spots now in my initial drawing up to twenty five man roster asked him I have ... and Brandon would rough in higher Peralta and Guerra out\nThat was not an easy decision or you know I don't have to standards and involved at all fat diabetes taking that fourth starting spot and not a understand who hasn't visited over a week in fact his start was skipped and if you want to know where the brewers panda when\nIt comes to Anderson and babies don't just look at who pitched both recently it was David there was not Anderson who escaped I gather it's been okay in a in a relief role very limited opportunities but he's been fine Peralta has electrifying stuff\nAnd he's going to start playoff games at some point in his career but I just don't see him coming out of the bullpen here is a tough tough to make so I have Woodrow foods area was comfortable the under one over the final several weeks of the season\nAnd he's the guy that can give you a multiple innings just like corporate burns so tough call here but that's only have the pitching standing up so for starters\n\nAnd then you've got to eight relievers so twelve pictures for the LDS and that could change for the you know see us\nMy only hang I I think I have just about the exact same thoughts as far as Jennings and wonder if those were my last two pitchers and my only thought about Zach Davies is and it started to your point about needing maybe needing a fourth started if you even go by the ideology of who over the fourth starter could come in the game and\nClean up in the in game three or an game too and I didn't I mean who's gonna give you a couple innings in a in a fourth and fifth and sixth if need be and that's probably babies babies or or gear I'd I mean that's if you're looking at it that way that I always try to think of what the worst that could happen and who's going to clean that mess up that you trust\nYeah I you know you've got you have multiple multiple innings guys\nYou've got a couple of guys who could go to three innings I I think burns and Woodrow fit into that category and if you have to do what I think the cubs are going to do tonight and that is pull a starter into your bullpen for a one game or whatever it is I I think the brewers are less likely to do that\nBecause of the multiple into guys they have available um but that's just one component that's just the pitching there were some very interesting decisions to be made of the position players side as well we'll go through those after this on brewers tonight you're on WGM Jay [noise]\n\nBy the legendary bomb [laughter]\nWon the

you have your piece together for one for seven nine nine one six twenty be accurate\nMortgage talk in tax line I have the standards in junior Guerra Freddie Peralta Taylor Williams and Jacob arms on the outside looking in I also have Eric themes and key on ... on the outside looking in [noise] I Do have Jonathan scope is Domingo Santana on the twenty five man roster and here's why\n\nI look at the starting rotation for the cubs and I look at the starting rotation for the Rockies and what am I see I see a fine that's battering of left these\nAnd if you followed the brewers here down the stretch you realize that job scope is getting started against left handed starting pitching not ... and not private Shaw of credit salt will factor into any game I presume in the playoffs whether he starts or not\nBut the way they have used the scope against writing or excuse me get let these as a write headed sick leads me to believe that beyond the struggles that played the season and he certainly had moments\nBut it's been a struggle overall\nThat Jonathan scope would still find a place on this twenty five men roster cubs would have to starting looked at the pictures and coal Hamilton's on Lester the Rockies whatever couple in Friedland and Tyler Anderson\nNow ... Santana Roxanne is they're all this mix but we have to understand that Eric themes is no longer an everyday player and in a pinch hitting role he was only for for twenty eight\nThis season I don't think he's very comfortable in the pinch hitting role I think he's more or less agreed to do it it's an opportunity for him to get into the game he's not a good outfielder he's an okay first baseman but he's just Aguilar is have the year and quite frankly traveling salt might be a better option than Eric themes he certainly is a point\nNow where did he go Santana fits in is what you saw yesterday what you saw yesterday in Chicago is exactly why Domingo Santana will be on the twenty five man roster eight for Eighteen as a pinch hitter reliable bats off the bench are critical\nAnd Santana for all the struggles the season is minor league time and all that\nIt has come together in a pinch hitting capacity for the brewers his final month of the season Roxanne I don't I Know you love to keep a speed and his defense you you just can't get that Mitch on a twenty five man roster that kind of stuff plays well\nBut there's just not enough room for the Mitch guy\nSo those those are the toughest decisions scope St Tana they fit into that category guys like Peralta\nFit into that category guys like parole to the Rockies winter night you could certainly make an argument for Peralta given its dominance against Colorado this season\nUh and I like everything about pretty Peralta that'll be interesting to see how much influence tonight's game has on how that roster is created we may never know the answer to that question\nBut I think it's an interesting discussion point for one for seven nine nine one six twenty the accident mortgage talk in text line up you have a lot of interviews from the brewers clubhouse yesterday I'm going to get ... interview with Christian ... who I was able to catch up with a just before that team got on the bus\nYellow just had an NBC season he will be the national league MVP I really have no doubt about it the only question in my opinion is if it will be unanimous and a good catch it up a Christian you know it's following it three one when\n... first of all the at bat that pointed to early run or walk his crowd and you pick a pitcher moving back up the middle and if the guys on the board hair I mean come up in that situation\nAnd then you realize you know it's important to John or send event like this and get some good momentum going hug just trying to find a way it has been a mess for a month to find a way that's what I Do and Idaho

who joined us in Wisconsin's afternoon news today update on the wild card game the Rockies continue to lead the cubs one to nothing if we had to run in the first inning and uh I think the ... the one hits so far it gets ...\nAnd they're in the fourth any to its against freely fourth inning though correct\nI Can't even see the screen that does he get it's not an HD scream asked it believe it or not need to get a cable a bottom\nThree auto three Iraqis leaving one to nothing so what do you want here right I mean what's the ideal situation for the brewers\nI Know it's hard because you have to sort of strip your fan hats right I mean I understand the\nJust the fun the enjoyment it would be to beat the cubs and a five game series and knock him out of the playoffs\nHomes throws ...\n\n\n[noise] do you remember who he drove in this short in ... that's right with two outs in this game ... was out of vents options reliever Jordan Lyles kept the gamble live by drawing in a probable walk he would later score on that crap\nGame time to run single and four pitches later Orlando Garcia walked the pirates off to on\nLine failed\nMoment number five August twenty fours two thousand Eighteen and been able to call you or hurt them left and right during that image of liver and joined us in Wisconsin for news a little bit earlier today I should say the afternoon program is where we talked to brewers play by play man Jon celebrity\nChef I got to ask Greg was just saying I was kind of a day for the players and what not to kind of decompress a little bit is there some decompress and going on in the loving household today as well\nYeah I actually took a nap this afternoon which is nice and then I got out of the chiropractor so yeah I mean I'm I'm rocking and rolling I'm getting in the postseason shape\nYou and you see the same guy right\n[laughter] I don't think so maybe a little age gap there but a different person\nYou know it'd be celebrations are a lot of fun to Jeff in I Would love to see more of them but if there was also reality here this roster is going to look a little different by the time they take the field on Thursday some incredibly challenging decisions for credit counseling David turns to make here\nYeah I agree with you and um you know some of those long guys that are in the back of the old and probably won't be on it all season roster half of the guys that were on the regular season roster I'm probably won't be on that the post is Roger a couple of years that have had some critical at bat\nAs a member of the brewers might not be able to play well for us really have to ride the hot hands and I think at the end of the day they they know that it's coming I don't think anything is going to be a surprise this point and whoever the people are that are not going to be on a postseason Ross are they going to be in the eye out they're going to be cheering on that you're not going to be in uniform\nYou know and I assume that they're going to have for starters in this five game series otherwise you're talking about somebody going on short rest I don't think you need to do that necessarily but I think a bigger question is do you keep eight relievers or nine in this first series [noise]\nThat's a great question and I I wouldn't be surprised if they do either one um [noise] yeah you can understand why they would go nine relievers you can understand why they go they\n... the extra bench player if you're starting or short you want to maximize the fourth inning so to me I think you might add an extra long reliever as opposed to carrying an extra body to cover you a couple of the morning\nAnd go with one more offensive player that's maybe what I Would do because you're starters aren't aren't going five six seven innings in the postseason anymore unless your name's Justin reminder\nSo I I wouldn't be shocked if they go a little bit more often heavy as opposed to an extramarital\nWho does just liberating cheer for tonight in the wild card game\n[noise] [noise] I I really don't care who wins or loses the\nBrewers are running really hot in terms of really ... I I'd like to see the Chicago Cubs because you've seen them twenty times and you know what they're all about it you got a really good or rockets got scare me because you have to go to enter in that is an\nOutlier in terms of what it can do to your pitching in what I could do to your often so the brewers ... against Colorado so I feel pretty confident against the Rockies you're playing baseball but you know the cubs as well as anybody and wouldn't it be great to knock him out\nYou know I agree with you there what do you think it does ... biggest contributing ... factor here Jeff democracy September\nThe ... was the second best in terms of run out put ... in the national league they had the best ER re a teen years ray and they had a twenty seven record I mean it all came together no question but why was that they wanted to wanted to wait till September for lack of a better term\nI don't know I waited until September Greg I'm you know you have the additions in terms of actual bodies that are in your house you can you didn't have to stretch restart or if you needed to go a third time through the order you could take him out\nKind of the five and dime mentality I also think that effects quite a lot better in the month of September ... that's a huge part of why they earned run average is down\nOr because you're you're defense is making a lot of good place Travis shot finally settled into second base a little bit\nOrlando orange here was on the field a little bit more short stop\nAnd in the outfield with with Ryan Braun when he was able to do over the back half of the month of September and then within Seventy eight stricken the yesterday had a big um the defense the team played in the month of September was a huge catalyst in going twenty seven over the last twenty seven games\nWe just have a couple of seconds left Jeff is there a dark horse here maybe a player that it's going to somehow as his name into brewers lore somebody who are not talking about right now but maybe a week or two from now will forever be remembered\nWell if there's any indication of what happened yesterday Orlando Garcia might be that guy goes for the biggest here for the crew Quaker place great shortstop it might be the guy for me\nAnd there was play by play man Jeff LeBron rocky continue to lead the cubs won nothing there and the bottom of the fourth inning keep you updated on the game before we get outta here at nine o'clock tonight when we come back like opposition with ...

first round for me comes out of two basic things the brewers team must do elevate their game and consequently avoid the mistakes achieve and maintained these two things brewers will beat anyone this theories and beyond go brewers\nElevate their game is something I think the brewers did the entire month of September no team in baseball had a better record in the ... and the brewers twenty and seven it's crazy it's unbelievable\nThe only series they last the final six weeks I think it was against the pirates but he also sort of run output grow to about five and a half runs per game or to a second best in the national league ball penny away was one Ninety eight that was the best in the national league\nSo everything came together absolutely everything came together I think defensively they've been fine I I Know there was a lot of talk about you know how is this going to look with credit show moving to second in this doesn't make a lot of sense and [noise]\nYou know scopes not really a great defender of ... does he really fits\nDefensively is it I didn't stop at an issue really I don't think I think shock been remarkably consistent at second base on all the shipping they do and all that kind of stuff that I might move stock has played more shortstop yesterday that anybody right it is what it felt like\nEvery time they have their shift on our CEO was out in the middle of right field for goodness sake and was doctors will be able to guide the left side of the infield so you know what is it true position in today's major league baseball was sort of capture and\nYou know maybe first base\nAll sorts of stuff going on with the brewers to get to where they are today but yes\nGot to be clean to play the very clean baseball game yesterday in that went over the got a got a note on the text one from Paul saying Hey Greg just curious who you would like to see the brewers playing the into the U.S [noise]\nAlso if you could pick who you liked the birds to play in the world series like the birds in the world series if we get [noise] ah I think you meant brewers in birds [noise]\nUh but nonetheless I don't think they're already birds left in baseball\nBut nonetheless I don't think there are any birds left in baseball right now are they\nKnow blue jays out turtles ever got in [noise]\nOrioles were awful [noise]\nNot the same that's all that's on the bird teams right is it\nThree I think that's right okay [noise] I don't like birds\nNo birds freaked me out\nAnd I don't see us that you would I like to see the brewers boy the Braves my goodness and the Dodgers are loaded their loaded they just are in you know there's going to be a lot of talking about Clinton curse up late gr saw is amazing and yes he is he was not the best pitcher that rotation this year\nWalker dealer who pitched yesterday through a gym\nHas been the best pitcher in the Rockies usually the Dodgers organization this season\nSo that's just part of the complication either left ... left the ruins of actually had a reasonable success against her shop in the last several years but I did the Dodgers are absolutely loaded with talent\nAnd I think the Braves\nGuardian because they played in a division that\nJust sort of stumbled over itself [noise] you know they had to find the is it but this was a rebuilding team that\nOut of nowhere became a playoff team in a division winner Freddie Freeman is a good player in the Arctic is a good they've got a couple of really young and very talented players who might battle each other for rookie of the year\nBut nothing really grabbed him throughout their pitching staff that says that the team to beat\nSo I don't see it at the doctors are better team they would freak me out more in the in the you know the has been maybe any other team playing right now\nThe dismissive of the Braves who deserved especially knowing the fact that they had the Phillies who were in front of them and then tanked out and then the nationals who were just a a garbage fire this entire season I don't believe in the Braves dressing up back in\nA World Series I'll just say the Indians because they had the worst record among teams that have won a division a again the point of division where it's not a lot of big markets in Ames will\nDumped salary to rebuild it and if you play the Indians do you have home field advantage in the world series

I should tell you the ones particularly the airlines cell are generally complete trash\nThat it's almost impossible to ever successfully make a claim against one of those and I discourage you from ever clicking to buy their\nAgain if you want to buy a policy checkout to ensure my trip or get a Costco visa card they provide to use it to buy your travel provides trip insurance for free with your purchase of the travel you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nJohn who is part of our car dot com crew recently was in a store with what were you buying\nA frozen shrimp frozen shrimp\nAnd it is it okay to name the store in this case it was it sure is target and so you get to the register at target\nAnd they asked would you like to have a red card today first thing you were asked for him to get out there right now we're no they don't say that would you like to say five percent on your purchases today and every day moving forward by having a target red card\nYeah yeah we got that first though we had a we had a massive a bug you had the kids with us of course it's very difficult to go to\nTarget or any other store without a spinning up a lot of money or below it was really interesting and this was Sunday I thought you know shrimp cocktail would be good to have have football games in the afternoon\nA picked up his bags shouldn't what's on sale took it up and as the associate scanned the shrimp or there was an abnormal sound or you know not the normal people are so I looked at the the screen or the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said that attached to the bag of shrimp and call it manager or and says manager came over and us but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expire till next year\nI'm In and I said well maybe there was some kind of recall a and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible uh but you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp and there had been won in a couple of years\nI'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag of shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe a will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\nThere will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that item could end up at home you watching football and suddenly not feeling so hot\n'cause it's not 'cause your team last book because who's shrimp or or a it was like a ... in your life or you\nGot sack for big big loss anyway you never had that happen\nNo man you know I I think the manager out as I said did you know I'm Glad this happen in and I didn't end up exactly where where you are talking about Clark\nWell a good thing is that whatever what the issue with sort of the shrimp it didn't happen to you and the fact that we're going to have more and more circumstances where we don't have to worry about as much the safety of the food we eat that's nothing but for the good\nThank you very much thanks for having Brian's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Brian\nFight great thank you Brian\nHow can I be around to tell you\nAll the click and about ... fly home on to do and I can\nSell a pilot almost to the Senate and the and have

a fact but there\nIs no way no yeah\n[noise]\nSo the association are you in a mandatory association community\nYeah wow\nSo they the board of directors\nWants to sign a ten year fiber optic agreement they would stick current and future residents owners\nWith an obligation we'd go\nTill twenty twenty eight or twenty twenty nine\nBut I Would never do that never what kind of penalty is there if you know the market is changing so fast right now\nI think that like\nKind of penalty is there a break penalty or break the\n... the association would have to pay if later a resident said Newport says this is a terrible idea we gotta cancel this thing do you know what the break for years or\nIt's all this thing do you know what the break for years or I mean I Do not have to stand\nRight so how far along the border they canvassing homeowners to see a feel of after\nThe other a lot and um they all of that it took a load that going to go forward with politically and the other part that all\nThe all the time clock but I looked at the contract has not been signed all edited by then and actually the other lady that quoted like fiber optic um they claim that well you know\nThey're doing that survey that's not really filled the board and um it was only thirty five percent of the funding for that so they\nAll right well I went on to what I Do fast as you possibly can this is gonna sound so analog but I Would go print up\nAs many yard signs as she can and have people put signs in the yard note of fiber and and have a citizen uprising\nAnd in my feeling is that there's a good plan a bad idea because there is\nNo no no no and not let me tell you something there's not a chance this is a bad idea it's this is a bad idea\nAt a time of rapid technological change\nIt is a major error to enter into a decade long agreement for technology like Internet and TV that is I mean when you look how much things have changed in the last year\nWith all the people cutting the cord across the country with all the experts said would not happen for years and years and years and years and years\nThis is a rotten idea and you need to stir up the membership and get people up in arms before it

mean they're extremely wealthy and this is not an investment obviously it's a lifestyle purchase and they can afford it and it makes them happy and it just means that um\nThey they don't have as much money potentially to give to charity later to their kids or whatever\nAnd they're comfortable spending that as a lifestyle spend\nThey can do it but as if you asked me the dollars and cents of it I think it's a terrible you some money\n[laughter] yeah my sister and I are wondering if they're better option they want to be around like people in other communities that they offer things that appeal

now about paid time off\nAnd I don't know if you've heard my position on this as far as where in my opinion the role of government should be\nBecause I don't think the government should dictate to employers what paid time off policy should be with one exception and that is in the event of a health problem\nWhere there's a public health emergency let's say during a mass of influenza outbreak or something like that that the government should there should be a law in place that the government mandate paid time off for illness\nFor a time when there's the possibility of an epidemic spreading throughout the U.S population with potential great loss of life\nBut a lot of people strongly disagree with me you may or may not have heard that Microsoft is now requiring its suppliers contractors that works with to give paid family leave not family leave paid family leave\nAnd if an employer doesn't do that\nWho sell stuff to Microsoft they're kicked out as a Microsoft supplier so that's a

been formally care but I go to people's homes when they leave on vacation take care of their animals and Hillary things like that could have male and so forth\nBut looking for ways to promote this make this a more formal occupation and then grab fulltime and for me right is\nI Believe that the strongest thing you can do with a pet sitting business is have a pet sitting block\nAnd a lot that people are always in search of hey what do we do you know people have from you you see it there are people who have just\nNot strong connections to their pets and other people did their intense about them like they were happy with children\nAnd so you're looking for the people that are intense about it who want to make sure that their pet is going to be well taken care of while they're away\nAnd so putting together an advice log where you are not touting your own business you're touting your expertise and our telling people no matter where they live how\nTo pick somebody to take care of their pets what kinds of questions that they should ask where you are the expert\nAnd you use that as a platform to build up trust in interest and recognition of your own business okay so you know indirectly I think that when you're running a service business where it's so hard for people to know who to trust and where to go\nWhen you instead of saying hey use us use us use us instead you say here's advice here's the information here's guidance here's what's likely you are the price points you should be looking at\nAnd these are the choices available with various sorts of pet sitting services and you answer people's questions and throw out the guidance through social media\nThat's how I think you're going to attract a very loyal following and indirectly but ultimately with a real strong connection\nA customer base that would grow and grow and grow\nJust my opinion you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] no matter\nHow modern your family might be

the Clark Howard show Hi Nancy\nHi there how are you great thank you you are helping your husband's save for retirement is that right ... well how can I be of service to you being of service to him\nWell he is probably one man show we can do for him and why that that they also hurting the shoe\nYes for people that are self employed no employees who the hot ticket right now is what's known as a solo four one K. are self employed or why K.\nK. it allows him as a ... one person energy to have\nAn ultra low cost plan like he worked for a fortune five hundred company right it's the weirdest thing but one person company\nGets a better four one K. than a two hundred person company in his change so it's because for the so or self employed four one K. the rules were so streamlined\nThat you can go\nTo any of my really low cost companies that I Love\nAnd open a self employed four one K. and use their absolute lowest cost investments\nTo go in that self employed four one K. and the limits are very high for the money and put in\nThe advantage of the ... though is there's no paper work I mean it's like half a page and your husband in a year that things go really well can contribute roughly a quarter\nOf his revenue to the south and the year that money's tight he doesn't have to contribute at all or they just instantly becomes this out essentially becomes\nAnd it just instantly becomes this out essentially becomes a regular IRA just with much more flexible and higher contribution limits\nAnd it's very a cap on the fellow faraway chaotic put in\nI'm trying to remember is Eighteen thousand a year it's somewhere up there all\nDay and how it's going to say that one or the other can be gone by ...\n... either either can be done with the robo investing very can't yeah it's just the robo investing organization would have to offer\nA self employed or or a solo four one K. okay okay so if you went to like Charles Schwab to do it Charles Schwab has something called intelligent portfolios\nWaiting based on your husband's agents situation you pick a portfolio and they handle the mix of investing for you it's a a free version of robo investing\nOkay and he could do the self employed or so of four one K. and that might be a great option for 'em but either just doing either\nIs what's so outstanding either the so low four one K. or the south they're both winners\nCharles is with us on the Clark Howard show how Charles how are you doing\nJust fine how are you great thank you you're giving advice to a family member is that true or friend\nWell advice but also just hoping to make arrangements myself and stumbled into a challenge trying to help someone get a rental car out of state uh there's seems to be a few places where you can prepare for cars\nBut and almost all cases they require you to present the card that you use to repay rental at the rental desk when you pick it up\nWhere we see you're renting a car you're paying for it but somebody else is going to be driving the car in a whole nother state\nRight trying to help and then we'll get to a town of Christmas for example and just was\nYou're the you're asking to climb a a hill that it's going to be very hard to climb [laughter] Sanders is not set up for that because of all the problems that they have with stolen cars\nRight and so all so you would be taking on an enormous liability risk\nIf you are a renter of record in someone else's an additional driver so the whole purpose of this is to get this individual to you is it cheaper than having them fly 'cause usually flying is cheaper when\nIt's when we're trying to to get several people now living children and and Christmas gifts and all of that so it's a car would probably be the easiest [noise] uh I don't know if it matters but I'm I was actually looking into renting it in their name with them being the rent or just trying to facilitate the transaction\nBut even in that case they have to present a card to the rental agency now the the way that I could think of so they have no credit card is that right\nThey do but it just ... they don't have a lot of room on their cards so I mean\nIf you're trying to help them out you're going to pay for it right okay so that's how you do it\nRight so what you do is instead of trying to rent it on your card or anything like that\nYou make a pre payment on their credit card so that they go into a negative balance so they have a room available on their credit limit\nRight whatever the estimate of the rentals going to be and then they have the room on the card to rent it with their cart\nGotcha and then you are women ate the liability risk that you're making my heart beat too fast [laughter]\nI understand that's a good idea I should have thought of that that's that's pretty straightforward\nAnd so you don't want to pay the credit card company too far in advance of when the rental is gonna be 'cause some credit card companies as we've had color say if you\nOver pay or whatever that they they send you a check for it but if you've ever like ten days out that should work perfectly and allow the relative to rent a car\nTerrific well that that does not like the flu shot reshape out\nAll right well you have a great day and a great holiday to ... park\nDavid with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nClarke how you doing\nGreat thank you you are a Nissan Leaf driver\nYes I Am actually and I'm just great car so let me tell you the deal I bought it when they had a really good rebate on it and all that actually ... for two years now coming up at the end of the lease\nI at this point the cars essentially cost me nothing because the government tax credits pretty much paid for the least payment to this point so I I Want to buy the car\nOr the problem I'm having as it's worth on the open market probably several thousand Seventy five hundred dollars and the residuals Fifteen thousand do question number one is I Will do I do too I just go to a ... some thousand dollar\nExactly actually because they don't want your ... back so you go to them and you offer um market value and if Nissan tells you to get lost that it's\nFifteen thousand or nothing you say I'm going to get lost here's your car back\nAnd then leave says you've seen are widely available and they use vehicle market for six to eight thousand dollars depending on the mileage in the year and the condition\nAnd you just turn around and and buy another one by used one rather than have one that you have known and driven for the two years it'd be better if you could buy the one you have David 'cause you know its history you're the one who created that history\nRight so that's the other side of it you always say when you buy used car get it checked out by a mechanic but [laughter] where do you go to find a link mechanic they don't you don't do anything because you know there's there's simply no maintenance on electric\nCars are the only thing you would have a leaf checked out for his best I can tell is the remaining battery life you know that meter on the right hand side where show right filled empty he'd want to check that and the other thing is you'd want to have it checked out by a body shop\nTo see if it had been in Iraq other than that you'd be good to go as as long as the the battery is not degraded too much and it hadn't been in Iraq\nIt's just a matter of which color and leave you want to drive and by ultra cheap you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n\nFood cars close funded by and not so hard life insurance not so much having a good life insurance policy is super important but one third of people don't have it because it's really hard to buy you have to assess your needs do some research on the

I\nWouldn't want you to leave the money there unless you're a new employer had to lower costs four one K.\nWell then I guess my question is how do I know is it a low cost for a\nWhile they have to tell you okay even as a former employee they have to tell you\nSay you can call the administrator you on your statement it'll show in number\nThat you can call the administrator and say I need to know what I'm paying an administrative costs and investment fees for having the four o one K with you and you want those low cost four one K. plan all and will cost you less than one half of one percent per year\nLeft on on half of one percent right okay\nSo uh that's the standard that you should judge them planned by and if the costs are higher than that then you start thinking hey this isn't so good and if it's above one percent all and then it's a complete rip\nOkay and that's when you'd wanna look potentially a one of my low cost choices that I have a my investment guide you could move your money too or if you're a new employer offers a low cost plan then you move the money\nBut if you're older poor how big a company where you will for those Fifteen Years\nIt was a global company like uh just over for a long life\nSo that many employees it would be surprising if the costs you were paying were even as high as half a percent\nWell it's embarrassing like ...

a German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two and we haven't really gone into this any of the great detail but\nWe should point out and I suppose of the importance of these horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes I Am saying that if it's on a breed or very very special breed of a white holes are found in the end of the Spanish riding school they have been carefully bred for hunting but severe hundreds and hundreds of years or the Austria Hungarian empire\nA date performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high schooling of whole says um is very very stylized and of course if you guys are Vienna today you can see this at the palace and that bloodline was absolutely pure and the Germans grabbed the whole says\nWith the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you like an area and a kind of soup a whole is for the German army\n[laughter] absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these words is at ... at a at great important from the standpoint of just those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the master race even to and including\nHorses themselves as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of the horses and they're going to have to convert German trucks\nIn order to transport them back to American lines and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct to have this little outpost of us on may twenty miles behind the German lines uh the the other German troops in the area where of what's going on and most of them have stood down a leading them alone\nHowever there is an F s unit looting up which has been defeated elsewhere in that coming up and groups of several hundred\nOr and they say this has some kind of a red flag to a bowl of some kind of opportunity and they launch a couple of concerts it attacks on the uh the little town which has defended by only you know a couple of hundred Americans is very light weapons and the small vehicles\nAnd uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\nA fairly serious battles they've managed to break in and of course it would have led to a ... um and the other thing is it leads to the creation of something cold steel its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf bleeds unlimited learned more about stewards foreign legion\nWhile the officer was asking will come out with a guy called a captain told us to it and uh you know any officer he's very combat experience but ... with a really difficult situation is simply doesn't have enough men\nTo defend the town and the ... so he looks around and of course when they came in they all say liberate has some allied POWs there was some Americans Brits poll subs French\nExcept for and they've been working with the whole system some years and is able to um some of those were captured Jon their weapons but it's still not enough men so he intends eventually to the German prisoners that they have taken and and he re on this field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers I Would end a non check points along the side\nEx POWs and us soldiers and of course this is known to steal its foreign legion where you throw the costs accent as well into this twenty on contacts and of course when they\nUh S. S. actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts that everybody else\nTo defending the stand or the townspeople and of course the ah\nThe women and children of the stuff so it's not in ... story\nThis foreign legion that this is a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or some place it would take very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats in the in in this\nPeriod of a of a pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think that ... was that ten they rule in in this together the whole says where that ticket out if they would ask behind they would fall into the Soviet captivity the Germans can expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA if not being shot on the spot or for the other costs are they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the whole has become\nThe ... of the men and women and children

probably not to agree that Donald Trump does but there's going to be a lot of gray in this\nIn this story line going forward and I think the president will probably emphasize that's and not so much in any illegal activity but there is one of those stories is going to grow and develop New York times as thorough in what they do they don't give up easily and if you don't think there's an agenda in this story line I don't think you're paying attention so the New York times digging deep\nIncredible amount of documents going all the way back to his\nRelationship with his father and his family are

or a guy who understands how to win the playoffs baseball\nUm before we get to the news I Want to give you a number three of the forests and this is one of those stories\nThat I I think it demonstrates loudly and clearly how politics shapes real life\nPolitical discussions the back and forth the lack of action and I'm gonna call Republicans and Democrats on this and it has to do with Kimberly Clark any incentive package that's been talked about for a while going all the way back to when the legislature was in session\nWhile Republican leaders said yesterday they would take up this incentive package for Kimberley Clark the week after the election and essentially postponing any deal that would again potentially save five hundred jobs\nAnd cost taxpayers lots of money you know a little jab at the journal sentinel the headlines of Scott Walker says Senate will vote to give millions to Kimberly Clark after the election\nThat really the best headline you could have relatives that tinge with politics\nTinge to with politics\nAnd I know the stories reporters typically don't read the headlines but ... come on\nThat's a little bit too political for my taste but regardless of that Democrats then of course hate the plant Tony Evers state school superintendent who are still has an answer the questions and my wife state schools are failing even after that big report came out yesterday even though that's his job\nSaid he expressed skepticism towards the deal\nHe says our priority here is to be the workers and families with Kimberly Clark within kept in the dark and lack of certainty about their livelihoods they deserved a bipartisan solution months ago but Scott Walker and Senate Republicans can continue to play politics push this issue down the road and still can't provide any insurance is they will get anything done after election day\nYou said lawmakers should come a long term bipartisan an industry wide solution to the challenges facing the paper industry not last minute political gain gamesmanship [noise] now I said it would go after both\nRepublicans my Republican friends I think they wanted to do something I think they want to do something what I always say about elected officials leaderships hard not everybody can be big and bold cars a lot of guts vision\nEnergy\nAnd I'd get we're in the middle of a governor's race and that certainly ways into it but that doesn't prohibit ... members in the legislature from doing something about this because I Know having talked to them was on and off the record they wanted to see something done for Kimberley Clark and I can imagine the the are the folks that work for that company also want to see something done\n\nSo not a lot of bravery or her relatives here when it comes to what they're going to do and just say you're going to do something after an election well last can change election including the governor's office and it'd be bleed polls\nAnd you can do that at your own risk\nEvers is leading this race and the governor's especially admitted that the government\nEssentially admitted that the governor has also got to understand the challenge of elections and he's undefeated when\nThe networks\nDemocrats and Republicans reacted to this news there's a couple of different scenarios you won the FDA FBI has found something that warrants further investigation ask for more time there but could potentially happen I don't think it will to they're going to have this report back in in judging by the time line that says just they might be done already\nSay there's not much we can do here is was thirty five years ago there's no criminal action here it's just\nKids behaving badly and move on and then ultimately the senators have to decide what they make but here's what will happen if there is no bombshell announcement as part of this investigation Republicans will move to nominate\n\nThere's roughly four or five senators who are on the on the offense to your comments Murkowski flake mansion maybe a few other ones that are modeling around the idea of how they're going to vote on this I can tell you from reading all the accounts\nOn line this morning and last night not a lot of Republicans were happy with the president's comments yesterday in Mississippi on his rally they didn't feel as helpful to getting the votes they needed to make to really ensure Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nThat being said the president's base loves it my personal opinion not helpful no reason for it becomes spoke what a lot of other things and ah\nWhen the president goes off off the cuff often that's what you get but uh that all of a side senators have to decide what ... what happens in his nomination and how they go forward\nIf the FBI investigation comes back with no new evidence or any evidence to speak of this thing moving forward and again the barring some outlandish reasons to vote no I I Would expect this nomination to move forward and frankly the store is not going to go away\nJournalists are going to look for any opportunity here to further dig on this story but what do I know about the the journalism that's been done on this is largely gossip innuendo\nTwisting\nExpansion of a a basic storyline of I think most of us reasonable rational adults ... kids being kids\nAnd I do believe something happened to Christine Blasey Ford what'd you have to prove things in this country especially when you're talking about sexual harassment or sexual assault they have to be proved\nSanta faith system\nAnd that's not how it should work not discounting the me too movement or any of that stuff women should be listening to but not every woman should be believed just like not every man should be believed and just the last word before I close out the for a ten if we're actually going to be equal as men and women\nBoth both groups need to be protected\nAnd it's not okay for one group to slam the other one because men of always gotten their way especially white man a funny quality that's just one side doing with the other side's done forever and if you're doing that you're kind of the feeding your own purpose\nIn muddy the waters on what is

pension is one those liabilities you and I have talked about this this is a long long term issue are we making any progress in dealing with it\n[laughter] yeah no it is a long term issue a and a yes we have made some progress or so with the pension\nOr what used to happen is we'd earmark hide that are essentially make the promise to fully funded a over a thirty year period but then we keep re opening a Thirty Years' functionally we weren't going to get what\nAre we in mind that there's a couple of years ago committed to Twenty years uh enamored of Asian which means uh we're going to get funded and we're going to get funded sooner now with the short run that means we have to put in more sooner\nBut ah that has a compounding return I mean we will get a fair faster than we otherwise would which means we'll sooner get your point where every year a big chunk of the budget is going to a employees that have don't work there anymore and again it's not their fault\nA but a instead going to uh the services the taxpayers back the other thing we did is we changed the assumed rate of return and the sound wonky but most government when they have\nAny kind of fun Anton or otherwise have a bad habit of when they're budgeting they'll say well let's let's assume it's going to grow by you know eight percent nine percent ten percent a year which happens never\nAh had into what happens is if it doesn't grow by that at the end of year that just means the next year you've got to grow more right so we've been lowering our assumed rate of return a by a A N chunks we're down to a from a from eight to Seventy seven five are going down to seven and a half\nEach time we knew that it means we've got to pay more\nUh in but it also means that our assumptions are more likely to actually match the market or if people say hey the state of Wisconsin they're fully funded how do they do that\nWell they hide their pay out to the actual performance of the market so if there is a good year you get paid out more if there is a bad year you get paid out west but you don't create a whole and that's why we have a state of Wisconsin are the only fully funded pension fund and the country\nYeah which is a model and frankly more as more a local government should should follow 'em real quick ... your your proposal includes twenty three million dollar incomes how would that be in a cells across the departments of the county\nAnd well there's no department at a you know we can't really uh uh we can't really avoid cuts in any department are we a man we can get some savings essentially and\nWe always do but we asked all the department to\nAh find about one point one percent\nA of cuts in their budget I mean we ask them okay what do we need to cut to get to a valid\nBecause obviously you know we have to get to about budget so uh uh the good news for your listeners your average property tax owner is going to be flat zero property tax increase\nOf the is that you see our next that I I mean men at all or there's an increase on the go pass\nA and not the regular fair for the bus or the regular fair single right fair's flat for I think the eighth year in a row now ah and then on bus route\nOr we're going to have a few ... stops on the flyer frequent uh uh the flyers are which the ... job routes we're still we're not limiting the route\nThey're going to stop a few less time now for Ninety percent of the writers on it to get a a factor ride but obviously you know I mean if there's a few places that people can get on\nA so you know I don't think there's any cuts that people aren't really going to get yeah your I get a lot of outrage on I don't think any like no one should really be complaining about their tax bill\nA though you know the city obviously I mean their property tax on her increases about fifty bucks a PR average and they're increasing feed is about three percent\nUh but uh yeah we won't be causing your tax bill to go up but\nI keep saying it's going to look relatively painless but nobody should things that we'd solve the problem because of that\nI talked to mostly Chinese are going to be couple of minutes left I noticed that in this budget there's an increase for the correctional officers I actually worked at a why did you decide to put that in\nWell you probably know a everybody in the country that has to hire corrections officers that having a hard time attracting and retaining people partly because good news we have lower unemployment\nA partly for us or is that you know we're not able to or at least we weren't able to be as competitive and wages as we'd like to watch a couple of bucks an hour more\nUh so it's hard to keep a corrections officer that's good when they think well hey I could go to the same job for a couple of bucks an hour or more so our increase in particularly brings us in line with what the state or is that makes us a little more competitive\nAnd in a way that people don't always get that actually\nFully staffing even if it's more staff a corrections officers actually saves money because it means you don't have to bring people in on overtime which is where you're paying time and a half or so anyway you know it was tough to put in but obviously that's not a risk uh uh that that we can take if we didn't\nLast name for years we've we've well we've all heard it in and talked about the battles between the county board of McKown executives am I correct in noticing there seems to be a softening in that relationship as of late\n[noise] uh yeah I I think uh I Will tell you that this year the process of the a budget for us has been more collaborative than any of the seven years we've been there we reached out to the chairman who was very supportive of the idea of involvement\nHe had the chair of the finance gimme Luigi Schmidt a sitting in our budget hearings for mug a probably more than he imagined but the nice thing is when you've got you know one of the civil rights and the share of the Finance Committee seeing the same numbers that we're looking at kind of being involved in the decision making process\nUh there's a lot like surprises I co hosted five different a budget listening session and with members of the super ... out of a tune I've met on top of that individually with any of them you know have a cut of the invite walk through the whole budget including the chairman I think they're really won't be any surprises in it\nOr are they going to be perfect and agree on everything probably not but\nUh I my one of my sort of goal here are just sort of medical is every year the Milwaukee County board made more changes\nTo my proposed budget than the other Seventy one counties in the states combined hind to a they made a lot of changes and I'm thinking a gold number one I think we we might see last amendments than we've ever seen because I think we agree on a lot a but do you know this is the process we can build on\nStony thanks for taking a few moments we'll talk with me\nYou back I was happy to do with the\nCounty budget or when we spent so many hours on the show talking about that there'd be a softening will see a it sounds like I think somewhat encouraging they're looking at making some cause you have to do that when when revenue doesn't grow\nThe cost of doing government's doing business keeps going up you have to find ways to reduce and I think that's a a more realistic approach to that budget she's pretty with you on this Wednesday right here on WGM\nMagic how you doing now that I'm living in an extended

your report on the link between act tennis students she meant\nThere was a quote and you say this act ten is arguably one of the most consequential pieces of legislation ever enacted in Wisconsin back that up\nYeah so I think you know you look back to where the state was at the time that act was passed you think about\n'em is someone who came here from another part of the country do you think about the rust belt to think about a region of the country that is you know sort of an economic not necessarily depression or but really stagnation and you know Wisconsin you know to some extent despite the reforms that Tommy Thompson and other folks in the nineties was a big part of that\nWas suffering on both in terms of uh you know the state finances at a huge budget deficit and didn't have this sort of environment that was conducive to bring people in and encouraging workforce growth\nUm and I think you know when you when you look at the circumstances and went to act was passed relative to our neighboring states like Illinois in states that nature um it was a tremendous effect in terms of um\nYou know Government Reform improving the budget situation and also you know you could look at it as a brute blueprint\nFor things like Janet that have come down at the national level in subsequent years the idea that you know workers should be empowered to make their own decisions and workers should not be forced to be a part of the union all those things to some extent Wisconsin is a is a um sort of one of the landmark states where those things were first shown to be effective\nWe both know tens of political hot potato it's it's it's part of the current climate with the with the race for governor Tony Evers superintendent of public instruction Governor Scott Walker [noise] I Know where they stand what do you think we know and understand where the public stance on this issue so\nThat's an interesting uh interesting question we did a poll earlier in the year and one of the questions that we asked was\nWhat do you think I tend to fact has been on teachers and students and we found that it was obviously hyper partisan if you're a Democrat you tended to say on that kind of had a negative impact but I think we could have asked people as act and had a negative or positive impact on school lunches and Democrats would have still said that it's that it's a you know as a strong negative impact\nUm whether things like this can sort of move the needle you know I'm not I'm not necessarily sure but uh I think the more evidence we get out there that shows the facts rather than just the the rhetoric but we get to the actual facts and that's what we try to do with this research or the more that can be out there for people to be exposed to 'em and sort of moves us in a better direction for a for a for the debates\nSome ... some of the education of the public there actually is a positive benefit on student achievement and in a positive impact of ... where do we see this going work were once the public starts to understand this what could happen for school board school districts ... when they kind of understand they have more opportunity to teach kids\nSo I think you know as we move into the playoffs for for baseball we we know what's worked all you're right the brewers I'm a team that's um\nYou know how to start or go all game and if we win the playoffs and suddenly so now we're going to have requires just seem to pitch nine innings we wouldn't necessarily think that's the way to go and as we build the evidence that act has an effect of not just on the financial side but effective\nFor students effective across the board to say that we need to go into completely opposite direction just doesn't make any sense and I think when we put this piece of the puzzle this this last year when the ... supporters that ten that students have benefited from back ten um there's really not much reason that we can point to that folks like Uber's um should be advocating for appeal\nIt's interesting that the the the view of politics of this both sides argue that their their best interest or the students but clearly there's there's other people in this equation right there's the school board the school districts that the parents in that district so much of this was education we have to be able to tell people\nWith real research real knowledge that there can be a positive benefit here these kinds of studies I think point isn't the right direction what's the next step here\nSo I think are as we as we look at once\nHere so I think are as we as we look at what has been effective so we looked at whether districts that actually implement that form ... see the ten inform whether they actually have checked the boxes and they have in fact implemented the than I Am not if that happens\nBut yeah but so they've implemented it in terms of the law but not all districts have gone as far as they can in terms of doing things like merit pay in terms of things like rewarding teachers that are more effective in the classroom with higher salaries\nI mean you know one thing we might do with the further investigation will be to see the extent overall which which those\nReforms of implementing statewide I but I think what we see it as surface levels we looked at this is the districts have not done as far as they can in some of those reforms and knowing that\nEven without going all the way that they're these benefits I think that could be an encouragement to districts to look at what powers they have under this legislation and maybe go even further into in rewarding effective teachers and in fact by the way you know getting some poor performing teachers out of the classroom which is also something that's easier after this legislation was passed\nAnd one of the reasons I I Want to I have I Want to talk about these topics just I think sometimes parents they only hear one side they don't hear the knowledge behind some of his decision making why ... did what a dinner to try to do what it did\nAnd I think we have to do a better job of communicate that an and are you guys that will uh will Flanders joining the research director I think ah you figured it out and I think for a lot of people it's just an understanding that there's there's some actual science here not just political rhetoric I think that's the value of the

series I think in our hearts parts we we knew that All right that they they weren't the best team in the national league and that they probably weren't going to win and it wasn't to sort of a disappointment when they did\nI think the issue here is different\nI don't think there's any team and the national league it's actually better than the brewers especially the way they're playing now and while we are reveling in this season I think legitimately\nThis the team that has the ability to win the world series for one for seven nine nine one six twenty ... mortgage talk and text line\nAll right what do you think is this a team that really can seriously go all the way common Greenfield ... first good afternoon\nI think I think you've got picked up there in the beginning of the earlier this year and that\nAnd everything else has been going I think\nFrom what\nI've been saying come on let's let's let's let's let me think\nWhat we can go and they don't\nWin at this time I'm there Tom thanks for calling from your lips to God's Ears for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that at the accident mortgage ... fine I mean I think you raised a couple of really interesting points first of all\nI mean you you look at the incredible depths of of this team I mean\nThere's there's really not a weak spot in the team okay maybe you say is like a catcher's that could hit a little bit better but beyond that I mean you know you talk about an outfield you talk about an infield is there any\nYou know group of starting players that you can put together that the team is perhaps better know\nYou can say okay well we'd like to have you know more of the great starting pitchers okay but All right even if I give you that even if they don't have the Clayton ... what the brewers have it is I think arguably the deepest and the best bullpen in major league baseball and I'll tell ya\nThere's not any there's not a team that wants to play the brewers if the brewers are head after five innings so\nIf you get starting pitching the can rise to the occasion to get past this\nAnd then you couple that with others I don't know a lot of potential here\nOr let's go to your Facebook Live page we are going to go all the way Mike says now that the cubs are out the brewers are clearly the team to beat their easily the best team left of the national league while we shouldn't get arrogant or complacent and they'll believe me I'm not arguing that\nI think we can be confident that they are going to go far yeah that's you know that's the point that's out there\nUm let's see Scott says I think they sweep Colorado and then um beat the I think the Colorado and then beat the Braves or Brad said we will win the pennant the world series we'll be tough but an eighty two they were the favorites lost\nThis year they probably the underdogs but anything is possible especially being hot like they are you know I I said this a lot but you my friend Wayne Larrivee of course the voice of the Green Bay Packers he\nAll he says and it's something that stuck with me but it's not necessarily who you play it's when you played them teams go through\nWhether it's a football team or basketball team or a baseball team there long seasons and teams go through different periods of time\nYou had the brewers before the all star break river when they lost five games in a row of Pittsburgh and they were reaching the end of this point where they play twenty three games of twenty three days and they were kind of out of gas well All right you you wanted to play the brewers then\nYou don't want to play the this brewers team now and you know so much of I think sports like so much of life is just believing that you can do something and I think\nI think this team believes that they can do it and it's it's this is incredible feeling that you get and again I don't cover the team on a daily basis but\nEvery once in a while I have an opportunity to talk to brewers management and you know once or twice a year you a chance to talk to a lot of the players and stuff and I I I think they genuinely liked each other I think they believe in themselves and that's a huge part of the battle Andy in Beloit Andy or there'll be T. M. J. good afternoon\nFor at least they really strongly just because\nIt was when we get which\nI thought they definitely it is not going to get something on the championship\nQuestion I don't want to go there\nWell I I think I mean I I'll tell you I mean starting in September I mean it it's been the last month or so as they've rounded into place you know when when they went on that run where they they won seven eight nine series in a row and with the exception of the the last two out of three to Pittsburgh one time\nIt was when they started doing that that I started to think that this team and the facts of this team is for real\nAnd let's give David Stern some credit I mean it's you know when when you went out and you pick up my stock is and um you you pick up ... Gonzalez and\nYou know the the players that he's acquired I'm Curtis Granderson have fit in incredibly well into the mix and\nI again and they're just starting to come together and I mean I think it's kind of been a ... a gradual thing I always thought that they had the talent to go far but now they're starting to you know deliver on that\nLet's talk to ... WTO O. J.\nTrial here right [noise] right question what do they\nKnow well the ... that that'll be an interesting thing what do they have to have to announce that today or is it I'm not sure if it's today or tomorrow morning or whatever that\nThey do they faring Fifteen and hope that I don't know yet man [laughter] yeah so\nI don't think it'll depend I think um my guess is they go for the first series which is the best the five in just a guess my guess is they go with three starting\nBest the five in just a guess my guess is they go with three starting pitchers so um it'll be ... shot scene and Wade Miley Jack Davis my guess is he's out for the first um series\nA I Would just say that I'm I'm trying to think I think will drift is probably in I think the ... panic is in\nAnd then it sort of the core group but there's there's a lot of guys good contributors were going to be on the outside looking in\nBut the fun part of this is what you just what a great team and what a lot of potential I understand by early next week we could all be singing the blues saying oh we just didn't see that coming and and you have to understand that that's what baseball is you know one team gets hot one team doesn't but I Will tell you\nFor those of us who have been long suffering Milwaukee Brewers fans\nI think now may very well be the time and I sit here in the studio and you you can't see it on Facebook Live camera they look up and we've got these these numbers up there and it's it starts at eleven ten nine eight goes down that eleven is the number of wins that the brewers would need to get to win the world series and\nAt first when I saw those numbers up there I thought okay maybe maybe this is an act of ... part of\nManagement but the more and more I think about it I think not I mean anything can happen but I tell you I think it is going to be an absolutely great ride and you can hear every pitch on WGM Jay starting tomorrow at four O. seven and a serious they mean if you're

then have that life completely up and did for the purpose of politics but but in general he's kind of stayed away from the free\nUntil yesterday yesterday he's at a campaign rally in in South even Mississippi\nAnd he can't help himself\nAnd he and he he starts to for the first time in really really pointed terms he starts to\nGo after the principal accuser of a Brett Kavanaugh out which would be Christine for here's the way the New York times reports that President Trump on Tuesday sharply mocked the woman who's allegation of sexual assault as up ended his effort to install a second justice on the Supreme Court\nAt a campaign rally Mr Trump went further than ever before indirectly sailing Christine Blasey Ford the university professor professor who has made various allegations against\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh playing to a crowd of thousands gathered to share him on the president pretended to be Dr Palese testifying before the Senate Judiciary committee last Thursday\nThirty six years ago this happened I had one beer right I had one beer said Mr Trump channeling his version of Dr Palese his ... voice of dripping with derision he didn't imitated her being questioned the hearing followed by her response is about what she could not recall about the alleged attack\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get here I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know what neighborhood was it in I don't know where's the house I don't know upstairs downstairs where was it I don't know Mr Trump said as the crowd applauded\nBut I had one beer that's the only thing I remember and then continue in his own voice he said\nIn a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife is shattered he then referring to people who've champion Dr\n... case he added they destroy people they want to destroy people these are really evil people\nAll right so again this is ... ... this is the first time that he has jumped into this debate with both feet\nAnd as you might predict\nThis decision to enter this discussion in this fashion\nHas generated a lot of controversy there are people saying oh this is classic Donald Trump this is Donald Trump you know showing no sympathy at all towards women other people are applauding him saying it's about time the president got in and started defending his nominee\nA lot of people are uncomfortable with what the president did yesterday our number for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that it's the academic mortgage talk and text line\nDid the president help or hurt\nThe case for or against judge Kavanaugh by deciding to wait in yesterday\nIn my opinion over the last well a couple of weeks he's he showed\nI think amazing restraint in resisting the urge to get drawn into it he has been supportive of judge Kavanaugh but at the same time he he hasn't gotten into on a he hasn't waded in directly on this matter that all changed yesterday\nDid he do the right thing for one for seven nine nine one six twenty and it's the accurate mortgage talking text line I'll tell you where I come down on this and we'll discuss in

for a long time I I came from a a divided household my my late wife\nWell she she was a liberal Democrat she was a liberal Democrat and I am what I Am a standing joke\nAt the polls when we used to to go to vote was that the the poll workers who who knew us both would always say depending on I I Would typically go in to vote first and the standing joke would be are the are here to get ... votes and\nAnd the truth is that that's probably pretty much what happened most of the time the the only time I think she might have voted for a Republican was when I was on the ballot as a true attorney general in Nineteen Ninety four and even then I'm not positive about that but\nBut we saw things differently when it came to politics but it did not stop us from being together for for a long period of time and and it's I Know that there's a lot of people who who just never understood that they get it how\nHow can you be married to somebody who's politics are different than yours and I was thinking about that because of the story in the front page of the journal sentinel about this couple\nDidn't live in Clinton Wisconsin and apparently there their front lawn is cordoned off in half\nAnd on one side of it there's Republican side Joe Scott Walker all that stuff on the other side of it is Democrat sides to leverage et cetera and divided the lawn and a half\nAnd she is a Democrat he is a a Republican\nAnd you know and it's an interesting story they stop off and they you know the the journals that report doesn't interviewing he's they say yeah this is kind of what happens you know when he's watching TV it's Fox News when she's watching TV at CNN they have been known to hide the remote San each other and things like that and I was thinking well\nI I can kind of I can kind of understand that\nBecause I I Lived it for for a long period of time\nBut I I always I Know with the same time\nThat there are people out there who just who do not understand that and and I would from time to time I would get emails from listeners and all because I I mean I made we made no secret about something we gotta joked about\nAnd they say well I just don't understand how how can how can you spend your life with somebody who has a world view that is so completely different than yours when it comes to politics and Europe political junkie and all those types of things\nAnd I used to just say well I don't necessarily analyze it it's just it's it is kind of what it is and and it's it's it how it's how it works and\nPeople disagree about stuff all the time and you can and I understand that maybe politics is more important than baseball but cubs fans I I'm sure it could be married to you know to um brewers fans maybe maybe even Packer fans can be married to bears fans

who on one side or another aren't necessarily reasonable and are just kind of just way off the bend on something and then I think the question becomes well\nI'm ... is there enough of another foundation do you have are your friends do you have enough other interest I mean if you're in I I Will tell you I mean that the James Carville Mary ... thing I never quite got that because it seemed to me that politics was their whole life and if that was it that then all you're doing it's fighting\nBut I think for most people\nYou know politics is a part of your life and those are the discussions and that's your world view but you're going to disagree on that stuff but there's going to be a lot of other things that you agree on my guess is that even in today's very very contentious

of the the White House strategic communications director that was sufficient first held by ... ... talking with Misha drop about the capital of point though that's coming up to forty of course President Trump we discuss this has left our program\nGetting a lot of attention ... up until yesterday he had been relatively relatively quiet on the whole Brett Kavanaugh situation I mean he he had obviously nominee Brett Kavanaugh he had supported a an FBI investigation he said that he didn't believe anything was going to come of it\nPlans and programs et cetera to get his money to his kids without again having to pay taxes or as much taxes possible on it\nNow this I guess somewhat contradicts forget somebody this contradicts that the story that Donald Trump tells about how he sort of a self made man and he started out with this\nMillion dollar loan that he repaid from his father in the New York times story says well it really wasn't wasn't that actually any loans he took world were a lot more but the Trump grew up I Know it's the son of this really rich builder and benefited a lot from that\nAnd then the story goes on to talk about how as his father got older how\nThey had the corporations and the father\nHad all these different plans if they developed to try to get money to the kids\nWith the smallest tax impact\nPossible right now the Trump Organization say that you know every year\nEvery year when they did this it was reviewed by the IRS it was reviewed by their lawyers and you know people signed off on this the New York times now goes back and says well you look at this and you look at that and you look at this and this this looks a little bit fishy and maybe they shouldn't have been able to do this and they should have paid more taxes on this but you know they're they're going back\nYou know they're going back decades on this and the idea being that I guess number one if President Trump says he was self made guy yeah he's probably not telling the truth he got\nHe got a head start that most people don't necessarily get namely that he you know he was was born into the family that had this incredible well it goes on to say that some of the business deals he made work necessarily that good and that you know he was was hurting at the time of\nYou know the the real estate crash back in in the eighties and the debt kind of bailed him out by doing stuff\nAnd then it also says yeah they took advantage of all the different tracks strategies and they kind of pushed the line for transferring money from debt with various family members All right so that's\nThat is a summary I I think of the you know forty page story\nAnd of course it's getting all this attention the New York times as an editorial Donald Trump and the self made sham he's he's not really a he's not really a self made man you know he inherited a lot of this money or for their part the Trump Sawyer warns the New York times\nOf that you know some of the stuff that is the family story I I Want to talk about the the larger issue here I understand\nThat President Trump is incredibly divisive\nI understand that there's almost no middle ground there that you either\nLove Donald Trump or you hate Donald Trump I get all that but I mean I really I read the story kind of looking for the smoking gun and what you have to get his his father died decades ago and what you have is a rich guy who\nPassed on his money to his kids Donald Trump President Trump was like the favored one of the kids\nBut you know essentially from the moment these kids were born they developed like these tax strategies to pass money on to the kids with the least tax impact possible and yes it it's not it doesn't appear that Donald Trump is a self made man in the sense of\nI don't know Horatio Alger or somebody like that\nBut I guess I'm reading all this and I'm trying to figure out you know what what the new ground is here and whether anybody cares I mean I don't know about you\nBut it doesn't come as a surprise to me that I Know President Trump was born into a wealthy family and was able to I don't know bootstrap off of a lot of the buildings and a lot of the work that his father did and his father\nBuildings and a lot of the work that his father did and his father was a billionaire who passed that money along to his kids I guess I'm not surprised by any of that\nFor one for seven nine nine when six twenty this he acted mortgage talking text line\n... does any of this matter really one way or another to know Donald Trump is the president in in twenty Eighteen and I know the New York times is patting yourself on the back we've got this huge expos they get I I look at it and say I I don't see how this changes anybody's\nMind I mean I I understand the president\nHis narrative is hey I'm just kind of self made guy I'm not sure that there is anybody out there whoever necessarily bought into this you know the president's story is well I got a million dollar loan that I repaid\nWell if you believe the New York times that the the loan he it was a lot more than a million dollars but does anybody care I mean I\nI guess I always I assumed that the president was born into a really

very glad to have you with us we are joined right now by Mercedes slap she is the White House strategic communications director good afternoon\nOr good afternoon how are you I Am well thank you slit let's talk a little bit of a judge Kavanaugh when when President Trump nominated judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court did did anybody anticipate anything like what's happened over the last couple of weeks\nI'm not sure if we had to pay to the extent of what we've seen that show that the Democrats have a present\nAnd and all of this um I have to tell you I mean from day one the Democrats made it very clear that they were going to do everything they could carry the cabinet nomination and with that being said they've taken\nA low to a new low because of the fact that what they had done that his family in terms of the character assassination\nFamily in terms of the character assassination in terms of\nBasically dragging his name through the mud is just unforgivable and also for Dr Ford who was expecting basically for her own um what she\nHad expressed to be confidential and the fact is is that the Democrats lead to this information out and she's being represented by Democrats political operative lawyers so it it's all very disturbing as to how the Democrats have failed\nIn this process it's been a disgrace to watch how they held onto this information for months where you could have had a confidential FBI investigation and said wait till the last minute\nTo present this allegation to then call for an FBI investigation and basically put\nJudge Kavanaugh's life on hold and this process on hold a for political purposes\nUm President Trump's nominee judge Kavanaugh was\nReally to bleed relatively circumspect what was going on he was all you need for the investigation indicating that you know there was ... but he used to be on your show\nYesterday at a rally in Mississippi we did we lose the which some comments about the accuser\nWas then in ... who was written speaking on the\nBook the president was simply stating facts that a lot of media outlets have not reported on um there are inconsistencies in Dr Ford's\nTestimony um you know while she was sincere and her and her\nIn her testimony in our hearing and obviously I mean I you know if she has gone through a sexual assault situation as it were all very sympathetic toward that with that being said you look at what these special prosecutor who went and a miss Michel ...\nWho asked the questioning a to both Kavanaugh as well to Dr Ford and what she represented and again she comes from a very neutral ground basically saying that there is just not enough evidence in this situation and and watch and what Dr Ford presented\nThat there's basically a lot of inconsistencies in her story where she doesn't know\nWhat had happened what had happened and where it happened who took her home that day and and even those witnesses\nThat Dr Ford had mentioned basically refuted her claim so it is a situation where the emotional um basis of all of this is driving facts\nAnd that is very very problematic because we want to get to the facts obviously we of course feel for those who have gone through sexual\nAssault I'm ... ... women who have gone through sexual assault mad as well but\nWe also at this case what's happening is we've got to separate that from the fact that there are facts in this story and that is part of what the FBI is doing to\nTo basically um you know get the information that they need the background information that they need a so we're going to get through this process but with that being said what has been horrific is saying how this has all played out\nIt it it's become a circus it's really trying to destroy people's lives I Know Brett Kavanaugh personally I Know his wife has children I worked with Brett Kavanaugh on the Bush administration we work very closely together he was always incredibly professional\nRespectful to women to all and and really I Do Brett Kavanaugh we all know and love is someone who is has had a stellar career not only in the executive branch but also the judicial branch where he's respected by legal\nExperts on both sides and it's just so unfortunate that we've ended up\nThrowing away his seller career to focus on high school and yearbooks and all this craziness that we're saying\nWe're synch last was held strategic communications director senator Cory Booker today and he says well the White House should ditch the cabinet nominations wizard innocent or guilty and I guess maybe that is the course of bleach does that have any appeals to the White House\nAbsolutely not I mean we look at judge Kavanaugh's record it and he has said he's going to be an independent judge a he has a very strong judicial record I mean over three hundred opinions are written\nA he's obviously served in the district ... circuit court of appeals which is the second highest court in the land he's gone through six FBI investigations demand is more than beyond qualified there is no question\nIn my mind about that what the Democrats are doing is that if they obviously want to delay stall resist a destroy a as much as they can because they're\nThey're trying to bet on on the on an election I mean they are very concerned of who take this to to\nThe Supreme Court position right so for ... for them this is an all or nothing approach and they're all approach is an an ambush at a character assassination attempt to basically try to take down\nWhoever President Trump would affect whether it would have been Kavanaugh or not but I find this to be\nThe lowest I look I've been in Washington a for Twenty years and I've never in my lifetime seen uh\nIs this a time to buy one party to absolutely destroy\nThese a judge I just I've never seen anything like that I mean you can take it back to the Clarence Thomas but I mean the the reality is is that they the Democrats are in a ...\nAll or nothing campaign where they will smear they will ambushed they will destroy whoever is going to try to become the next Supreme Court justice and it happens to be brought cap\nAnd that kind of ties into what my next question was going to be I used to look at it you think already this happens to judge who in their right mind you reach out to say here I I Want you to be the next Supreme Court knowing that you're going to get treatment as well but\nYou're going to have stuff that you did in high school and grade school or whatever you\nKnow plastered and turned into a drunk or you're a sexual predator or whatever\nI'm

[noise]\nNineteen Jeff record several of the ... day or I could lay off sorry for Fox tomorrow afternoon for the\nQuestion is unlike in two thousand eight\nAnd two thousand eleven where I thought you know ... us those of us who are brewers fan you wanted to see him go all the way you wanted to see in the world series go to the world series I think in our hearts of hearts we we knew that All right that they they weren't the best team in the national league and that they probably weren't going to win and it wasn't just sort of a disappointment\nWhen they did I think the issue here is different I don't think there's any team and the national league it's actually better than the brewers especially the way they're playing now and while we are reveling in this season I think legitimately\nThis the team that has the ability to win the world series for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nShe accurate mortgage talk and text line right what do you think is this a team that really can seriously go all the way Tom and Greenfield time your first good afternoon [laughter]\n[laughter]\nHey let me give me a number and everything like that [laughter] and I think\nFrom [laughter] come on [laughter] but\nMaybe it maybe\nWhen I'm there Tom thanks for calling from your lips to God's Ears for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that at the accident mortgage talking touched fine I mean I think you raised a couple of really interesting points first of all\nI mean you you look at the incredible ... of of this team I mean\nThere's there's really not a weak spot in the team okay maybe you say is like a capture that could hit a little bit better but but beyond that I mean you know you talk about an outfield you talk about an infield is there any\nYou know group of starting players that you can put together that the team is perhaps better know you can say okay well we'd like to have you know more of the the great starting pitchers okay but All right I even if I give you that even if they don't have the ... what's the brewers have it is I think arguably the deepest and the best bullpen\nIn major league baseball and I'll tell ya there's not any kind of team that wants to play the brewers if the brewers are head after five innings so\nIf you get starting pitching the can rise to the occasion and get past this and then you couple that with others I don't know a lot of potential here or let's go to let's see our Facebook Live page we are going to go all the way Mike says now that the cubs are out the brewers are clearly the team to beat\nTheir easily the best team left or the national league while we shouldn't get arrogant or complacent and they'll believe me I'm not arguing that I think we can be confident that they are going to go far\nYeah that's yeah that's the point that's out there um let's see Scott says I think they sweep Colorado and then um beat the I think the ... Colorado and then beat the Braves or Brad says we will win the pennant the world series we'll be tough\nBut in any to they were the favorites and loss this year they probably the underdogs but anything is possible especially\nBeing hot like they are you know I I say this alive but my friend Wayne Larrivee of course the voice of the Green Bay Packers he\nAll he says and it's something that's stuck with me but it's not necessarily who you play it's when you play them teams go through whether it's a football team or basketball team or a baseball team there long seasons\nAnd teams go through different periods of time\nYou had the brewers before the all star break river when they lost five games in a row in Pittsburgh and they were reaching the end of this point where they play twenty three games and twenty three days and they were kind of out of gas well All right you you wanted to play the brewers that you don't want to play the this brewers team now and\nThere's so much of I think sports like so much of life is just believing that you can do something and I think\nI think this team believes that they can do it and it's it's this is incredible feeling that you get ... and again I don't cover the team\nOver the team on a daily basis but every once in a while I have an opportunity to talk to brewers management then you know once or twice a year you a chance to talk to a lot of the players and stuff and I I I think they genuinely like each other I think they believe in themselves and that's a huge part of the battle Andy in Beloit Andy or there'll be T.

J. good afternoon\n[laughter] [laughter] really strongly just because\nWe get one\n[laughter] another five or something [laughter]\nI don't know why not go there [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think I mean I I'll tell you I mean starting in September I mean it's it's been the last month or so as they've rounded into place you know when when they went on that run where they\nThey won seven eight nine series in a row with the exception of the last two out of three to Pittsburgh one time\nIt was when they started doing that that I started saying hey that this team now thanks a thought that this team is for real and let's give David Stern some credit I mean it's you know when when you went out and you pick up Mike was stock is and um you you pick up ...\n... you know the the players that he's acquired I'm Curtis Granderson have have fit in incredibly well into the mix and\nI again and they're just starting to come together and I mean I think it's kind of been a ... a gradual thing I always thought that they had the talent to go far but now they're they're starting to you know so liver on that\nLet's talk the policy Herbert polio WTO O. J. [laughter]\nWell I think here right right right here right\nNow while the ... that that will be an interesting thing what do they have to have to announce that today or is it I'm not sure if it's ... morning or whatever that\nBefore they are they carrying Fifteen at all but I don't know yet [laughter] yeah maybe somebody else\nAnd I think it'll depend I think um my guess is they go for the first series which is the best the five and just the gas my guess is they go with free starting pitcher so um it'll be Gonzalez shot scene and wait Miley Jack Davis my guess is he's out for the first um series\nOr I Would just say that I'm I'm trying to think I think would risk is probably in\nI think the lingo Santana is in and then it's sort of the core group but there's there's a lot of guys good contributors were going to be on the outside looking in but the fun part of this is you know what you just want a great team and what a lot of potential I understand by early next week\nWe could all be singing the blues saying oh we just didn't see that coming in and you have to understand that that's what baseball issue you know one team gets hot one team doesn't but I Will tell you\nFor those of us who have been a long suffering Milwaukee Brewers fans\nI think now may very well be the time and I sit here in the studio and you can't see her Facebook Live camera they look up and we've got these these numbers up there and it's it starts at eleven ten nine eight goes down ... eleven is the number of wins that the brewers would need to get a to win the world series and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "03"}
