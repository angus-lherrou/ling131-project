hug which you granted when you were at a fund raiser\nFor our now lieutenant governor Dan Forrest\nI I I Do recall it because it's very rare to somebody wants to make usually that want to slight may have to make sure I understood correctly [laughter] it's a delight to talk to you\nAgain well we had our picture made together and I was just like a child I was just so thrilled because I have so much\nA respect for you and I'm just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show like doing so well and your daughter is doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her uh I tell people that Donald Trump is not my first choice for president because I was my first choice as a buddy was my second choice and I also say with the least we got to be on the White House just wasn't the one I thought would end up being there\nYou know it's gotta be tough but as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it uh\nAnd your little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you why because I Know are well enough to know how ... years ... some guy like Jim Acosta ... will try it you know put the squeeze on her\nI'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him I realized he's about to get his head handed to him it was just I don't know it yet and sure enough she turns and really takes an down a notch and I I watch are the guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach it she makes to her ... year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] All right I Love so much is the fact that you have supported President Trump and ... it to everybody eats it wouldn't try to do that you know he had a president\nThat is true as a fact a lot of people do new ignore appreciate your call Charlotte let's go to a Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you were when they are you\nTalking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true 'cause I have five girls\nAnd every one of them can take now just about anybody of fighting in something they believe that it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician or concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that is about dead and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where cabinet are facing opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and or a ... a row the weight which was a ridiculous decision that was a reaching out into thin air and creating\nLaw that did not have any racist and the constitution\nWhat most people don't understand even grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states\nAnd each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question is to deal with it true the issue of person heard\nBecause we would accept the biological fact this is your the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of air a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because there should be about protect in venison people not just about stopping abortion\nGo back to ten seconds he reminds me when I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger than Trump and and we've never had a president named Mike um what do you think [laughter]\nA gym I I can tell you that there's a greater likelihood that I Will have transgender surgery ever run for any public office again\nFair enough well you can catch the man in his new element that is of course there's great TV show it's Huckabee on TBN and the new season premieres this Saturday aid eastern seven central and stay on the line Mike I'm jumbo hadn't\nWhen you just need to be heard when you just need a way to day is an extraordinary day from Wisconsin Gina ... from ... year with news it will blow your mind\nYou know I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot Lacey Trump same everywhere it doesn't say Donald Trump but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person of whereas Republicans\nI think look at the ... and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh and so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm all for show I think all\nTrump has basically said this is a referendum on a hand that that as a nationalized election not good for a Republican or any time in the power and the party in power and so they're trying to like a local election\nUh and not have a problem if the main issue\nAnd they want on chronic caught a judicial appointments or do they want that to me talk at because uh Charles approval rating still not great it's a and the\nOwner you know the low forties if you look at a solid gold and then the thirties\nAs you look at other ... since I'm a he's seen as very polarizing figure and he seems to stoke the culture wars in a way that is not helpful for the Republican Party or the country a mocking the accuser of his ago saying I don't know I don't know\nAre not great for a national thing because ah you\nWell who all holding called them all all qualities\nNow you know and after the victim\nWhen when I when I heard that I remember thinking at the time you know everything he just said\nFactually is absolutely one hundred percent true\nThat in fact in terms of someone who was a a bringing accusations against others that she was she was pretty vacuous at times and I I agree with that completely the same time I grin and what he said I also grown because I think this is exactly how it's going to be taken he is again\nHanding ammunition to his opponents and he just doesn't need to do that if he had merely recited the areas in which your testimony was rather deficient on specifics instead of the marketing but\nHe just couldn't resist himself I suppose\nAnyway let's take a

Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film\nOr is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John uh blindly\nUm but they basically enlisted volunteers and have them conduct searches on both Google and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was all five six month\nPeriod and then they captured all the search results that people got out some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status\nAnd what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seemed to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis results favored Hillary Clinton\nOr they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut here's real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that one day sort sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\nWhen you just need to be her and when you just need a way\nNo your ear you're exactly right um and if you think about all the sort of dystopian knowledge or a novels about a totalitarian us and it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state\nWas going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of bumpy information to us but it was visible that's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face and what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nAbout what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the test\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a\n... imagine I'm Mao or stolen or a Mussolini that had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we've given them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah last us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nAllow cameras and I'll make quite come at a lot of it is believed that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these\nPeople but what I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests for what he's doing and about search engines\nAnd they're used to be I click which had a they they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of ... that was if he didn't want to use the result he wanted to resolve\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppress if they make them the pets I click or what happened to it and I is that that that\nI Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has the search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and do go was actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they want the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results\nThey actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being present item that is that is going to change your ... biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago\nDr though is good it's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness\nOut there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the place that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they all prepared to use that information against you\nTo me to steal your manipulate you in a way Marshall gain or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that they\nWhich is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great liable to Google essential in twenty six teams struck a crucial ugliness a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is\nBut um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe that there is some kind of a wage with where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of the trails there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment what a day for tennis you ready to play a is ever going to write this site is pressure a liquor dean knows that allergy congestion can

S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we both countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products to sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but\nThey say we don't want to do something else yeah we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada\nAll right to a call from Sharon in crane Missouri a good evening Sharon\n... and ... ... as a kid I think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they are going to be paying tariffs\nOn it and specified items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are I care and second\nA fad trade agreement that we had had\n... I'm Sorry I I just I too jaded anymore I Do not believe it's added some ... notion of what we've got to help everybody else\nThere is one law that goes above all of their lives when it comes to politics the tower and that followed them money and\nIf you follow it and what that is put on our politician by the audience by different governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we have had\nBy our own government if you follow that might you will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break here I'll let the doctor gave is linked here I'm sure more learned opinion after the break as you are and I will add a couple of things here\nUh to what you just said and please stay on the line one would be of course that no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimate him the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are I'm jumbo Hannon and we'll be back in just a moment\nWhen you just need to be heard when you just need a voice breaking news weather and traffic in the morning on your way to organize\nAll right let legendary libertarian the argument a little bit further here it costs about nine million dollars to make him one a one\nAbrams tank I'm sure the Chinese could make if we're far less than that so why don't we outsource our entire capability of making battle tax to the Chinese and while rabbit we could also outsourced you have thirty five fighter in our modern ships in the like\nAnd that we would just make out like bandits except for the fact that of course we will become the third rate world power\nYeah except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can buy to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost them for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce the cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point and I ... I I don't think I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you you said that ... we\nWe shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese have extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back we'll talk more about uh some of the the Chinese the applications that possibly

badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes I Do a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's go to David new calls in from San Francisco divide the David good evening\n[laughter] yes I Do in your guest Amy I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just have all the shore to five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right right yeah and in\nFact if you remember just the dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in cost and six billion in finance so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken bridge\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nThere are ... are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was said okay well I didn't know that yeah and what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and this crush war today right okay\nYeah ... was the Republican governor and Willie Brown was the former mayor the two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each part had happened inspector massive march ... almost to the to the man they refused to accept delivery unload part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nWell that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh a curve in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below Kurt\nHigh you know the thing that bothers me about the uh the steel who from China is if you drive a car a lot\nAnd you have to have your brakes re done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor anymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor they it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away\nThe days everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper but the quality is also cheap\nOr All right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom at Wal Mart you really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or something like ... well I mean that indicates will break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe it will die\nOr is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of quality you see do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue of products like steel obviously quality is a central there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a injuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer product look at the textile in industry\nSo if the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty

ten people\nAnd found no just just came out late last night no cooperation of the allegations made by a two of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is according to an executive summary\nUh released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report\nThe request was torn investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states of the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation so there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witness is with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from\nA the Ramirez lawyers said well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to ... all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against Kavanaugh\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had an elder down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge will entice her PJ a Smith\nA Timothy God debt and Christopher Garrett the FBI investigators also spoke with\nA another attorney for one of the witnesses mark judge a close friend of Kavanaugh's\nAll was allegedly in the room when Ford was assaulted in Port said it was judge jumping on her and Kevin ... love her to get away my clothing Garret who would tend to Georgetown Prep with judging tapping on and their names appeared in the Nineteen eighty two calendar Kavanaugh discussed in his Senate Judiciary committee testimony\nFBI personnel also interviewed Deborah Ramirez who accused Kavanaugh\nOf a boom putting private parts in her face and forcing her to touch it as she shopped him away while the two were undergraduates at Yale University relating to her marriage does allegation investigators interviewed to of some to suppose a dive witnesses and a close college friend ... as\nA third suppose that I witnessed refuse to speak to investigators participation in FBI background check interviews is voluntary the supplemental background investigation was ordered by uh the White House at the request a of the uh a committee\nOr forty six page report is what it was and uh as we now know none of those witnesses that supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses that that potentially had first hand knowledge mhm and you\nKnow cooperation to get yeah right and and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all of a long delayed delayed delight with the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president would draw the nomination\nAnd that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got the the greater\nOr I guess the stronger a foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delays is nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can appeal\nTo either one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody\nThat will help you delayed even further and that's over it is over I don't know what the vote\nBut it's going to happen center games from South Dakota

I don't I don't get right out of it and it's like well yeah that that was a surprise for different suggest you yeah yeah yeah um [laughter] nobody you let's not get political by bringing ESPN it right I just I mean on it got huge news no it\nWas and and the endorsement list really I mean it came out and made his rounds but it really didn't go any further from that there hasn't been that presence\nYou know by Obama and that might be his choice I mean they've been saying what they hanging out I did see the stories here's what he's reading this summer nobody cares\nNo one cares I remember that story no one here's what's on his reading list shows them you know on a on a couch you know somewhere probably in Martha's Vineyard no\nBody cares but it hasn't been the political impact\nAnd in that part is I mean for the right it's kind of been that way for a while George W.

welcome snow dirty words that he's not from Martha's Vineyard I actually asked this question in my mind\nUh because a friend a well I actually someone in the house was watching\nSomething where there was um there was this area and it was clear in this area it was all liberals they were it was part of reality t._v. show but they're based on the things that people were saying and show it was clearly a liberal and I kinda thought thought of Martha's Vineyard because it kind of had that appeal looked like that right\nAnd that's thought to myself\nThere isn't a conservative place like that [laughter] and there really isn't [laughter]\nI mean because I don't know I mean you don't I well we don't look for safe spaces [laughter]\nNumber on it by water is I Would say you really have to make

type of unity\nIn the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I I didn't think that you would see the unity in the Republican Party this soon and it's solid right

I Hope I got a cute I read your\nTrial at fault and it's like [noise]\n... questions we ... we should not move on to another candidate\nThat was senator Spartacus in New Jersey [laughter]\nHuh Tucker Carlson that was the senators pardon yeah well I don't I just don't I was I was doing the ... over Cory Booker what\nOh that's where he said it doesn't matter whether he's innocent or not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out now [laughter] so if you just raise just throw up the allegation yeah and and there's what slightly ... words later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it goes where we've been through this already McCarthy\n... you're not a Congress right\nExactly that's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about is not what they endorse exactly for on the tracks here's your forecast\nAnd unusually persistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies rain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers high Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nA hundred years defending the process of exactly what they're saying so you were a liberal you have lived her life in a liberal world Martha's Vineyard Keno liberals to ever say look I don't agree with having a hate crime but I agree with that process is worth preserving other liberals who feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter and asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who have been appointed by liberal president who had been accused and it would act and similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like to know is just dead wrong this is all about partisanship [laughter] the opposite was happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up Canada Day everybody would behaving the opposite way and so his partisanship\nAnd I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like paying great\nYeah\nI ... and ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process\nYou know if it's\nTelling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened you're likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all this chaos\nBefore\nThe actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation\nAnd withdraw his own confirmation and or the president will do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but as president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this in place\nWell you know when you when you hear Dershowitz a talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they'd say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you commented on the temperament for the job so you're out your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind\nAnd I think the important thing is and it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know antifa anti cause we call it there's supposed to be anti fascist yet what did they promote what is our actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism and so you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here\nWhat you see here from the Democrats a mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe me if she used her that the the\nThe defendant has no rights at all the defendant is\nAutomatically guilty that is the mindset of a fashion that that's not the mindset\nOf somebody who believes in the American constitution in the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fashion\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we'd back it up with the ...\nNot just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist no wonder is exact words and what does he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they've moved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand that I think that this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump\nAnd enough people hated Trump where it stuck for a while and then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus\nAnd allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who we really really like\nThis is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics\nUsed against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realized oh no that can hit him than it can hit him oh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn\nWith the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people\nYou know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day and said and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late\nIt's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance\nAnd it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times\nYes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fashion and the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condense from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought\nThey're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk\nWe can send you to jail in New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of this\n\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours\nThat somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business\nYou wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou think like us you behave like us you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and uniting realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become an it's not the fringe this is the important thing a bit of this is not the fringe this is the main stream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's a mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party\nAnd you have uh\nThis is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and\nGet in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah\nRight because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been crossed I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough yeah\nAnd that more people will start rejecting the the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party yeah\nAs we're always say tell us where we're wrong you can't eight six six Ninety red eye\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been

I think we've we've done this long enough in here you know conversations have you have with with staff players and so forth anything that can be a correction nature America that that's really internally and you know so that combine position that's going to change I think you're always recognize individual frustration\nBut McCarthy at it that it was possible that Rogers may have overreacted\nYou know we read of all we do some motive things are passing getting wasn't quite where we'd like to prevent because while you have the video and then we go back through things all on Monday so I've always been proved in the run game for the protection was better but you know we do we just had some some functional mistakes that uh we're just going to continue to work it\nBut it is true however that every close relationship no matter the nature personal professional work combination of the two is going to get strained from time to time\nMap you wash dishes proper relationships with all with all my players so period I have gone through a lawyer's together so that really should\nAsk for speculation that Rogers is out of the loop when it comes to calling the place\nAt the end of the day the way we function of pope together a game plan is is very similar to that I think like anything here our philosophy will never change as as long as I'm stirring up there and it's what officers don't make it a Corvette successor so\nThere is given a lot of responsibility and rightfully so his ... that you're at the line of scrimmage during the preparation process so I Know that that will continue just as it was paying for quite some time for\nOne thing that Mike mccarthy is always held his hallmark is team first and everyone being on the same page so is he disappointed in Aaron Rodgers tone after the game\nAll they're doing the tone and things like that so very passionate man that I'm very passionate very competitive pay among all different types of the cold a lot of games mostly gone through a lot of gay and plants and you know you're still represented pain was the head coach but still I close my door last night and then watch the game I felt like we love blood out there\nBut should is quarterbacking team leader come to him first before airing it out in his post game press her\nTalking on a daily basis so you know whether your opinion of how things are communicating it'd be you know anything that structure you know your your opinion is is hurting respected but at the end of the day off for a very very good and very powerful the ball or operation author get some important to to always you know move forward\nPublic cat or as hum you also looking Aaron Rodgers earlier in training camp got on some of the young wide receivers as well I Believe the the phraseology that he used was that I quoted piss poor and the clothes I used to I mean\nWe all thought\nThat was a little bit strange as well and I wonder I'm not going to ask you to play armchair psychologist but maybe I Am does he feel in your opinion may be that he's going to be thirty five and a couple of months that window is starting to close as much as he may want to fight against it as much as he may want to say no I'm Still healthy I Want to play until I'm forty\nHe's got to understand that this is what your Thirteen fourteen others in the NFL guys usually don't last that long\nLeadership takes different forms and you've seen others be strong in silent and lead by example or maybe they lead behind closed doors where they put an arm or on to a younger player that's not cutting it and saying you're you're missing this you're not working hard enough\nAaron seems to be this year to be whatever's on his mind it's up there um some things obviously he won't talk about you talk to them every week in the locker room you get to ask them questions and you know what he will\nAdhere to and what he will address and other things at stake compartmentalized but yeah it seems like there's just a I don't know if it's an added sense of urgency or maybe just it's as simple as an added sense of openness where he's more comfortable calling people out including his head coach including a wide receiver that's running right roads\nAnd he's also knows that he's got his boss already taken care of in Canton and maybe a statue somewhere in Green Bay street to contract and yes the biggest fat is contracting the NFL how fortunate you think the Packers were to get the bears when they did because that's the team that right now it's like a jelly\nIt's strange to well I guess not because the Chicago media and their fans are such when sex but I mean there are already christening tribute shift in last week's performances upper enjoys quarterback now why she goes up this Sunday service for ... and they're going to want him treated the Cleveland\nThat's just how they rule but no you're right it wait Larry always says this in a place that just to be able to fill that all the sports that who you play it's when you play him\nYet there was a good time to play the Chicago Bears they played very well that night they just didn't know what to do with a lead\nA they're going to be a much better team than extend the Packers play them at all things are equal in the rosters of the same and you don't have any devastating injuries yeah that was a very fortunate circumstance where the Packers and hopefully it will be that way this Sunday today against the Detroit Lions this is a team you want to get right now is it\nAnd we talked about the injuries just a couple of minutes ago with a wide receivers me last week rental car was out and you mentioned the concussion protocol the drawing I'm Alice in his bed and so does that mean the guy's like Mark ... Valdez gambling acrimonious St brown I Love these names and they all have to start getting their big boy pants on\nThat's just it it it seems like injuries happening in the deepest part of your roster and it would you look at the Packers Russia boy they got some good talent at white out but\nThese kids are going to be pressed early to kids that's very young they don't they don't know they just don't know they want to please but it's the NFL and it's only gonna get harder as these weeks go by because you're trying to find your personality you're trying to find out who you are in now that personality is going to be determined\nBy you're wanting to but you're three or four or five\nLast couple of minutes with gene Miller a host of Wisconsin's morning news on WGM Jay\nGoing around the NFL I think a couple of teams really stand out maybe a couple of young quarterbacks\nSend out you look at what Jared golf in the Los Angeles rams are doing the only other on beaten team Patrick homes in the Kansas City chiefs one in the ...

Allison the Packers rookie wide receivers James Bond more mark was founded in ... and many same brown will be called upon to perform so what is Patricia scene from the rookie wide receivers\nI think they've done a really good job of the class on both sides of all you know in skilled position you know the I'm from the defense of perspective how with those guys and wide receivers specifically answering your question I'm big tall long guys that can a person but vertical I'm really kind of do a great job of stress in the defense um a lot of that really for him with a quarterback\nUm with Roger ... some of it's going to be just little nuances and routes where he's going to see leverage you can see a coverage you're going to see some specific and you're going to change or something just kind of real quick and and give it to a to those experienced receivers that he has in there um you know he's able to kind of get on the same page with those guys pretty quick\nThirteen nearly as much as I Know he doesn't I mean it's sometimes it was ... veiled and other times it was you know very clearly directed at someone um he's getting a little older and he's got his money secured so maybe he feels like you can take direct shots but\nLook they hang out with somebody for Thirteen Years like Roger ... McCarthy of done and you're going to have creative differences I I don't think it's a matter of them not liking each other I've never found that to be the case\nIn fact I think a lot of their frustration over the years us more directed towards ... and then one another [noise] uh what I think they ought to position here where they need to figure out what does all kinds of capability really is I still think the often says to predicated on\nIndividuals winning one on one battles and got a great quarterback you've got some guys who can win those one on one battles but there's not as much scheming to get guys open\nAs you see what other teams that I think back to that bears game first half I bought matinees office was interesting it was Chris\nIts threats all different points of the field in the flat the second level deep balls it everything to it ah the Packers offices you got to be your guy and I'll tell you what the football that's not a great way to play football and I think that leads to some of the office of clunky and is that we've seen you know the one touched on that I noted last week\nThat was a scheme that got the player Oprah was immigrants touchstone but don't easy that was and it was drawn into Allison getting underway enforcing the defensive backs they have to make a decision\nThey chose Rhonda didn't change coverage and it was a touchdown so you'd like to see a little bit more of that and I think that's maybe what Aaron Rodgers is alluding\nTo and then you've got the injuries to the wide receiving corps right now Randall have had in his last week because the hamstring injury don't know how long that's going to hammer him if not sideline and outright drawing I'm Alison\nIn the NFL's concussion protocol now you've got all these rookie wide receivers that even that's the timing and invested draft picks and but now it's I guess big football time to strap on and let's go for real it as like market and Mike was valid and scaling back lamenting St brown and the like\nYeah and I am curious to see what they're snap tone is and how many of those guys are active\nThe other guy who could factor into the passing of his time Montgomery is given as opportunities that he's had as a rookie or as a wide receiver you've gotta earn Jones healthy now and it really the most dynamic back of the three ... Williams is is doing fine\nAh but you may not need Montgomery is much might find that he's he's better suited as a receiver until the point where the the wide receiver corps back to a hundred percent\nAs far as the defense is concerned Kevin king said during the week that he's ready to go how much do you think they've missed him back there in the defense of second\nThere yeah I just it it never really been able to get into a flow with him on the field for too long it's always been something to shoulder the growing or something\nBut I think they're most talented covered quarter um so I think he factors heavily into what they want to do or they want to leave guys in ice so and maybe rotate coverages in a different direction I feel like they can trust Kevin king to be kind of a shutdown sort a guy in time now whether is they're not an hour or not I think remains to be seen but he needs time on the field\nUh besides really could factor into today's game as a to somebody's came as well so\nThat's another opportunity the Packers evidence sort of veteran on this defense and divine houses done I think for the season I don't think to bring him back so I'm working through some back and this has to be sure but\nYou got to get a pass Russia I mean if you don't have a password doesn't matter how healthy the guys are in the back end their job become so much more difficult now know Mohammed workers and\nThey got a tremendous rush last week on Josh Allen but\nMatthew staffers out a rookie yeah I don't think you'll make some of the same mistake that island and speaking of the lines were they expect out of them today\nI expected it Chris often so I really do this this team looks so much different than it did and weak one\nIn a terrible blow of laws that hold against the jets and it's a totally different team\nOr for whatever reason I'm not really sure why but uh the run a game is on point they've now got to carry ons onto the rookie who's getting the bulk of the steps\nAre finally had a guy go over a hundred yards in Johnson theoretically always given the Packers problems out of the backfield as a receiver\nA kind of a niche got really good at it and look at the stats Marvin zones has absolutely crushed the Packers over the last couple of years for whatever reason they have a problem with more of an Jones and Matthew Stafford has been among the best quarterback and all of football the last few weeks\n... go look I mean it's quarterback ratings over a hundred\nUm he's played good clean Chris football just hasn't\nResulted in the amount of wins I'm sure they prefer\nFinally coming up uh after today's Packers game on a package of TGIF outgoing you'll be in for you because you are in Denver covering the brewers are and they are playoff run in the national individuals are yeah still\nAt Packard bar from uh Denver right across the corps field washing the Packers game and then uh the brewers game I'll head over to the field as well and uh get the best I can hopefully a lot of brewers fans but I spent the Packers bar right across from Coors Field they have a nice mix Pakistan's brewers fan there should be a good atmosphere\nShould be great listen for you on a six twenty WGM Jay want a three point three F.

I Would say definitely got the job done there\nAnd the name that we didn't really hear a lot of ... and now he's banked up going into the game but only twenty four yards on the ground on five Carrie Christian ivory Fifteen yards on six carry run defense did a phenomenal job didn't really hear McCoys name much didn't hear I read named much in basically buffalo became a one dimensional team\nPackers would love to pass rush and in the secondary able to take advantage of that so yes it's a rookie quarterback totally different tests do they obviously with Matthew Stafford but uh uh tested the Packers defense I Would say um they were very much up to it that's a good thing and we'll see if they can build off of\nA note on Mason Crosby who missed an extra point last Sunday but drilled three field goals from fifty two thirty six and fifty two yards and that's the first time that two field goals of fifty plus yards had been made by kicker ever at ... field in and mark\nI Know that everybody blinks I Want to miss is that extra point as you should but to make two fifty two yard field goals in the same game is significant\nIt is I I think if oh everybody always talks about the a quarterback play for Green Bay in the last twenty five years\nPicking is very important gets under looked a lot but Mason Crosby Ryan long when you start piling the last Twenty years of kicking is well Mason has with the exception of two thousand twelve\nHe has been so consistent I think he keeps getting better and better and I I just think we've taken for granted and we've seen that with uh in the playoffs and then obviously last week\nAnytime you do something for the first time at ... field that's a that's a big\nDeal [noise] Packers are eight and four in Detroit under Mike mccarthy who was overall Eighteen and six against the lions Aaron Rodgers has fared well against Detroit as well Thirteen and three thirty for touchdowns and six\nInterceptions factors have won all eleven games against the lions when Rogers records of passer rating of one hundred plus\nHe is Thirteen career wins over the lions Aaron Rodgers does that is tied with French architect and why a table for second most ever\nBrett Farr beat them twenty six times with the Packers and the Vikings Rogers is third for regular season touchdowns thrown against the lions thirty four behind ... fifty eight and Johnny United says forty\nIn each starts at Ford Field Jeff Rogers is six and two was Seventeen touchdown passes three interceptions and of course everybody remembers the Hail Mary winter a few years ago\nIt's not quite like the silverdome days or when that place is always difficult for the Packers but yeah this has been a pretty evenly matched series over the last ... years going back to that twenty Fifteen Years you mentioned the elbow of course the lines came to level field in one in Wisconsin for the first time since Nineteen Ninety One obviously Detroit sweeping last year but Bradley started both of those games up\nSo I think like anytime you go on the road and anytime you have a division of game it's always tough but with Aaron Rodgers getting healthier and then you feel pretty good about where the Packers are right now\nAaron Rodgers last night and obscene or ths division games seven one and one was twenty three touchdown passes and zero interceptions one roster note on

either a trade or a contract dissension got neither broke his leg or one finger salute to his own sideline last week or what is this future\nWell hey you know it's hard to say just point out is what I noticed immediate future there apparently\nAnd it'd be inserting a ride to make it more stable should be fine and it will even work out from the beginning of free agency in March or he'll turn Thirty years old and may there are safety sue are still in their prime for a couple of years at that point so I think\nIt will be in demand or one of the things that that he had his representatives pointed out is that he's been careful to maintain a really solid relationship with his teammates or his ... that he's upset about\nThat too he was with a number two the other day and I would still be seen really tough to bring back\nThe question I think is going to be where it's Seattle that are they building or just a re arming on the fly if they think they can be competitive next year they never didn't want a top unless they just didn't want to renegotiate a deal that they had already given him an early extension not so\nI Would say it's likely he'll go elsewhere in free agency but according to what I'm hearing about the possibility that they find a way to mend fences between our next spring it really depends on where the Seahawks thinker out in terms of being competitive [noise]\nHow how do you see the eagles Vikings game a rematch of last year's NFC championship game playing out today\nYou know I Wish I could figure out what's going on with the Vikings since really a puzzle they they have not played well on opening day at on against San Francisco and haven't played well sense now\nThey've had some issues but really you know not as any interesting issues as other teams have obviously the the case of Everson Griffin is disturbing we don't know a lot about it appears to be psychological issues and\nHe is a very important later on that team and I'm sure ... some people up but there's more than enough talent left and on defense\nYou know they should just be playing better football than they are this is not a must win situation but that's about as close as you get and there's the bench factor these guys don't forget they know what happened championship game last year in Philadelphia\nAnd the last three games this season seven touchdown passes one intercept\nIt was the last four or five years I'm Stafford just seems to keep getting better and better and I think would you look at the talent that surround them this year he's he's very dangerous and as we talked about us three wide receivers that can go off and can be the primary wide receiver it anytime Kenny Golladay was huge week one ... Jones was open a quite a bit against San Francisco we too\nAnd gold and take you know and it began last week against Dallas so it's not just on that you Stafford he's surrounded by pretty good talent and what I thought was interesting about what Detroit did in the offseason obviously you're bringing a new coach you expect a lot of coaching changes the good news Jim Bob ... back\nAs a fence of coordinator but you know I I think you want that continuity and that and that hasn't been what the lines were thinking a and retaining if Bob could or that you know Matthew Stafford is played so well over the last ... seasons you're right you need a one hole in his resume he doesn't have that postseason when\nAnd I think it's getting tougher Detroit to get to the ... and now a at one in three but you know he was banged up a lot in week one against the jets are the one thing that has really held back Detroit's often I think there's some similarities between the lines in the Packers it's been an execution intervention drops\nBut not East Africa has been under siege or you know he's been ... quite a bit already here in the first four weeks of the season so again I think this is a good test or for the Packers pass Russia's you when you consider the injuries would die or Alexander out really not ready to play and he's out as well\nThis is a secondary that's going to be tested so you're going to need your address just to get the Stafford and of course\nGonna look for pressure of the middle as well so expect the defensive line to uh definitely be on alert 'cause you gotta carry on Johnson's well\nLion Jim Bob Quinn had said hey it all starts up front so Markey\nInvested a lot in the offensive line or they've tried to renovate the running game they have their first one hundred yard Russia and almost five years when Carrie Johnson law let's be honest the only rush for a hundred one in back of the gay guys but they got\nThey got over that a drug they also have the Garrett blood and as a winning Larry talked about the CEO Rick as well\nSo do you look at the lions now as a better running game a team than they were\nWell I think they're they're trying to stick to it a little bit more than I think they realize\nYou Matthew Stafford talented guys able to throw it all over the place but it's been said five years and although it's only a hundred and one yard I think that gets a monkey off of the back of the old line because that question keeps popping up and it's something I don't think anybody wants to sit there and deal with so they're sticking with it I think they they feel like they have\nKind of like what Green Bay has a bunch of different towns get theoretically is great out of the backfield matchup problems in the past in game so they're trying to figure out\nAll right we can't just continue to put this on Matthew Stafford we want to be able to run the football because that makes protecting him easier and that's something they're putting a bunch of resources in time and and they want to start seeing those diminish pan I guess last week is the first time they've been able to see that in the last four or five years\nCarry on Johnson second round pick out of Auburn averaging almost six yards\nPer carry golden tape in his contract year on pace for career highs and catches yards and touchdowns Tuesday stop to help people in an accident he's doing everything in Detroit Lions have not wanted division titles since Nineteen Ninety three now Jeff when we look at their defense\nAnd Aaron Rodgers is three hundred and sixty eight passing yards away from forty thousand in his career\nYou would think I'm just guessing here that the dairy a sleigh was a very good quarterback will be matched up with the ... they had um ... who's healthy and starting so then the young receivers have to prove their metal\nYeah I think it's the same as it ever was but that Detroit secondary it's about you got to identify where slay is and if indeed that's going to be the matchup today play against that and so of course we know is not one hundred percent\nUh how much of the three rookies are are going to be counted on here I'm ... and Detroit also is defensively you know Matt Patricia once this team to be more physical I think that's why you're seeing off instantly they've been trying to run the football more and and I think that's the case defensively and\nUh you know a couple of guys over the last few years that they have acquired um Jerry Davis and Devon ... are guys who can get out the quarterback and so we ought to is out and you know again he he's a guy who's been just absolutely tremendous but has been marred by injury so much that he's never been able to reach us potential in the past it seemed like well if you factor out on so\nYou're out on so you should be able to pick apart the lion secondary even with\nSlave back there I don't know that that's necessarily the case here so you know again our mobile Aaron Rodgers is going to be how comfortable he's going to be moving around I think it's definitely going to be important but it definitely seems like the the kind of afternoon where you invested three draft picks him three wide receivers this the day for them to step up\nLions at one only one playoff game and the last sixty years they come in this season ranked thirty second that's last in ... so as much as you want to talk about the rookie receivers that might go down to the Packers now run again\nI mean part of it is you know you'd go back to last week and a lot of the cowboys is equal Eli went off and get twenty five tear each had a huge get of\nCourse the Packers don't have is the lead on the roster but as we've all talked about all wondering are we going to start to see more of Aaron Jones and will they be able to exploit this ... defense because even earlier in the season the jets and the forty niners mean those are teams\nThat you know sort of do a little more running back by committee like the Packers do they had success run into football as well so could very well be a balance back today\nLions have Thirteen sex or were the first four weeks with just three of them coming from the defense of lines

Dennis Crosby mark tells your Jeff colonial\nAnd in the U.S cellular broadcast booth at Ford Field in Detroit west hot too which of Packers dot com\nMark I know you love multiple choice questions so here you go oh what's the Packers defensive performance shut up over buffalo bay a sign of dominance things to come be a step forward or see\nDidn't mean much at all because it gave against the rookie quarterback\nI'm going to be a great job done she gave a little bit of variance with your faith that I wasn't the extremes that you normally like I I think anytime you're playing a game and you you can only do what you can only play against the people on the other side I think buffalo is often\nIs not very good I think they have a rookie quarterback that I think my ... that are really good job of scheming things up where you took away his first read yeah heated him up and I caught the defense did exactly what it was supposed to do but\nTo annoy them as they've solved all the issues I still think\nYou know against the the big test or against today will be a great test you have good skill position players you have a quarterback that is seen things and could pick things apart so this will be a really good test but you have\nTo have building blocks and last week I caught was a building block and a game that you get a lot of confidence you got some turnovers you did what was that but I I I you also have\nIn the personnel you're going against that I think it's going to end up with one of the worst officers in the NFL\nThe answer's definitely be an issue is certainly a step forward and you know it's interesting when you look at Buffalo's a playoff team last year all the changes to the coaching staff the office of personnel and they clearly have been jailed and and there's no question that one of the worst teams and the national football league but\nHey ... you know did lead it ought to put twenty seven points on the Vikings the week before um so yeah we don't do a quarterback sure um but yes it's a rookie quarterback and and yes there are depleted all eventually in terms of talent but it's still the national football league and\nI I think any time you can shut out a team you have to take notice that I don't think you could just brush it off and just saying well it's it's up against a rookie quarterback\nOr but I think a lot of what the Packers didn't in week for has to carry over to this we can do you have to look at stopping to run you have to look at putting some pressure\nOn the quarter back in ... to give up the field author down to take away so you know those those big play those all have to be there but now as Martin mentioned of course stating the obvious here it's much more challenging this week because off actually I think a running back in the wide receiver\nA and obviously the quarterback Detroit far more talented the buffalo but it's a good foothold\nYeah this was a perfect time for shut out because I think the very least it shows the defense of what it is capable of it and what could potentially be in the cards for it when things fall together and as you guys mentioned obviously Josh Allen Matthew Stafford nobody's going to confuse the two at this point in their careers\nBut I think something like that can really give them the job that they need going into a game like this because I mean while\nThe lions have a lot of our fence of weapons are three receivers I mean you can't you know you nor them at all but at the same time I don't still consider them to be one of the top teams in the NFL from that regard so I just think that you get that went over buffalo you shut 'em out you really shut them down now you come into force field here you can maybe build upon that here\nNow your role and then he got San Francisco and thereby so yeah for what happened to the stretches that they had where they played well and then they'd say played poorly and a quarter and then that would tilt everything I just think that that was the full ... fourth quarter is a football that\nMy ... really wanted to see from his guys\nThis is a question I don't like to ask and I didn't think I'd have to ask you this year but here goes the first place bears are off today they have a by here's a question mark what are the chances the bears when the NFC North [noise]\nMinimal I I don't I don't I just I Need to see more from ... yeah I think their defense is good I think they're going to continue to improve\nBut I'm not on the I'm not going to be a prisoner the mom and just because he threw six cut up against the bad guy like that ... the ... I Need to see more so I'm always going to go quarterback when you know things are in that position and I still believe Aaron Rodgers is the best\nI think that that always trumps everything else and I think Chicago still has some some learning curves that they're going to go through so I I Am impressed with what they've been able to do and I think pulling back a is an absolute coup so that defense is good but I still don't trust the quarterback\nUm with mark on that um there's no question there rolling defensively and obviously a very good game for march march misty last week but ... that's ... ... ... where I get confused but I go back to the Seattle when the Arizona when you're ... and I think was\nReally impressive in the second half of those performance the same thing was weak one against the Packers I Would also summit Dennis\nLook at Chicago's schedule and the second half of the season when they have to play Detroit twice including once on Thanksgiving they still go play the Vikings twice they got to play the rams they get to the Packers at home\nThat's where the division is going to be won or lost so I think it's definitely waiter see I don't know if you want me to put a number on this but I Would say less than fifty percent\nI just before we go to west oh I just want to say this about ... he's not going to throw sticks touched on that very often however maybe just needs to be competent for them to be tennis\nMaybe just needs to be competent for them to be ten and six you know what that effect\nI'm maybe I'm but I think that's only going to get you so far and is tennis it's going to be enough to win the\nWest yeah yeah and the thing that I kind of waiting to see is is you know you're busy do this on a consistent basis entity can\nYou know ... where are those are the ... the owners as pretty well\nA good visiting and I'm going to talk with everyone under it's awesome things like that you can get out and get to the edge so he can do a little bit of every game or I mean you know like we're in them and they come in they kind of a change of pace guards but are given I think a drunk and he goes on\nDetroit has struggled for years to find a formidable running game and with Johnson the lions off and there's a fall into a more balanced attack\nI mean even encourage the arm severed more honor center and um [noise] you know then they run the Baltimore and a and I mean that's as credit to to him are just coming in and you know be ready and uh and you know are not the ruins run your own were real well for them back\nTo last week's performance the question now is the Packers build off the shut out to be sure the wind has the defense feeling pretty good\nIt's a big conference looser uh is uh [noise] you know I think we we do a really a a like a lot of great things a ...\nA ranch with a ... a stream really will so are we do a lot of things good and then I think we really push the longer we're all the facts either that or\nIs it was overall a good performer so we've got to get off of\nThat skinny Clark of the Packers if you work with us last hour several significant developments as far as the game day inactive ...\nDidn't boil Randall ... gyre Alexander but Sean ...

[laughter] yeah I had to write I write about it yeah and I get I get you know I think they they're always trying to find pass Russian ... has been really good against most players not named David Box Gary David is played really well\nSo if I think that's always the issue when you're looking at you playing Green Bay you have enough\nPass rush and they have two guys out today that are going to be able to play that provide a lot of that so\nYeah I Know the talk is running the football at some of the wide receiver issues that Green Bay has but like you said earlier\nDetroit as some issues with help from the back in and do they have enough pass rush because my guess is with Erin yeah kind of making some comments last week or going to see some things open up a little bit and that's going to be an issue for Detroit is do they have enough passed without having to blitz\nYou would think Jeff said because carbon Alice in or out that Detroit's thinking well okay the one guy as far as the receivers we can't let beat us is Adams\nWould think so but of course this should open some things up for Jimmy ... who can't forget about then I ... yeah and and and you know going back to what was awkward said you expect to see more to tighten sets\nUm this week and a lot of it is just the way that the personnel set up for the Packers made against great opportunity for the rookies but where's the trust level um with with Aaron Rodgers obviously that's something that has to be earned but you do have you know guys that that tied in position um that that can catch him\nThe guy said that tied

season a new head coach here seem authentic coordinator here you still you think you might get so much Scott looks this late into the campaign or ... pretty much seen what you're going to see from Detroit\nI figure you know there's always the threat of the sky looks it's just a percentage goes down throw up here I just think of it was first four games average is\nA history of Toyota thirty plus percent so there's always going to be true rankles each and every week uh I think the biggest thing is you know there there are tremendous around and go to the change of philosophy as a football team of soup is here to that or they try to be\nMore wide open what they're passing anyone off ... and ... and ... are relative to see how the playoffs or what their defense\nYou know I'm I'm looking at your situation this week and the feeling I got watching uh the coaches and everything is it\nYour now into the challenge of coaching you have a different school seems like every week due to the injuries and the adjustment you have to make this is really the challenge of getting you had a lot of young guys going to play an office today got a couple of guys missing from the secondary today you've got to it that that's a challenge for you guys just coaches and and this was a rough\nPatch this week just because you know the timing of the injuries and and I think just you know coming out of the extraordinary types of game just as far as the numbers are is number of plays against Minnesota also the heat and\nBe able to travel in the right to wash up and you know we were just a practice really cut back a lot of things and now we're still are dealing with it on a level that's just a challenge in the NFL we knew it you know when the season came out on a schedule came out the season was going to have a rough start to it or just for the two in a big division games come right out the gate so\nThat that that's part of it or you can see that you you know you were their product is one of the thirties Wednesday Thursday was all up and down frankly the only officer practices for was there but that's that's how these which do you go to work through it and I'll tell you I like the way the guys came together here at the end of the week up for like we ever\nDo good playing ... um and we need to go get this one today\nAaron Rodgers a moving it looked like I'll even better last week as his mobility is neat getting better as time has progressed even always played on\nOh definitely I mean I think really you know what's the comparable he sees a playing with fish and stuff for in ... in all of a say he's\nDoing a heck of a job with that but yeah clearly moved buttered us we're going to the last word ... Alice Randall calm today so the young guys have to step in right definitely um is is that there's a point that I read it fell season I today's NFL the young players have to play\n'em your frankly might want to be a little further down the line but at the time is now so we got a couple I was going to play all officers do different on the fence which you know as we know when it really trickles down into the special teams ... at a ... at a higher level so our guys need to step up and play and it's their opportunity and I'm looking forward to seeing him go after\nNext step for the defense last week wasn't an issue in particular ... you know it wasn't until I went back and watch the tape that yeah yeah the three ... to slash plays with the fourth quarter but he seemed to be active in
