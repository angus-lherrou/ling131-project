food\nThere were probably been star and ate their own poop to survive there are several ways to stop it okay no yelling and screaming\nBut I like you do is speak to your veterinarian their products on the market once called bitter there's another product on the market called for big or your vet might say just use a little bit of a locksmith tender either you mix that with the dog food and medical your breaks the food up\nAnd gives you the horrendous taste that may be enough to stop the problem if not listening to me very very carefully what I Want you to do is go to the supermarket and buy

[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWell here's what I Would recommend that you do besides using ear plugs when you go to sleep well here's the other thing I Would recommend that's important when you react to something like barking and it's not accessible parking your case it's just short term barking when you react to\nRecommend that's important when you react to something like barking and it's not accessible parking your case it's just short term barking when you react to that by grumbling are saying no or for whatever you do you're actually reinforcing that behavior so my recommendation is twofold to you\nNumber one especially in the evening before you go to sleep that's when they need a little politeness or aerobics class really exercise them a lot at that point what time is there last feeding at night\nAre typically about six thirty\nOkay six thirty is fine you might want to feed them a little bit later you might want to break the six thirty feeding it to six thirty in a little bit more\nMaybe around seven thirty eight o'clock a full belly helps them sleep a little bit better as well but in terms of the barking at this point I Would not react to it I Would just cover your head at this point it will stop eventually but once you react when you're actually reinforcing the behavior which is going to make the problem a lot worse\nTypically don't yell at them or or lone stars them at all\nThen what I Do don't do anything they don't even don't even make believe you're hearing them\nOkay and what you described earlier about their hearing ... all those\nHot so in other words you guys are losing your hearing as well ... yeah well not believe me it happens I'm getting a little over there myself it does happen I'm so in other words the possibilities that you're losing your hearing as well um\nSo maybe you're hearing it differently than you heard it when before you started losing hearing also but anyway the resolution really easy would I Want you to do is just basically ignore the barking it will dissipate with time I promise but if you try to correct it at this point I Know no food or whatever it's not going to it's not going to resolve the issues of give that a few weeks give it a shot let me know how you're making that\nUm do you think he would you ever get a tattoo of you to golden retrievers walk\nI Would learn I was just a lifestyle but I Know people of all

dirt and grass then what I Want you to do is pick a day or two when you have nothing to do maybe a weekend but watch your little having these puppy don't give the puppy the opportunity to go inside therefore when you take 'em outside\nExercise I'm running around and play with them because after exercise and will create a scenario where he's going to have to put but listen to me carefully how long did you say the puppy was Martin\nHe's working week now\nOkay when a puppy first wakes up they're going to have to poop when a puppy first gets exercise they're going to have to poop\nSo what you
