and he obviously was not a socialized to many things which we've been working on for a year\nUm we also had professional trader come to the house for about eight sessions to work on the dog aggression\nAnd it's gotten better but it's not short and he uh\nYou talk about the ... dog when you take it for a walk he he can turn on the drop of a dime it'd be very aggressive\nI Will let me ask you yeah let me ask you a question Kevin when you take 'em for a walk and he turns into crew Joe what is the trainers suggest that you do at that point\nWe train him with the command called law which calls for him to sit and look up at us and she said to get his attention with that command either until that dog passes or for us to redirect them and go a different direction\nOkay so then what you're doing by following that advice and nothing against the train but what you're doing by following that advice if you're paying attention to the fact that your dog is acting like ooh Joe and by paying attention to the fact you're reinforcing that\nBehavior the training aspect is fine but when the dog is reacting in an aggressive manner\nWhat often happens is the guardian or you when the dog is reacting that way you're going to react by making the dogs ... making the dogs stay the dog is already uncomfortable because he sees another dog if he's already uncomfortable by using those basic commands what you're doing is making them even more uncomfortable\nHere's what I recommend you do and it's going to sound a little crazy but I've been trained over forty thousand talk I think you agree with me\nWhen you're taking your dog for a walk\nAnd he reactor sees another dog I don't want you to do a thing I Want you to continue walking straight ahead\nIf you want to say it's none of your concern that's fine but don't stop once you stop you or reinforcing that\nBehavior so just keep walking don't stop after you go past the other dog maybe oh thirty or forty feet you can pat I'm On the head don't react to just keep walking that's the way to resolve that sometimes the best resolution to a problem is really a simple resolution like that so what often happens\nIs when I have a dog that's aggressive towards another dog they pulled the dog back they say no bad dog sit stay down all of this has to be taken into consideration from what you just told me the dog had three different SPCA before you got him\nFirst of all every time he goes in the car he assumes he's going to be a band\nAnd again that's why he's reacting that way when he sees another dog because he spent so much time around the dog's different shelters\nHe assumes the other dogs may be assertive or how for aggressive towards him so what you need to do is let him know no reaction is necessary because because that dog is across the street as long as you keep walking straight ahead\nDon't react to it little by little not overnight but he will come around I promise that makes sense to you there Kevin\nIt makes a ton of science and I'm going to employ that I served a thank you for that and some advice\nAnd and it doesn't happen overnight please give the dog a little bit of a break you had three different homes already and sometimes they had these abandonment issues they become really really attached to the people there was\nAlso the more socializing you do to better off you know what how many do Kevin let me do sign up for Kevin on hold and Kevin I'm actually going to send you a copy of my book how to get your doctor do you want\nAnd the reason I Want you to read the book is because not only will teach you the basics but more importantly\nThan the basics and will teach you how to build up the dog's confidence the dog self esteem and that's going to make all of the different the

first Steve is up\nIn I Believe it's Rosedale Hey Steve welcome to show\nA warrant great to talk to your actually it's Rosendale were up in the Hudson Valley a couple of hours north of the city\nOh okay I Know there's a Rosedale on Long Island where I happen to grow up I didn't know\nI Know I Know I remember yeah what can we do have a lot to me tell you started out we recently adopted\nA rescue dog to be a companion to our eight year old should sue poodle who's a wonderfully sweet dog but we lost our other dog with a Maltese two years ago suddenly so we rescued this new dog he's turned that we did a DNA test on he's mostly Chihuahua and a little bit of Sean so he's like a Chihuahua and be Sean clothe the\nFact that combination Barker\nHe's a year and a half old uh he's great he's very sweet they get along fabulously the two dogs love each other\nThe problem is main problem is he's very afraid of fear thing a big dogs he's kind of hyper and nervous a lot of the time so we don't know what his first year and a half or so was was all about\nBut when we go on walks boy oh boy if he sees a dog bigger than an even several blocks away or if it happens to be right next to each barking like crazy out of control\nAnd we've been working with a trainer through the rescue place you know ... it's ... it's when he's around it works great\nWith doing it by herself to start because sometimes what\nWhat what are you at what are you let's say you're sitting at the park you have your dog he sees another dog what happens and what do you do a\n... what we've been doing is we're really try to get them away from the situation\nHow does that resolves well how does that resolving\nA well he'll try to but we we try to get them away when he gets calm\nAnd how how does how does how does getting him away from the situation that's creating a problem resolve the problem\nWell the idea is to give him when he was calm give them a treat and you know it works great\nBut they don't listen listen listen to me carefully okay the dog we acts like ooh Joe he sees another dog and he goes crazy with the trainers told you to do is remove them from that area and calm him down and give them a treat what did you just do\nA year I heard before you it's reinforcing\nExactly you just totally dog that that's what happened to use what you need to do and it's just so important to understand that when you have a dog ditch reacting you need not to react the minute you react you creating more reaction on the dog's part\nThe ... the mini your dog sees another dog and starts reacting you can't stop you pull back on a leash as long as you pull back on a leash\nHe's going to pull forward on a leash becomes a tug of war making him more assertive that's how guard dogs are trained what you need to do is when you're walking him and you take them for what you should follow your trainees instructions and do your basic training dog needs to know how to sit down and come I understand that\nBut as long as you react to the dogs misbehavior in some way where he is getting attention for it and a treat for it you're not going to resolve the problem here's the resolution your dog learns how to learn to understand that when he walks to pass\nThe big dog nothing is going to happen nothing good is going to happen nothing bad is going\nTo happen nothing is going to happen so here's what you do when you're walking your dog and he sees another dog\nHe's got I'm assuming he's a Chihuahua mix it was on a harness and you're walking past another dog and he starts reacting rather than stop rather than say anything you just continue walking if you want you can say it's not a concern and don't stop once you're on a block or so away passing\nHim a pat on the head if you want don't make 'em do any training at that\nPoint but the bottom line is he starts to learn there's no need to react that way your reacting to his reaction the resolution to behavioral issues is to get the dog not to react in the first place and the way to get the dog not to react to let him know that this is no\nBig deal so your trainer is okay and I know what you're saying in a lot of training approach it that way but the ... let me tell you\nI Am taking dogs out of the worst dog fighting rings in New Jersey and New York I\nHave worked with dogs that have been on the streets in South central LA that dog fight every day of the week that is the resolution not being tough with them not being asserted with them not taking them to a different area but making them understand that walking past ... nothing's gonna happen\nTherefore there's no need to react disaster resolution I Would recommend Steve it makes\nIt can understand that walking past ... nothing's gonna happen therefore there's no need to react disaster resolution I Would recommend\nIt makes sense but I've just weren't question out there when he's pulling in polling in particular standing up and all this is like direct to get them to keep walking is basically dragging him along the street but you're not going to just walk it it's not as to gentle barking\nWhen we bought here's here's what you need to do you need to walk him in a situation where let's say you were I don't know detect very you live and maybe there's a dog park or maybe there's an area where people walk their dogs when you started out walking in an area where he's not right on top of the dark and other words maybe a hundred yard he's not reacting to the dogs at all\nAfter you've done that for a couple of days and he's not reacting and get a little bit closer if he's reacting go back to the further distance little by little when he realizes that nothing bad can happen he's just going to stop doing something he's told me a little bit at this point is going to the other dogs you don't want to react that way\nAnyway follows you Steve I'm gonna put you on hold I'm gonna send you a copy of how to get your doctor do you want to
