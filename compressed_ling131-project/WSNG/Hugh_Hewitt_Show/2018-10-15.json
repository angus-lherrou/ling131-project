basement an upstairs right\n... yeah I wouldn't even know why she's doing that\nThough there are many many many reasons why she's doing your husband put 'em down stairs or the first association with comfort is probably downstairs they probably feel more comfortable downstairs and yet what we need to do because there's less activity there we need to bring them upstairs and let them realize that being upstairs is fine now one of the biggest mistakes that people make with cats\nThey don't spend enough time socializing and they just assume if it's a cat and want to hide let it high that's with cats do\nYou have a really affectionate animals as you well know softer highland downstairs where they're spending time downstairs\nAnd they're not being socialize I'm sure you're spending more time upstairs and downstairs bring them upstairs close the door to downstairs but before you bring them up make the upstairs interesting put down some cardboard boxes but there was some paper bags but there are some organic catnip if you make the upstairs dairy\nBecause they're but they're not upstairs what point what's the point I Know well deployed to bring them back to listen to me this is an easy problem don't make it difficult bringing a forecast upstairs closed the door\n[noise]\nI Can't make unity I Can't I Can't make any closer dark brings you know as long as they can get back downstairs and that's their comfort zone they're going to keep running down there we want to switch their comfort zone from downstairs to upstairs\nTo that I'd add doesn't make any difference bring you up here but bring the other bring\nBring all I'm I'm confused bring all four of them upstairs I don't understand the question if you have to get a downstairs or for the downstairs doesn't make any difference to me I Want to all four of them upstairs\nWhen they do they\nClosed the door and listen to be careful you're not listening to me they need to be associated with the upstairs being a positive place what you need to do when I got to move on them or to put you on hold and send you a copy of my book\nBut would you really need to do at this point is bringing afford them upstairs and close the door to downstairs that's what you need to do once they feel comfortable upstairs if you want to reopen downstairs that's fine but for whatever reason two of them were I don't even know if it's to afford them so confused at this point\nYou need to bring them upstairs you're telling me the cardboard boxes are upstairs you tell them you're growing organic catnip for them upstairs this paper bags upstairs\nI don't know if you're changing them every day or not\nBut if the cats are downstairs they're not enjoying what you brought up stairs for them you need to get them upstairs close that door let them assimilate upstairs and then if they want to go up and down their option but right now they're feeling more confident downstairs so they're going to spend more time downstairs which is not particularly got to work in your favor\nAnyway they send you a copy how to get your cat do you weren't\nGive me a call let me know how they're doing but please bring them upstairs and close the
