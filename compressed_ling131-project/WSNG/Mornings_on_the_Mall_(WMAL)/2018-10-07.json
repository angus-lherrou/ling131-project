[noise]\nBrad starts all the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] I think for taking my call they sure how can I Know\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to\nAh we've got about Ninety thousand in and we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nCome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to go a trailer her car she owes about eleven thousand on and ... percent interest [noise]\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because of course are among\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] I'm a truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ...\nWill come because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though so we're good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand okay\nBut not that include the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\nMostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes yeah\nEight to five five to to buy a new job and we'll talk about your life and your money\nWith us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise] good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nYou know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking to you for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college when my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I've about Seventy thousand dollars cash\nMhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on [laughter] I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a chat five twenty nine I think ah for him and then kind of\nPicking out some growth stocks mutual fund\nTo I don't know if she were goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my what do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for for um you know having any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only\nIncome right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shake shack through it towards my how little that every year or should I put it someplace else\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm because that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case and so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is\nPutting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work you\nKnow I have a any tension and um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in to the the card as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay\nAll right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousand and ten thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the rubble and high hundreds\nFor me I'm I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a person that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in robocalls at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would do just go to smart faster Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll\nDrop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business so I don't care what you do okay doesn't affect my income at all but I people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each ...\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that any of the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I'd just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you have you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there\nUm and then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is addressed kids' college and it's different being there in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh\nAny extra money I come into our throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last baby step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house and then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find that my budget um ... keep junk and her on that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\n... I Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury\nHum it as a result of having been a just an old from a service academy or three years ago um and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal that I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off as small as that first or should I I'm just kinda started to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I\nAsk is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount of people\nUm yeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWhile so you learn to you guys are out on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to one thirty thousand bucks this thing or if it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're going to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nServed so little known fact that you are just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year either after served through and lip service or you're assigned to the\nRecruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not that it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving as an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven\n[noise] a yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nWow and so like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that they learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nCommon theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash days\nBind ever has you know but it can happen and can I have\nNo choice on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime\nAnd plug into counseling she has to want to be well yeah and if she does that then she can form a very good life and we are folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things\nYou are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go Mannix\nIn ... oh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself off you know\nOf of her checking account because\nHeart when I got ... more friends obviously not a bright boy show on\nWhile he was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind the rest\nMy case yeah so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing\nFinancially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of internally\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual\nBut to do that was yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go to the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but I don't know if she doesn't\nShe going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating for the people that habit and those that love them\nBut the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only the medicated but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicating\n... you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs there are no no I mean they add controlled or she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen uh as as as semi really mentally ill and she is with us She's not on a couple of different methods and she does\nWell her ... her only shopping is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time so what does she say right now when they call her on ... so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know are you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just don't you know because they're going to just\nI don't think I should be talking she should be telling them\nEither one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna ... her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the death right well\nMy husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know\nSo they get nothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her marriage or you can hear the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there does she say look it can we work at a deal you know or you know are they\nAll your Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will do it and get an an riding and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a film industry\nAnd so you got a free somewhat rattlesnakes because they are [noise] you gotta really tender covering person here going into a rattlesnake thin after she starts making some money you got a warm weather emotionally on this\nOr you can you can give her the cheerleading support the treaties without giving your money and I think you're right to do all of that there's good news you know she can make it out is she makes a good choices

phase the accumulation phase and distribution and then transfer\nYou know when I first got into the industry you know we about Twenty years ago we started evaluating hey we want to start in putting our time into helping other people with their retirement planning and we decided that was the case I don't really know a transfer meant a ride back then\nAnd I realize that it's you know at the end of your life when you have money left you're going to be transferring that to\nYou know they'd have to share spouse or to your children or young to a charity I mean it just depends on\nYou know what your objectives are and ah that's what's great about the rest strategy is that you can actually transfer that to just about anybody that you want to\nUh and you know you you might say well you know today I'd like to do it this way and then five years from now maybe that change it I can change it do you change that anytime you want and so it's not it ... or anything like that\nUh which is a very very important as well so we talked about the first chapter there's actually ten chapters in the book or at the second chapter the triple crown of style sound investing and we know that the triple crown well why don't you you know you're the author of the book why don't you tell us about the triple crown of sound investor\nWell you've got safety liquidity you've got a great rate of return and so these are three very important aspect when it comes to planning for your retirement so safety let's just take that out why did we start a radio program to begin with and fourteen years ago we decided that you know this is\nJust after the two thousand two thousand one hundred thousand to that whole downturn at the economy we decided that we want it to be able to help people to\nSet money aside in a safe position so they could get the outside of the market but also be protected on the downside and there were things that existed that we can share with people now\nUh you know they didn't exist in the nineties but now they do because we have companies out there that are willing to ensure against the law says so whether you're on accumulating money tax free or tax deferred you had those different options it can all be in a safe to position sacred\nSo then we have liquidity which is so important in all of our strategies\nA do include liquidity so you know many times people say well you know the rest read that you sounds good and that's something certainly a leg to a school but I Want a tax free source of income\nBut yet I've spent so much of my lifetime accumulating money in a four O. one K. or an IRA or a T S P a counter for all three be these are all tax deferred accounts\nAnd uh you know short of taking that money is income and and uh uh you know you there's no way really to come out of those accounts tax free so this tax deferred accounts we have to consider those as well and that's why a part of the triple crown solution includes what we call the personal pension plan\nAnd this basically has a plan that we set up as an I. R. A. I. individual retirement account\nAnd you can roll over your for one or your three or four oh three be your your T S P planner or even your existing traditional or rock irate can be rolled into this a personal pension plan and it gives you so many additional benefits that you don't get right now one of our favorite accounts that we utilize\nIs what we call the ten ten I re that is a ... an account that guarantees eight ten percent return annually for ten years all the right I mean think about that\nCould you do better in the stock market I mean we know that the stock market has not average ten percent per year it's average more and we can show you the math I made it really you know after fees and everything it's more than neighborhoods around five to six percent on an average\nUh yet the ten ten IRA is guaranteed ten percent for ten years\nAnd then of course at some point we take that Iran we start income from a higher rate and as we're taking income out of that account the account continues to participate in the upside of the market\nUh so we have increasing income even though we're deep leading a the actual asset or we want to get your information on the ten ten IRA\nAnd uh also the raft strategy would want to get you the free book an illustration\nGive us a call or text us so we can get that in your hands the number to call or text as one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans call or text in your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five ...\nFemale ends if it was eight six six five four four Seventy seven ...\nYou're talking about that third jewel of the triple crown solution and here's an illustration just based on what you were talking about what the ten ten plan and this is I'm putting in two hundred thousand dollars at this individual is eight fifty eight and they said that they wanted to kind of let that growth for the next\nAnd by the time this person is now sixty eight years old they're able to take out\nA over twenty thousand dollars at about twenty thousand three hundred dollars that first year and it does grow as safe as the um increases in the stock market are gonna you know add to this account it's going to grow from year to year so now I like three years later it's eleven thousand one hundred\nI'm Sorry I'm twenty two thousand yeah sorry [laughter]\nI'm looking at the wrong call them here but the twenty two thousand and then\nGrows to twenty four thousand in the south and and so forth and so this is kind of a neat thing to know that when I'm putting in that two hundred thousand dollars at age fifty eight I Know that I'm going to have income for the rest of my life as at least twenty thousand dollars to start with and then it's going to go ahead and grow thrive front there from\nThem this is lifetime income and what we call in and the amount that you're a married that it can be a joint income\nSo that even if you ... your spouse your spouse continues to get paid on an increasing income benefit\nOne of the great things about the ten ten ... is this in ... income you know so many times when we think of a counseling you know you say that dreaded word annuity or whatever what's wrong with the new these well annuities you know kind of stipend you into a a an amount that you're going to receive per year and then it never grows\nSo let's say that you're retired for Twenty years or twenty five years or Thirty years and you're getting twenty thousand dollars a year well you you have no opportunity for that twenty thousand to increase to ... uh you know offset inflation or\nMaybe some of the other things that uh you know you want to take her that are happening around the world around us so ah what the ten ten and I are right we do have increasing income on a de pre shady NASA joint income\nIt also has a a provision in there that if you are you know become disabled where you go into to a retirement home or on assisted living or a nursing home uh for a period of six months or longer that that income whatever income you're a\nAre receiving at that time is going to double for the time that you are and they're up to five years so that's another benefit that comes along kind of along for the ride if you will\nOn the ten ten IRA so if you have an IRA four O. one K. for all three B.

I\nWant to paint a very clear picture about what you were just saying I think this is so important uh you know when let's just say I had a hundred dollars and I lost fifty percent how much but I have a let me do the math [laughter] calculator a fifty dollar fifty dollars then from\nThere if I gain fifty percent\nWell that would be an fifty dollars that would be twenty five dollars\nSo then fifty plus twenty five is now wherever they found some most people when I answered that question they said to me why maybe I got that a hundred hundred dollars and and that's and that's because they're not really critically looking at the map\nIn fact if you take that same equation and you ask as Wall Street what's the return on that they would say oh that to present you ... you gain for not it's actually mine is negative twenty five ... ... and by the way some people say wait a minute ... she got to go the other direction okay let's see that\nOne hundred plus fifty percent is a hundred and fifty take like ... percent is Seventy drive out hey self situation you know ... percent while she would say that's a zero percent return\nSo you gotta be careful about those numbers you had an understanding what compound versus simple interest is\nSo important and you know we've been talking about that for years obviously you go over that in detail in the book\nThe illustrations bring this to life for people I mean I I and of course you know when we sit down in the ... with a client or or a potential client we try to show these numbers as they exist in other words we don't we don't need the pad the numbers they are what they are what they are I mean they're not up for interpretation\nAnd uh when you see them clearly and understand the difference between average and the difference between compound rates of return understand the difference what what is the\nActual benefit of a tax free versus a tax deferred\nAh and you know some of the other things about living benefits how 'bout that benefits how about benefits if I get sick or something happens in my life that you know maybe I'm terminally ill I mean there's lots of things to consider\nA that's all all of these things
