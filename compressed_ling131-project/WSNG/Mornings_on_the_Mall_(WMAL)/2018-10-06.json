Would do that and retiring early or late or yeah it's really up to you know your particular circumstance so you know I just want to kind of calm down let's say you had five years\nAgo before retirement I mean what kind of moves should you be making well before anything else I think you need to see where you stand financially now this was often distaste for the people there really sit down

there's those other phases as well of course uh the growth phase the accumulation phase and distribution and then transfer\nYou know when I first got into this industry you know we about Twenty years ago we started evaluating hey do we want to start in putting our time into helping other people with their retirement planning and we decided that was the case I don't really know what transfer meant a ride back then\nAnd I realize that it's you know at the end of your life when you have money left you're going to be transferring that to\nYou know they'd have to share spouse or to your children or young to a charity I mean it just depends on\nYou know what your objectives are and ah that's what's great about the rest strategy is that you can actually transfer that to just about anybody that you want to\nUh and you know you you might say well you know today I'd like to do it this way and then five years from now maybe that change it I can change it do you change that anytime you want and so it's not it ... or anything like that\nWhich is a very very important as well so we talked about the first chapter\nThere's actually ten chapters in the book will read the second chapter the triple crown to sow sound investing and we know that the triple crown well why don't you you know you're the author of the book why don't you tell us about the triple crown of sound investor well\nYou've got safety liquidity you've got a great rate of return and so these are three very important aspect when it comes to planning for your retirement so safety let's just let's take that out why did we start our radio program to begin with and fourteen years ago we decided that you know this is\nJust after the two thousand two thousand one hundred thousand to that whole downturn at the economy we decided that we want it to be able to help people to\nSat money aside in a safe position so they could get the upside of the market\nBut also be protected on the downside and there were things that existed that we could share with people\nNow uh you know they didn't exist in the nineties but now they do because we have companies out there that are willing to ensure against the law says so whether you're on accumulating money tax free or tax deferred you had those different options it can all be in a state that position sacred\nSo then we have liquidity which is so important in all of our strategy is\nUh do include liquidity so you know many times people say well you know the restaurant that you sounds good and that's something certainly a leg to a school that I Want a tax free source of income\nBut yet I've spent so much of my lifetime accumulating money in a four O. one K. or an IRA or a T S P account or a poor old three babies are all tax deferred accounts\nAnd ah you know short of taking that money is income and and uh uh you know you there's no way really to come out of those accounts tax\nFree so these tax deferred accounts we have to consider those as well and that's why a part of the triple crown solution includes what we call the personal pension plan and uh this basically is a plan that we set up as an I. R. A. I. individual retirement account\nAnd you can roll over your for one or your three or four oh three be your your T S P planner or even your existing traditional or rock irate can be rolled into this\nA personal pension plan and it gives you so many additional benefits that you don't get right now one of our favorite accounts that we utilize is what we call the ten ten I re that is a ... an account that guarantees eight ten percent return annually for ten years in the right I mean think about that\nCould you do better in the stock market I mean ... we know that the stock market has not average ten percent per year it's average more and we can show you the math I made it really you know after fees and everything it's more the neighborhood of around five to six percent on an average\nUh yet the ten ten IRA is guaranteed ten percent for ten years\nAnd then of course at some point we take that Iran we start income from a higher rate and as we're taking income out of that account the account continues to participate in the upside of the market\nUh so we have increasing income even though we're deep leading a the actual asset or we want to get your information on the ten ten IRA and I'm also the raft strategy would want to get you the free book an illustration\nGive us a call or text us so we can get that in your hands the number to call or text is one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\n[noise] to get your free rap strategy savings plans call or text in your names email and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five just ...\nName female and the ... to eight six six five four four Seventy seven ...\nYou're talking about that third jewel of the triple crown solution and here's an illustration\n... you're talking about that third jewel of the triple crown solution\nAnd here's an illustration just based on what you were talking about with the ten ten plan and this is I'm putting in two hundred thousand dollars at this on individual is age fifty eight\nAnd they said that they want it to kind of let that growth for the next ten years and so and by the time this person is now sixty eight years old they're able to take out\nA over twenty thousand dollars at about twenty thousand three hundred dollars that first year and it does grow as say as the um increases in the stock market are gonna you know add to this account it's going to grow from year to year so now like three years later it's eleven thousand one hundred\nI'm Sorry I'm twenty two thousand yeah sorry [laughter]\nI'm looking at the wrong call I'm here but the twenty two thousand and then\nGrows to twenty four thousand thousand and so forth and so this is kind of a neat thing to know that when I'm putting in that two hundred thousand dollars at age fifty eight I Know that I'm going to have income for the rest of my life of at least twenty thousand dollars to start with and then it's going to go ahead and grow thrive from there from\nThen on this is lifetime income and what we call in and the amount that you're a married that it can be a joint income\nOr so that even if you pre deceased your spouse your spouse continues to get paid on an increasing income benefit\nOne of the great things about the ten ten ... is this in ... income you know so many times when we think of a counseling you know you say that dreaded word of nudity or whatever what's wrong with the new these well annuities you know kind of study and you into a a an amount that you're going to receive per year and then it never grows\nSo let's say that you're retired for Twenty years or twenty five years or Thirty years and you're getting twenty thousand dollars a year well you you have no opportunity for that twenty thousand to increase to ... uh you know all of a sudden inflation or\nMaybe some of the other things that uh you know you want to take her that are happening around the world around us so ah what the ten ten and I are right we do have increasing income on a deeper shady NASA joint income\nIt also has a a provision in there that if you are you know become disabled where you go into to a retirement home or on assisted living or a nursing home\nUh for a period of six months or longer that that income whatever income you're a\nAre receiving at that time is going to double for the time that you are and they're up to five years so that's another benefit that comes along kind of along for the ride if you will\nOn the ten ten I raced so if you have an irate four one K. for all three B.

money that they've set aside and they just want to see that gross that they can use it in the future or they want to provide for like I said now I Know that when you and me have sat down and talk about our future those are the three things that we've felt like we wanted to have in place since ... some of our own\nA ... advice right here we bring our own cooking and we actually do have those are things in place we have the income side of it now we are focusing on the the accumulation side of it and you've also put together a really nice legacy plan for you in\nIn in our own personal circumstances we haven't started taking distributions from many the account so we set up yet I mean we're not in a in a position we really don't need to do that we're in the frat house right now the French with that [laughter]\nAnd uh so at some point you know and that's a good thing because the longer that these kind of percolate\nA circumstance where we lose a in a given year twenty percent well now we can't just come up twenty percent to get back up to even we have to even come up higher than that\nIn order to get back up to even and so you have to look at the compound rate of return the compound rate of return even though it's\nThey even we have to even come up higher than that\nIn order to get back up to even and so you have to look at the compound ready to return the compound ready to return even over the last ten years will rise\nAs bad if we just take those five or those last ten years has been under six percent per year now you know when we can we can say hey you know you can have the ten ten IRA which guarantees you ten percent for ten years guaranteed right\nAnd then followed up by increasing income for you and your spouse with you know a lot of other benefits that go associated with that\nThat's why so many people say wow I'd like to learn more about that I Want to see an illustration on how that works how can the company did they know what are the ratings are the companies that offer this these are all very very very good questions and we want to get those answers in your hands get you the illustration and the book\nThe number to call or text so we can

sex and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five ...\nProvide your name female ends of shows eight six six five four four Seventy seven ...\nI Want to paint a very clear picture about what you were just saying I think this is so important uh you know when ... let's just say I had a hundred dollars and I lost fifty percent how much but I have a limited amount\nCalculator a fifty dollar fifty dollars then if they're if id fifty percent well that would be an fifty dollars that would be twenty five dollars and fifty put twenty five is now we're having some most people\nWhen I asked that question they said to me while I may be that got that hundred hundred dollars and and that's and that's because they're not really critically looking at the map in fact if you take that same equation and you ask as Wall Street what's the return on that they would say oh well that's you know present\nYou ... you gain for not it's actually mine is negative twenty five ... ...\nAnd by the way some people say wait a minute ... she got to go the other direction okay let's see that one hundred plus fifty percent is a hundred and fifty take like ... percent is\nSeventy five okay so situation you know ... percent while she would say that's a zero percent return so you gotta be careful about those numbers you got to understand what compound versus simple interest is\nSo important and you know we've been talking about that for years obviously you go over that in detail in the book\nThe illustrations bring this to life for people I mean I I and then of course you know when we sit down and they will meet with a client or or a potential client we try to show these numbers as they exist in other words we don't we don't need the pad the numbers they are what they are what they are I mean they're not up for interpretation\nAnd uh when you see them clearly and understand the difference between average and the difference between compound rates of return understand the difference what what is the actual benefit of a tax free versus a tax deferred\nAh and you know some of the other things about living benefits how 'bout that benefits how about benefits if I get sick or something happens in my life that you know maybe I'm terminally ill I mean there's lots of things to consider\nA that's all all of these things really go into a that would be what I started out the program what the wiz was what is that decade that you need to you know the first five years what do you need to be thinking about what do you need to be considering\nAnd uh so that when you do go into the retirement phase where you're going into that ... page now you're utilizing the assets that you've accumulated all your life\nThat you're not shell shocked that you're not surprised that you have a plan in place\nAnd that plan is going to provide your needs it's going to provide all of the needs of either\nOf you and your family and and uh provide you with the opportunity to have not only a dignified retirement and enjoy your retirement and be able to do the things that maybe you've been wanting to do all your life so uh we want to help you to understand

forth he can definitely pick their brains when they get\nIn and do that or not right you just want the book and the illustration I mean so there's\nThere's a lot of ways that we can be of assistance or two or almost everybody out there another reason the rat that we've been on the radio for over fifty years right is that we don't take ourselves too seriously I think we you know we like to have a little fun on our program I we do these little did easier uh each and every week that we feel are\nUh you know kind of personal and\nAnd uh one of the things that one of my favorite parts of the program I because I'm a negative guide her to say no I'm not going to help guide but it's what we call the book report\nLoves you\nInside David and Laura die for the\nThat yeah\nSo I'm going to talk about a ... ... is Iran is a fly above the U.S a fly in the book right\nSo you know here we are I mean we always say yeah we're in Washington DC but today we're we're we're actually doing our program from Provo, Utah okay and we're spending two months out here\nI ... attends a college okay she's still you know always furthering her education she's been doing online classes are for years now and we decided to let her actually do a\nA a what we call a summer semester right I got her at a uh a Brigham Young university here in Provo, Utah\nAnd what a wonderful thing this has been for us because not only are we you know did we get a great place to stay but provost like write the mountains and I was out his body and things to do around here I never realized in fact I was a little bit reluctant to ah make the commitment of collaborative most but now that I'm here I'm like oh wow this is awesome right\nSo and it's so beautiful and everything but one of the things that everybody does around here is they fly for that [laughter] okay\nNow I'm a fisherman okay and I you know I we\nLive in Florida and you know I have a boat and you know we go out fishing two three times a week and and but this is a whole different world out here you are in streams and you're standing in the water and and you know you're using and it's very shallow when you have to use for highs and so you know I'm learning how to fly fish and\nYou know the first thing that I realized okay about learning how to fly fishing is that you have to have good eyesight right because these flies are so tiny actually and you've got to the thread them through the needle above that\nAnd I got to tell you you know I'm In my sixties and my eyesight isn't what it was as a wow that's a wake up call okay so that's a that a little bit bugging me that ah you know I waited this long to learn how to fly for Asian now my ex yeah you know I got my I got my ah what's it called readers\nThat with me I hit my memory you know you can't have your your learning right now I ...\nBut you know there's certainly techniques to do and ... and Dr ... and uh you the currents in the river and you know the audio the go round the ... I mean it's just amazing but it's been a real great experience so that's my bug okay that I have to have leaders on an order\nI'm Sorry you're not the only reading yeah and I'm sure you're not the only one there's a lot of people I'm sure that they're listening in on this program that that had that same bag I you know\nAnd here's the thing there's a solution you lose this as an end and it's kind of like the flip downtown yeah we all have it on on the other day on shining on your\nHat and then put them down and I I think I've come up with a new invention and routes you're factoring this anyway that's my bug\nSolutions as always solution there's always a solution just exactly like what what we're dealing here there's always a solution or just like the ... could be a solution for you and when I say wrapped it means R.
