I'm not the real guy that guy ... I Know you know she's added again okay Suzie Orman broached the Internet\nEarlier this month when she\nTold a in her podcast is called the Ford anything broadcast that she knows\nThat people buying into the FIRE movement now that's financial independence retire early she's also an acronym are going like you have a a a must save at least five million dollars okay good mochi that\nGoal okay now emails sport in tweets dorms rage\nPom that's where that originates from uh is that in the event of a negative year in the stock market or we're going to get a zero I mean we're not going to make money in a downturn market but we're not going to lose money in a downturn market and sip and since\nMost of the strategies that we employ a do not have ... uh you are actually going to stay completely even no one's going to the doctor or anything even if the market goes up or down\nWell and here's the thing to not super important uh is that when we say principle protection sometimes people go back in the annals of their mind and they say principle protection does that mean that I'm just not going to lose the money that I put into it\nWill yeah but it's more than that if you're not going to lose the interest also that you recruited within the account or so we're not going all the way back to let you stay with about a hundred thousand dollars in their in ten years from now there's a huge downturn we're not going to bring you all the way back to a hundred thousand of it everything\nOkay so we're not going all the way back to let's just say that a hundred thousand dollars in there and ten years from now there's a huge downturn we're not going to bring you all the way back to a hundred thousand dollars it every single year that she got an tons of increasing that account that is also locked in and that becomes your new\nPrincipal allowed have I gone into the annals of my mind lately [laughter] I Am not familiar with that [laughter] you wouldn't want to me it's like the libraries come on just look it up [laughter] [laughter] wow okay let's\nSay you know what the red eyed I'm inspired right now I think it's time for us okay to do the book reports\nBugs you [laughter]\nInside David and Laura side or the\nEver searching the handles on my mind and I've come up with a father I thought you know it's it's kinda funny 'cause all you know many times we have bugs that are related to our personal circumstances and you know things that happen to us or maybe during the week or the previous week or whatever\nBut I was thinking today I'm I'm really not being bugged right now by too many things in my personal life but\nI Am bugged when people say to me\nThat when they retire they're going to spend less money okay I Am bug by that and I know that's not true because ... you and I are experiencing that 'cause we are semi retired I mean we still do what we love but\nAh but you know for the most part I mean we are semi retired we've delegated a lot of our practice out to a you know our our children are are what we know we do have a family business and certainly all of the advisors that plug into it so we've got\nA a system that's really kind of on cruise control for the most part but one thing that I hadn't really noticed is that my expenses have not gone down as a fact retirement may be much much more costly than you think and I'll just you know I mentioned a few things that from my own personal experience\nThat has caused this number number one I think people don't factor in big ticket items I mean when they look at their budget and they say well I've got my needs\nTaken care of I understand that right\nAnd that's really obviously a very very important thing but how about your once okay and you have your wants to taking care of I mean don't overlook a big ticket items like a on a new car that you might need or one or a repairs to your home which ... you know get more and more expensive\nUh and certainly things that you know maybe we don't budget for and so big ticket items are one of the things that are really you'd you know a lot of people don't consider also\nChanging spending habits are right now in our personal experience I've found what can I here's my thought process what can I buy now that I deserve okay or that I didn't have when I was you know working full time that I didn't even have time to enjoy\nOr a you know the money to to use a for that particular project\nI have an idea okay a boat\nA boat yes yes I Am by about ... and in addition to those vacations okay rabble that we love to do\nYou know hobbies I mean I guess I could put my boat as ... as a hobby\nBut these things cost a lot of money All right and so you don't consider these things how about lending money to kids Laura okay\nThat's another one now we have learned not to try to do that but the the uh we are guilty of that ourselves or spoiling grandkids that's one I can say that's a that's a ... that's what is right in that yeah that's why I Want to spoil\nEven in our parents case though I mean look at my mom for example she just turned eighty years old and she has talked to ever since I can remember since I was six years old she had talked about taking a trip to the holy land okay you know and that's just like\nHow many years ... ... you know Seventy ... some odd years later she's still talking about I said mom now is the time we actually are just selling the house that we bond with her together and we're going to now have the money that you know for her to do that and ...\nAnd ... we don't but we don't have to a company that's like so that they asked for [laughter] well I don't get free ... and really what we already thousand dollar Jeff I Know but we just did it like two years ago so I mean we're not going to go back there again like next year okay and they know the point maybe go\nIceland okay how about the uh let's get back on task okay how about fees that's another one we don't consider\nAnd the big one ... the big one that people just don't consider our taxes okay and we think of these I always we look at our IRAs and her four oh one K. Center for all three ... and we say well jeeze I've got you know\nThree hundred thousand dollars in there well guess what all ... all taxable so you know maybe twenty five or even thirty percent of that is not your money that's money that has to be\nThat go towards the the Texas and these are things that we consider and that's why the rash strategy threat is such a great alternative to an IRA or four one K. you talk about the raft strategy to retirement approach ... attacks\nIn the book I Want you to kind of hit some of the highlights of that before you do we want to make sure you get a copy of\nRaff strategies in retirement approach ... attacks\nIn the book I Want you to kind of had some of the highlights of that before you do we want to make sure and get a copy of the raft strategy in your hands along with brochures and booklets and\nAnd I'm the most important thing of course is the illustration that we provide for you that will show you how these work why they work maybe while your financial advisor hasn't told you about um there's a lot of considerations here give us a call or text us at one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans taller checks and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five ...\nFemale ends of shows eight six six five four Seventy seven ...\nOkay Dave so another point on the back of this book it's says use IRS rules to make Uncle Sam your partner or not you're\nSo okay so what would that mean I mean to me we're not all that happy some kinds of dire as simply because we have to keep on paying taxes\nAnd well we we filed orderly so we have to write a check for always writing checks for the IRS\nRight but there are some parts that were ecstatic about knowing that we have made Uncle Sam my partner and how did we do that\nWhen we did this Ronald rap strategy yeah they we we employed some of the the you know we do eat our own cooking we have a ... a three three rats strategy accounts right now that are going to provide and we still haven't even taken income from them\nOr at this time but certainly the you know part of the plan is that we are going to start taking tax free income from those in the next few years\nAnd that will provide you know a lot of a benefit here not only a living benefit which we receive but it also provides stepped on a phase in addition to\nThat so it's not something we're to strains that David ... created and come up with some idea or the ... and there has been around for a while she'll seeming tougher different animal yeah\nThere you go and do they actually back from the Nineteen eighty okay\nBut here's the thing this is not an old school system when some people say oh yeah I Know about that I learned about that in the nineties I was not the same\nBecause there are some uh vehicles that has changed dramatically simply because of the way that we have principle protection now where that didn't exist in the nineties and there's all different ways that they the companies do there in that scene which is different than what they did back then\nSo there's a lot of competition also in the ... there's a number of companies that are doubling companies triple ... that have been around for ever and ever like over a hundred years\nAnd they have come up with\nA version of the raft strategy and so we're constantly bird talking and find out hey what is the best account for this particular person for their age group and so forth and we can get that information your hand specifically in the form of an illustration that takes into account your life your lifestyle the number to call so that we can get the book into your hands\nThe rats strategy retirement approach free tax in other states investing secrets\nOr the number to call it the eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans call or text and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five\nOr ten and provide your name female and the ... eight six six five four four Seventy seven ... solar\nAnd I have a clip I just got to get this and before because of the segment it's clipped number three\nSons and baby boomers tomorrow [noise] only a few newer with financial security on [noise]\nNinety four percent of Americans have dinner [noise] forty years were there were three percent to shave nothing\nDoesn't it just make you want to take out a reverse mortgage we're in\nA you know I Love that guy's voice that's Tom Selleck man and he's just got the coolest rash the is voice I Would love to hear him sing a song sometime I mean he's he's got a sound like ... Clinton on steroids I mean the idea of just so cool the way his voice is\nAh and ah he looks so good to like this looks good\nBut he ... he's a good point in that you know we have so many people that are retiring every single day ten thousand people a day the ...\nIt gives me a multi purpose is my money and I said well what do you mean by that and she says well if I'd have to wait in my family and taking care of there's a a ballooning death benefit way more money than I put into the account and they're going to be able to have and they're going to be it's going to secure them for the rest of their lives as well okay so that's one one element to it [laughter]\nThat's in a way more money than I put into the account and they're going to be able to have and they're going to be asking a secure them for the rest of their lives with wow okay so that's one one element to it\nSecond is that if I live a long time I'm going to be able to tap into this you know as I live longer and longer and even before I start taking retirement distributions I can utilize this money taking the money out tax free according to iris guidelines\nAnd then thirdly if I get sick or ill there's certain provisions within the account itself that can provide for me like if I you know heaven forbid terminal illness pops up\nAnd guess what you're calling the company saying you know what my doctor said that they're saying okay we'll pay you a check you can you use your death benefit before you actually passed away so there's all these different features and benefits that you don't have with regular account or even\nA you know someone who diesel provide some of that but but this is not an annuity different it's a tax free account that created with your audience companies that have been around for years and years and ah of\nCourse on ... ... attacks all but the rest Reggie is tax free are properly designed properly funded equity indexed contract with an insurance repositories so linked to an equity indexed so you get the upside of the market\nBut you're protected on downside losses it's liquid so important that this is liquid literate so that you can access the money anytime you don't have to be over the age of fifty nine and a half years old it is safe meaning that you'll never lose your money you'll never lose your principal you'll never lose your interest\nAnd it gives you a great rate of return it's averaged over seven percent per year and you might say well seven percent is good yeah but how about seven percent tax\nFree that is fabulous right so we want to get you the book it should the illustrations and get your questions answered and it's so simple to start that process or when you do contact us when you reach out you're going to go to a voice mail system the sleeve is your name your email address so we can email us some information over to you\nAnd your ZIP Code we want to know what state in which you live so that we can provide the information based on the laws of your state so I give us a call or text us at one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plant color sex and your name email and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five\nOr ... female ends of ... a six five four four Seventy seven ...\nWe mentioned all the time that we eat our own cooking and we had our own accounts and we have a couple of wrath strategies going on our own behalf but\nWe don't mention a whole lot that each one of our children also have to do\nAnd in fact uh are are one of our oldest son's Tanner who works with that directly in our business here he called me yesterday says you know my wife is adamant that I get her own\nRaft strategy started because you know he thought his and then she says and and not only that we want one on each of the children as well so he's got he's got a little project ahead of me because I've got to\nKnow create all of these accounts for each of the children as well now why in the world would he want to do that tell us what got us\nI mean you know certainly uh uh well I Know why his wife wants warming you know she's she wants her own security I mean she's a very independent person\nAnd let's just say that to enter a you know died okay yes she would get a ballooning benefit from his 'cause the beneficiary but she wants to have her own lifetime income right and not only yeah and only the lifetime income can only go to the person that actually owns the account so from that perspective I think that um\nAh that that's probably some of her reasoning and then the children I mean certainly for college education that uh come in and around the corner and the beauty of the strategy is is that it can be utilized you can access at the child can access that\nTax free ought to supplement or to altogether pay for a they're continuing education after they graduate from high school I think\n... I mean it's just a foundational part as anybody is a financial planning\nI you know any other things that our children are doing that I'm really proud of is that they are educating their shoulder and\nUh and I think that this is such an important thing to do educating them in the area of finances and they're beginning the process early and often and these are things that are so important for us to do a because you know our children don't get this education in in\nIn school and they don't they don't receive it so anyway get the book the illustration and get started get your questions answered the number to call or text us one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans call or text and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five\nCalls or provide your name female ends at shows eight six six five four four Seventy seven ...\nSo I think it's time for this Belgium\n[noise]\nSeventy seven ... so I think it's time for the ...\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nUm\nHe ... bring that back you know\n... the Tonight Show it's just not the same story about that but you know it was this month in October of Nineteen sixty two the Johnny Carson took over from Jack Parr as the host of that late night talk program the Tonight Show\nAnd Carson went on to host the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson for three decades becoming one of the biggest figures in entertainment in the twentieth century\nThere wasn't a person in America there still isn't that hasn't seen or heard of Johnny Carson and absolutely amazing entertainer who feel their house with laughs and wondered night after night after night it was just such a pleasure to watch them work\nThirty years of consistent quality programming from Johnny Carson if only the red our retirement plans could deliver such linked inconsistency well you know why I think they had\nThe the raft strategy [laughter] I Wish I could talk like I\nHad been banned but yeah so the rest of the G ... you know the retirement approach free of tax I mean are we been talking about this on the radio now for Fifteen Years\nSo you know what entice me when I first started my first one and this is like ten years ago okay that I started my purse trapped account is I\nI I actually did the numbers and I realized that if I were to put aside fifty thousand a year for five years that two hundred fifty thousand dollars right and then wait another five years to start you know before I start taking distributions\nUh I was actually able to take out around forty thousand dollars per year but if I wait another five years after that it's actually more about Seventy five thousand dollars per year okay forget the magic words\nEvery year tax retired ... some Seventy five thousand so this is why did it I was like I said he knows that because I Want Seventy five thousand dollars a year coming to me tax free because I feel like when I'm sixty five years old that's going to be it's gonna do a long way towards getting everything I Need to meet my daily need\nYou know it's so interesting how we actually got into this business for ... years ago I had I\nI at the time I hold a mortgage company and of course like many a mortgage brokers and uh you know folks that were in that business we were helping people to access equity of their homes and are there was so much equity going on you know the real estate boom was going\nStrong and there was all these creative financing tools uh that uh you know eventually actually caused the collapse of of a lot of\nBang and I have to buy all you not to interrupt the here's the thing I remember you coming home at night and sane and this is actually written a book ... I'm not feeling great about these mortgages I think that there's going to be held to be paid ... years later when if there's one of them what if something happens in the marketing you called it why I was ready for it\nThink that anyone who was in the business at that time probably unless they were really not engaged in what was going on they were probably suspicious of how this would alternate out\nAnd certainly the federal government should have been aware of it but they weren't so or at least they didn't appear to be a bottom line is is that as we accessed equity people would turn to us at the at the table and say you know what do I do with this money and you know we didn't think that it was proven at that time to invest that money in the stock market\nOdd because obviously home equity is a sacred I mean that's something that you ever want to lose your polling that money out of it you have to create arbitrage with the money in order to make it work because obviously there's a cost\nTo accessing that home equity money and ah I read a book at that time by an author called dog by the name of Doug ... Salt Lake city is called a missed fortune and you know when I read that book I was like wow this is amazing this whole strategy that he's come up with\nAnd so we basically ah you know plugged into a lot of what he did and then of course we uh uh brought into it our own spin on on a number of things and we created the rash strategy\nA and so now we were as we excess equity we could sell the top people will put here because this money is safe it's liquid and it'll give you a great tax free rate of return and that sort of how our practice was formed and\nThen after a short period of time we decided well you know it's probably in our best interest and everybody else that we're working with and not in the mortgage is I mean we're not feeling good about those mortgages let's just help people utilize\nDecided well you know it's probably in our best interest and everybody else that we're working with and not in the mortgage is I mean we're not feeling good about those mortgages let's just help people utilize maybe funds that they have outside of their home equity perhaps it's in the bank or savings or you know or maybe even money that you would normally spend on on other things to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mornings on the Mall (WMAL)", "city": "Torrington", "day": "20"}
