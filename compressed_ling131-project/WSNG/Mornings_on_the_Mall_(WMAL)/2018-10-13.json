the industry and you know what are the trends and a different solutions that we can provide to our clients and\nI really struck me that you know whether it's because we're ... we're talking about how sometimes I'll meet with people and\nAnd the guy's like oh you know we you know I just want to risk on my money and just keep it in the stock market are or what have you and\nIt because they're being brave right and the the gals or sometimes like well you know maybe we should take some chips off the table how this principle protection and and then get the great rate of return is well they're talking about\nAnd I I think sometimes we think that it's brave to put you keep your money all in the market and yet here's the thing you can have the best of both worlds what's funny one of the speakers was saying you know it's like\nGoldie locks okay and he didn't really explain what goldie ... but to me it means that you've got just write porridge right when when she goes into the\nThe cabin of the bears and cheat the three different port both support you got just write porridge that you have principle protection and then you also have the outside of the market\nIt's an sheet three different part both support you got just write poor edge that you have principled protection and then you also have the outside of the market as well so you can actually\nI had the right consequences when it comes to your money so it's not all at risk that you are getting the outside of the market and you are protecting you and your family as well everyone's happy\nWell and you know we're just pleased to help uh educate people on these strategies I mean you know many of our clients say to us or or the people that respond say you know I have my own financial advisor\nAnd we get that we're not uh certainly not in competition if you do have a financial advisor eye and you're happy with that particular person then we ... we feel like you\nOr should continue with that person and we do respect that kind of loyalty um but ask yourself has your financial advisor talk to you about the rash Reggie do you think that maybe you would want to\nDo your own due diligence I mean you know what we found in our own personal lives and and certainly it through the many clients that we have I mean we have over two thousand personal clients were at night\nI and of course we have thirty about thirty five advisors now that work or in our system across the country and they all have their clients\nAnd what we found is that nobody you know we often we up until this dark like nobody cares more about your money and you do okay you might have a financial advisor but he doesn't care about your money more than you do or she doesn't care about your money more than you do [noise]\nSo it's always really important to have your options in front of you and that's the purpose of our broadcast here today we want to\nEducate you on the options perhaps options that are different perhaps maybe even

... ... email ... five foot four Seventy seven ...\nI just wanted to you know I can see that the clock is winding down on our first segment here and I just before before we sign up and and take a break I just want to talk about the agility Seventy five now if you have an IRA four one K. for three B. T. S. P. plan that would not normally be money that you would put into the rap strategy right\nMoney that you put in the rash strategy is outside of those qualified plans although you can take distributions and put them into the raft I mean that's a whole nother\nConversation that may or may not be a advisable or however or if you do have an IRA four one K. for three be you're going to want to listen to us especially a a ... in the second half are going to\nTalk a lot about what we call the agility Seventy five I read this is an amazing account that uh we are really now promoting because you know we always try to bird dogs arrive and find out what the best\nAccounts or right there's a lot of competition in this industry and so different companies come up with different strategies and they're always trying to wind up each other and and I I got to tell you I I the accounts that we're seeing now our way better than they were you know Fifteen Years ago when we are to that I mean\nWe've we've coined if you if you're in Washington DC and you you know you think the ten ten I write well let's say ... okay we we really brought that we brought that account to to Washington DC and we've got hundreds and hundreds of people in the DC area that have\nPlugged into the ten ten irate than we brought in this thirty percent match IRA when that was a a limited time a a really opportunity okay and there was a special promotion going on by a wonderful company we brought it to DC\nUh we talked about it on the airways ... talked about it a lot we have a lot of people interested it's all an incredible account well you know now we're gonna talk about the agility Seventy five because you know as we look out there who said well what's the best thing we can talk about okay and it really depends on your objective right so if your objective is\nI and so let's just say that we choose the U.S and the five hundred that's a very basic index and right\nAnd the S. and P. five hundred we get a ...\nI and so let's just say that we choose the U.S and the five hundred that's a very basic index right\nAnd the S. and P. five hundred we get a six percent return that year ... from the U.S and the five hundred that would be an average year and the U.S and the five hundred six to seven percent right\nEye and now we say it was pretty good six percent are very happy with that but guess spot ... we're not going to be a only when not only going to get six percent we're going to get a hundred and Seventy five percent of six percent\nPay some Seventy five percent at six percent it's four point five so now what we're doing is we're adding the foreign point five percent on top of the secretary that parents so that's ten point five so we\nGet ten point five members return that year for honor in coming out so we got a hunt now these two that that match and this additional a\nReturn that we receive every year are going to work hand in hand with one another to kind of benefits work hand in hand with one another so now we're going to get ten point five percent in that particular\nSo right the first year here we got we got a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars plus ... five percent so updated hundred and thirty five [laughter] and already just after\nThat and the first year in that exam run and of course you know ... if you have a negative year in this in the index that you choose 'cause why you don't lose any money right so you have that\nFlora zero no matter what he ... you'd never going to lose money and the account well how long would that hundred and Seventy five percent go on for do you think\nWell I Know the answer is actually forever\nAnd Philadelphia by by way of which is good that you know so yes you're right [laughter] okay yeah it's not like you know it was only to find yeah right\nBut it's amazing to be OK so this is going to continue this hundred and Seventy five percent what we call it participation rate\nFor as long as you have the account open which hopefully will be for until the day you die right so you will receive\nA hundred and Seventy five percent of indexed returned\nYear after year after year after year after year\nAnd now let's just say we start taking income on the account and we start with an income amount\nAnd that continues to gift and grow ... each year at a hundred and Seventy five percent of the index returns let me give you an example okay and I have a illustration here that I prepared perfect so I'm just\nTrying to let them saying it's like he's going to start out at a certain amount of income and that's going to be on the base but then every year that there is an increase in the marketing your allocation cast what your income is going to increase\nRight so you know very simple okay I'm going to just say I'm fifty five years old and I wish I still was\nFifty five years old and I have a hundred thousand dollars All right and I'm going to roll that hundred thousand dollars into the agility Seventy five Iran might come from I well you know another IRA I have er a a four O. one K. from her previous employer or what ever right\nAnd now I'm going to actually let that money just kind of sit there for ... sake ten years well drilling Aloul I retire Rowan compound right and so now I'm going to do what it's doing and this was based on historical rate of return okay that it's been doing\nWith the criteria that we just talked about and now it's sixty five years old okay ten years later [noise] I'm going to turn on the income okay so my town is gone Rhone would you believe\n[laughter] excuse me I have a cold so I I'm coughing a little bit I Apologize but not much cited okay so about this\nSo from a hundred thousand now it's worth three hundred and eleven thousand dollars or a ... pretty sweet I'm gonna start income on this account by first year's income okay is going to be Fifteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety six dollars no wait a minute ...\nYou just put a hundred thousand dollars in there when you started your incomes over Fifteen thousand dollars which would be Fifteen Percent yeah says yeah credible\nRight so think about that that the withdrawal rate\nBut that's just where it starts okay so every year that the index has a positive return I'm going to get\nA my income is going to go out so in the second year of my income goes up to Eighteen thousand three eighty ... about that ... and the Ford in the in the a fourth year right my income out Twenty one thousand two hundred and fifty two\nIn the six year my incomes twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars a year so I've gone in six years\nFrom Fifteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety six dollars to now twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars and that income continues\nFrom Fifteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety six dollars to now twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars and that income continues to grow\nAnd it's going to continue to provide these benefits and its income I cannot outlive ... let me give you a shocker ... I started income at sixty six right now I'm eighty five mhm okay [noise] my income\nIs sixty seven thousand eight hundred and Ninety six hour and I mean that's really even outpacing inflation out way way higher when his ... has that is\nOne concern you how when you when you retire it's like okay well what happened with inflation I might go into well how can I can I buy the same amount of stuff now with the same money that I have or do I am I going to need more money and\nYou say well here's a here's a thing where I ... I put it in a hundred thousand dollars\nBy the time I'm eighty five years old I've taken up seven hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars huh okay\nIf this sounds like something you'd like to learn about you got to give us a call okay and we'll get your your own illustration I'm going to talk about another illustration and the second that was a fifty five year old how about if I started sixty the numbers look a little even better\nA but let me get you the number they wanted to get you the illustration get should've brochures get your questions answered and by the way that I tell that I say the magic words\nI didn't know you know those are okay no fees right so give us a call ... give us a tax just get the information okay the number to call or text as one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free raft strategy savings plans call or text and your name email and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five\nCalls or provide your name female ends of shows eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five will say\nThat's an amazing I can honestly this is something that had actually just come on to the offering so we didn't have this uh ... four months ago a this is something new or\nWell it's not from a new company you know it's it's it's a a\nHand in hand count that to you know has been around it in yet they then have to do that a hundred and Seventy five percent ...\nRight and you know the companies are in a way that company ... business over a hundred years I mean does this is ... you know we want to that's why we're so ... you know passionate about getting your questions answered on this I went over fifty five year old putting in sixty five or a hundred thousand dollars what I did here's just real quick\nI'm if I'm sixty and I put that same hundred right mhm and now I start income\nAt Seventy one which I Do you know I never thought that our allies require a minute no data to start taking out right and so now rather than Fifteen thousand like it was if I had started at sixty six my income starts at Seventeen thousand four hundred and fifty five dollars a year on a hundred thousand\nRooms I and I\nDidn't put it in till I was sixteen so it's the same ten year period incomes higher because I'm a little bit older and that income continues to go up a you know proportionately I'd a hundred and Seventy five percent index returns I every time we get a positive here in the index so\nOne of the needed probably ... to that says that if the IRA belongs to say the wife\nAnd a ... instead of course it's gonna be her IRA and yet it can last as long as a ... as well like if one were one um spouse for to ... the other than it would continue for that other spouse\nIs that right that's right so you're you're absolutely right so I was thinking the other way round because the men you know the ... but also if you're a male but\nI Want to [laughter] I don't want to even think that we don't think that when they make money because they do well\nOf course [laughter] and ah they have their own IRA [laughter] right\nSo joining come as well yeah say so whoever's free to see is the other one of the income continues to come and how about this for it if you go into a hospital and nursing home or assisted living put up a situation for a period of I I Can't remember the six months yeah long\nThen uh the income will double yeah I've heard of time that you're either spouse right yeah so you have a you know I I think what we call him income doubling are under this all comes with no fees will read All right so you know when we talk about the agility Seventy five and we say\nWe're passionate about this ... this is amazing I mean I\nYou know we always say well what's where's the gotcha what's the catch where you know ... where ... how can you know how can this go south and this is bullet proof so just you know give us a call or text us so we can get you your own illustration\nSo if you think what David same as it makes sense for you give us a call and get the details get the information according to your at your own situation the number to call it the eight six six five four\nYou sense for you give us a call and get the details get the information according to your at your own situation the number to call it the eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five [noise]", "show_name": "Mornings on the Mall (WMAL)", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "13"}
