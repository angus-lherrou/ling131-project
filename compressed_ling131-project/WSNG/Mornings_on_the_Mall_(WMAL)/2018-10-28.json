ever imagine support our immune system like nothing else can\nTurn up our heart muscles in leg muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch for two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor forty on vitamin D\nHe's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the top accused demand the media increasingly turns to for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years and medicine\nDoctor canal has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only your door says ... advance vitamin D formula he's put his name on it joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thing now doctors now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the past\nYear or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started and the impact is going to be unprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it would give them information about how the people about ... years ago\nIt's really going on here well let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it'll give some information about how this evolved\nAbout eight years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient\nWhen we followed our doctor's advice in our government's advice and we've started putting on the sun block and staying out of the sun it had a tremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood so I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant ... the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then ... within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coal factors it needs vitamin K to vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs ... and it needs magnesium they need to think and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it\nFor getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it or taking the wrong preparation\nCan learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\n... so what we're gonna talk about today as charities offer about a complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can buy in the store you can't buy it on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist together with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here because I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin industries Monday it'd be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with lie to Mindy\n... that's a good question let me just do one thing so people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered it and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off a list of headlines\nWhen you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamin Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nFor your PI or lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post\nA vitamin D deficiency called major health risk I Am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this vitamin D deficiency maybe the root of numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association new\nYou know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in\nProstate health rest health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pet it's not a vitamin it is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ...\nIt's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is a steroid hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid hormones and the way they work that is the key\n... there are key to your genetic code and some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it\nWell the first thing you'll notice there's a feeling in your wellbeing and you're just think clear but\nAs time goes on if you'll notice differences in your gums and teeth and if you ask anybody who's taking this product and has taken it for several months just ask them about their fingernail asked them what the change with the difference than your fingernail now these are things you can experience through the now\nGoing to say when does it do to your fingernails grow quicker\nThey become harder they become less riddle really shiny or it's really a remarkable change in your finger now but it takes more than a month because it takes about six months for the ... the girl I don't but these are things we can see and feel vitamin D. effects thirty six Oregon so why can't feel what it's doing and you're paying ...\nBut these are things we can see and feel vitamin D. effects thirty six Oregon so why can't feel what it's doing and you're paying for you\nKnow what it's doing for your blood pressure yeah you know or your prostate but we don't have time to talk about these thirty six Oregon's but what we're talking about is the immune system the pancreas the heart blood pressure\nMuscle spraying brain activity prostate health breast health colon health bone marrow teeth in gums kidney blown retina skin stomach\nUterus I mean I could go on but again because activated vitamin D is a steroid hormone it can affect all these organs because there's two thousand genes that it is the key to those genes and it depends upon which Oregon it is\nAnd which gene is involved so there's two thousand mechanisms of action that's very important to understand because you know we've been jaded with vitamin claims vitamin C. and vitamin either going to\nFeel better you're going to do this you're going to its cetera and so people find it hard to believe I mean the vitamin D only did one thing they find it easier to believe but they just have to remember the mechanism of action which is unique to any vitamin\nYou mentioned Colin health here in my family physician as a precautionary move will be on a pretty healthy dose of vitamin D what's the connection\nYou know what the reason you're gastroenterologist did that is because there's just a wealth of studies now that are coming out showing that coal and health and vitamin D levels are connected but had they're the same studies about breast tell the same studies about prostate health\nThis is like an insurance policy ... you're not to not to take this and it's it's free and\nAnd the other thing I Want to say as though you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this I was never told I mean five years from now and I don't want you to turn around and say I didn't know about I Wish I would've known because you've been polled at right now you're being told you know you can't say you never you never knew about it because I'm telling you right now it's involved\nFor example in a number of places in the country if you walk into the emergency room with anything that might be your heart you know what they do give you a hundred thousand units right off the bat first thing a hundred thousand years of vitamin D and then they keep giving\nThem and do you let me ask you a question speaking of the cardiovascular system and I know you could probably talk for about thirty minutes on this but some of the information you're sitting here just fascinating\nWhat vitamin D does talk about his role and maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system\nSame clues ... we know that heart health is that er the closer you live to the equator we know heart health is better in the summer than the winter but just recently there have been a slew of studies out of the best universities in the world all connecting\nYour vitamin D level to your heart healthy ... there's a study for example out of Harvard by a friend of mine professor Edward given ichi and his conclusion was pretty stark here it is quote a low levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated man\nEven after controlling for known risk factor that is\nEven after they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that there was the wrong effect of vitamin D\nAnd it was integrated manner that is if you're really deficient then your risk is much higher if you're a little deficient than your risk is a little higher and we don't have enough studies yet to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D although many cardiologist are prescribing it just on the basis of why not\nIt is safe you know five thousand units a day it cannot make anybody toxic five thousand units a day is ten minutes a summer show even five minutes of summers gun shy so the way these doctors are thinking is look\n... what the risk versus what's the benefit it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficient we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be unethical\nTo let people remain vitamin D deficient ...\nWhile we're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health or immune system\nIt would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficiency the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if your level thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most of them at best\nHave four hundred I use but I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself as a stand alone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand or you tablets but again that falls far short of that five thousand number and that's what you get was purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university the shows that when you ...\nI've ... number and that's what you get with purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at Creighton University that shows that when you get your level to fifty\n... ... your body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors used to store ... so if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it\nFor all the things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring with a pool at the top\nRight the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone\nAnd we've taken enough vitamin D to halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below it\nThe breath pool the colon pool the immune system poll all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D the upper pull\nOver flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pool\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for a rainy day\nAnd a little bit of a surplus yeah but you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty ... if you're levels less than around fifty ... you used up almost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation as well and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction\nWith their omega three fish oil the free bottled fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies and all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat is the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight ... to zero\nNow Dr can now talk to me about the link between vitamin D and body weight what's the research showing\nWell there's maybe fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D\nThe more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ... but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect but there were clues think lose that we know about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the quit people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience as people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were closed\nBut we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year they studied women who were dieting ...\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women really had the lower vitamin D and take yes and then\nJust a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people and they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is\nBut the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who are not take while at a Monday so that's another reason plots\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the official ... you know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reasons to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic he won't just stop eating\nPart of that that is you just feel better you're more active you're under doing something\nNow don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe is so vitally important did they give this formula ...\nWell ... ... we've had time to talk about the hard body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health coal in health breast health prostate health pancreatic health bone health the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that\nPeople will continue to take this if he just give it a try for a month is how you steal your get up and go you're feeling of wellbeing that's what you noticed now if you take it for several months or a year you'll notice a lot of different changes in your doctor will notice a lot of different changes in your dentist will notice a lot of different changes\nOkay well first of all I think well people might not know the term Kirk human they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows\nI think a lot of people might not know the term Kirk human they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in ...\nIt's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied is this\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined tell so if people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective it helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol\nAnd one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven primes\nThe absorption of any other ... human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up you\nKnow I Know that we turned over to you by the green tea in the current human in your new green tea yarn liquid soft your formula which purity is given away for free today but first tell me about the third\nNutrient on the list the risk ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines and the science behind was very ... I Know some red wine and\nThe French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just said to shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like\nGreen tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue\nInsulin insensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French\nDrink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but was there a trial appears to be\nKey in that and additionally there is a brain benefit\nLike there is with the current cumin with blood flow to the brain so when you take Reza there a trial you get rain blood flow this means who get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp\nAnd focused so this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that we are just plain take too long to explain\n... and again we're talking with Chris killing all he needed the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Christmas laser in on how this wonderful formula you created in conjunction with Judy ...

R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first what does this we are seeing foreign second you designed this formula\nIn a liquid soft you why do you like the liquid soft shelled technology so much\n... okay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and risk their a troll the big three ingredients that are in this product in meaningful protective amounts the recent that it's in a liquid soft shell is\nAll the big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amount the reason that it's in a liquid soft shell is that\nThat allows for rapid end very complete absorption I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell you just happen to get\nMore quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines\nThat means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients and the supplements so Greenpeace ER is green tea Kirk human interest there a trial and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for the three particular ingredient\n... now of course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary\nBottle of green tea see are telling me this you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B.

what I'm Talking about so if we're talking about financial freedom ... yes All right and I say well you know what kind of activities would surround the financial freedom now for me\nIn the big one is is that you do research and you you know kind of look at your options and so forth and so on those are actual activities right\nWell sure an activity now I think something that would be really important upon for teachers to be consistent you know no matter when you start and I'm sure you've got some at some hints regarding that as well uh no no I don't have any\nOh no [laughter] well you know you said All right you've got the windows of opportunity say open and close as you say that and it's interesting because we have these companies that we work with even they open up windows of opportunity and then they closed them and they're moving faster than ever I mean we things they say how things come across our deck as financial advisors and and\nSo it does have that safety factor in place and then finally it gives you a very very respectable rate of return\nThe average rate of return of the rash strategy has been about seven point two percent we can show you that\nWe can show you the numbers or five years ten years Fifteen Years\nTwenty five years I don't care how far you want to look back it's always the same average it's about seven percent tax free a year so that's why we're so passionate about it that's why a radio program now has gone coast to coast though we are talking about the rash strategy we've been talking about it for Fifteen Years\nWe've helped literally tens of thousands of people\nTo plug into the strategy across the country and we want to provide the information to you today so just pick up the phone give us a call a or a text message it's so simple to do you can you just give us your name your ZIP Code and your email address so we can start the process\nOf getting that information over to you the number to call or text as one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans sold sex and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five calls or provide your name female and the ... eight six six five four four Seventy seven ... said you\nKnow some people call and they said the wrath strategy what do you say rats\nWhat's it mean well it's R. A. S. T. retirement approach free attacks well is that the same as a ...\nWell it has some of the benefits ... but it actually has additional benefits as well so that's why you know it's different and it's better and its special and we have it ourself we eat our own clicking and you have to ask yourself how does this pertain to me\nAnd we had a gal and call us this week that said she's about ready to retire and she says you know what\nI've got way too much money in my T S P accounts I mean I have yet that's all I find it and it's I thought you know seven hundred thousand dollars in there and I'm concerned that my taxes are going to be higher when I retire then even when I've been working because I have no tax deductions on now she says they want to start moving some of that money into the raft prodigy\nA at even now she said she wanted to start and so an age sixty four started putting Iraq about eight thousand dollars a year you know not a huge amount but a thousand dollars a year and she wants to find that for the next ten years and guess what\nShe's able to then take out of a over nine thousand dollars a year so she's taking out more than what she's putting in but she's taking it out tax free and not only that\nHer family has been a death benefit that's attached to that South anytime along the way she passes away they're going to get an additional hundred and twenty five thousand a hundred and fifty thousand depending on how much he's put into the account that fire so it works really for any age\nShe finds that for for ten years but then she was able to take the money out for as long as she lives ... and then one of the great things about the rest strategy is that no matter how long you live I you know every little a hundred and five\nThey're still going to be a death benefit that death benefit typically is more than your initial investment that you put in and so if you put in\nA a thousand dollars a year for ten years eighty thousand dollars I can tell you no matter what age that you actually a pass away the death benefit to your beneficial is going to be more than your deposit of eighty thousand dollars and that's going to go tax free to your uh beneficiary whether that be your spouse or\nOr your children or whomever you name\nA show in multi purpose is your money around and that's one of the great things about the rest strategy that's why we are to get on to\nBill during or whomever you name a show in multi purpose is your money ... and that's one of the great things about the rest strategy that's why we are on the radio here and we talk about it every week because we just haven't found anything different or\nBetter out there uh to really help people to come around out their portfolio in such a way that they're providing multiple income streams I mean when you do\nA retired you do want to have a number of legs to your retirements could stool and an raff certainly should be a or could be one of those like so we want to get you

listeners that the rats tragic isn't something weird or strains that David ... created we did not design this concept this is something that rich people have used for years and years and years and yet now with especially over the past Fifteen Years it's packaged such that the everyday person can really engage in it\nAnd yet it goes by iris guidelines that have been that had been around since the Nineteen eighties half are different camera camera they actually govern how this actually works with your retirement planning\nAnd so it's an exciting concept that we engage in ourselves all of our children have raft accounts and we're glad for them because we know that they're going to be set for the future\nWell you know reading the book you reference of [noise] of course my wife by the way is on the acronym queen okay she ended up with raft and the triple the program and all the acronyms that we use but one of the things that I really liked that you use in the book and\nAnd from time to time here on the program the red is pom pom right now my wife is a former cheerleader so I guess pom pom was a natural thing to\nBut for pom pom standing for plenty of money peace of mind\nAnd I really didn't appreciate that until I read an article recently uh about as a survey that highlighted some important information for employers okay because\nThey did a recent survey and they found that uh people that lose sleep a ... from time to time over something that they're worried about six Seventy seven percent of them are worrying about ...\nMind money right\nRight so can you imagine that\nA third about forty nine percent of baby boomers are younger boomers ages fifty four to sixty three I'm admit to\nThat money was keep them awake ah and ah so Eighteen percent of all survey responded to admit\nTo being wake full in the wee hours about saving for retirement so not just money where he is not about how I'm going to make the bills necessarily but also about my future and a research has found that people that lose sleep are more prone to depression and anxiety so\nThe ultimate a bottom line here is that it's actually been tied to a higher degree of risk\nSo when you have your future when you have to you a pom\nPlenty of money peace of mind you're able to sleep better you're able to live a better quality of life and certainly that typically will involve having a in place multiple
