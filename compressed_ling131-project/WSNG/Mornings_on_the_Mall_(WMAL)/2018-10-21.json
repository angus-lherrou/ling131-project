I Know you know\nShe's added again okay Suzie Orman birth the Internet earlier this month when she\nTold a in her pod cast\nIt's called the forward anything part gas that she knows that people buying into the FIRE movement that's financial independence retire early she's also an acronym ah clean like you have a a a must save at least five million dollars okay simpler much eve that\nGoal okay now emails poured in tweets storms rage\nWe're going to get a zero I mean we're not going to make money in a downturn market but we're not going to lose money and a downturn market and sip and since most of the strategies that we employ a do not have ... uh you are actually going to stay completely even no one's going to the doctor or anything even if the market goes up or down\nWell and here's the thing to not super important or is that when we the principal protection sometimes people go back in the annals of their mind and they say personal protection does that mean that I'm just not going to lose the money that I put into it\nWell yeah but it's more than that\nIt's you're not going to lose the interest also that you the crew to within the account so we're not going all the way back to let you say about a hundred thousand dollars in their in ten years from now there's a huge downturn we're not going to bring you all the way back to a hundred thousand dollars if every single year that she got an a positive increasing that account that is also locked in and that becomes your new principal\nOur lab have I gone into the annals of my mind lately I am not familiar with that [laughter] that's what I mean it's like the libraries come on just look it up [laughter] wow okay let's\nSay you know what I read I Am inspired right now I think it's time for us okay to do the book reports\nInside David and Laura [noise] die for the\nEver searching the handles on my mind and I've come up with a father I thought you know it's it's kinda funny 'cause all you know many times we have bugs that are related to our personal circumstances and you know things that happen to us or maybe during the week or the previous week or whatever\nBut I was thinking today I'm I'm really not being bugged right now by too many things in my personal life but\nI Am bugged when people say to me\nThat when they retire they're going to spend less money okay I Am bug by that and I know that's not true because ... you and I are experiencing that 'cause we are semi retired I mean we still do what we love but\nAh but you know for the most part I mean we are semi retired we've delegated a lot of our practice out to a you know our our children are are are we know we do have a family business and certainly all of the advisors that plug into it so we've got\nA a system that's really kind of on cruise control for the most part but one thing that I hadn't really noticed is that my expenses have not gone down as a fact retirement may be much much more costly than you think and I'll just you know mentioned a few things that from my own personal experience\nThat has caused this number number one I think people don't factor in big ticket items I mean when they look at their budget and they say well I've got my needs taken care of I understand that\nAnd that's really obviously a very very important thing but how about your once okay and you have your wants taken care of I mean don't overlook a big ticket items like a on a new car that you might need or want or a repairs to your home which ... you get more and more expensive\nUh and certainly things that you know maybe we don't budget for and so big ticket items are one of the things that are really you'd you know a lot of people don't consider\nAlso changing spending habits are right now in our personal experience I found what can I here's my thought process what can I buy now that I deserve okay or that I didn't have when I was you know working full time that I didn't even have time to enjoy\nOr a you know the money to to use a for that particular project\nI have an idea okay\nA boat above that yes the idea that I Am by about yes the ... and in addition to those vacation okay rabble\nThat we love to do\nIt's an eye on by about a fair yes the ... and in addition to those vacation okay\nRabble that we love to do you know hobbies I mean I guess I could put my boat as ... as a hobby but these things you know cost a lot of money All right and so you don't consider these things about lending money to kids Laura okay that's another one now we have learned not to try to do that but the the uh we are guilty about ourselves\nOr spoiling grandkids that's when I can say that's a that's a ... that's ... that's a great invest yeah that's why\nI I Want to spoil even in our parents case though I mean look at my mom for example she just turned eighty years old and she has talked ever since I can remember and play with six years old she has talked about taking a trip to the holy land okay you know and this is like\nHow many years at ... you know Seventy ... some odd years later she's still talking about it I said mom now is the time we actually are just selling the house that we bond with her together and working and now have the money that you know for her to do that and but it's just an example we don't\nBut we don't have to a company that's like ... are there for [laughter] I don't get free ... and really what we already thousand dollar dress up and we just did it like two years ago so I mean we're not going to go back there again like next year\nOkay and they know the point maybe in a ...\nOkay how about the uh let's get back on task okay how about fees that's another one we don't consider and the big one ... the big one that people just don't consider our taxes okay and we think these are we as we look at our IRAs and her four oh one K. is in her for all three ... and we say well jeeze I've got you know\nThree hundred thousand dollars in there well guess what all ... all taxable so you know maybe twenty five or even thirty percent of that is not your money that's money that has to be\nThat go towards the the Texas and do these are things that we consider and that's why the rash strategy the red is such a great alternative to an IRA or four one K. you talk about the raft strategies and retirement approach ... attacks\nIn the book I Want you to kind of had some of the highlights of that but before you do we want to make sure and get a copy of the raft strategy in your hands along with brochures and booklets and\nAnd I'm the most important thing of course is the illustration that we provide for you that will show you how these work why they work maybe while your financial advisor hasn't told you about um there's a lot of consideration or give us a call or text us at one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans call or text and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five calls or to provide your name female ends of ... a six six five four four Seventy seven\nOkay Dave so another point on the back of this book it says use IRS rules to make Uncle Sam your partner or not you're so okay so what would that mean I mean to me we're not all that happy sometimes is higher as simply because we have to keep on paying taxes and well we\nWe filed orderly so we have to write a check for always running check for the IRS\nRight but there are some parts that were ecstatic about knowing that we have made Uncle Sam my partner and how did we do that\nWhen we did it through our own rap strategy yeah they we we employ some of the the you know we do eat our own cooking we have a ... three three rats strategy accounts right now that are going to provide and we still haven't even taken income from them\nOr at this time but certainly the you know part of the plan is is that we are going to start taking tax free income from those in the next few years\nAnd that will provide you know a lot of uh a benefit here not only a living benefit which we received but it also provides step on the face in addition to\nSo it's not something we're to strains that David ... created and come up with some idea it's just like the ... has been around for a while to even tougher different camera yeah there you go and do their tax relief act from the Nineteen eighty okay\nBut here's the thing this is not an old school system\nWhen some people say oh yeah I Know about that I learned about that in the nineties it was not the same because there are some uh vehicles that has changed dramatically simply because of the way that we have principled protection now where that didn't exist in the nineties and there's all different ways that they the companies do they're infecting which is different than what they did back then\nSo there's a lot of competition and also in the army now there's a number of companies that are ... double a company's triple ... that have been around for ever and ever like over a hundred years and they have come up with\nA version of the raft strategy and so we're constantly bird talking and find out hey what does the bats account for this particular person for their age group and so forth and we can get that information your hand specifically in the form of an illustration that takes into account your life your lifestyle the

boomers retiring tomorrow [noise]\nOnly a few tornadoes are gearing will know why it was Ninety five percent of Americans have received in during the war years were there were three percent to say why\nDoesn't it just make you want to take out a reverse mortgage we're in\nA you know I Love that guy's voice that Tom Selleck man and he's just got the coolest raspy voice I Would love to hear him sing a song sometime I mean he's ... he's got a sound like ... Clinton on steroids I mean it just so cool the way his voice is\nAh and ah he looks so good to you know like this looks good\nBut yeah he's a good point and that you know we have so many people that are retiring every single day ten thousand people a day the rats\nAnd then thirdly if I get sick or ill there's certain provisions within the account itself that can provide for me like if I you know heaven forbid terminal illness pops up\nAnd guess what you're calling the company saying you know what my doctor said that they're saying OK well cut you a check you can you use your death benefit before you actually passed away so there's all these different features and benefits that you don't have with regular accounts or even\nA you know someone who these little provide some of that but but this is not an annuity different it's a tax\nFree account that created without her and companies that have been around for years and years and are of\nCourse on ... all ... all but the rest Reggie is tax free up properly designed properly funded equity indexed contract with them in church repositories so linked to an equity indexed so you get the upside of the market\nBut you're protected on the outside law says it's liquid so important that this is liquid literate so that you can access the money anytime it didn't have to be over the age of fifty nine and a half years old it is safe meaning that you'll never lose your money you'll never lose your principal you'll never lose your interest\nAnd it gives you a great rate of return it's averaged over seven percent per year though you might say well seven percent is good yeah but how about seven percent tax\nFree that is fabulous right so we want to get you the book it should the illustrations and get your questions answered and it's so simple to start that process when you do contact us when you reach out you're going to go to a voice mail system the sleeve is your name your email address so we can email us some information over to you\nAnd your ZIP Code we want to know what state in which you live so that we can provide the information based on the laws of your state so ah give us a call or text us at one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty four hours\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans call or text and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five\nCalls or to provide your name female ends of ... a six five four four Seventy seven\nWe mentioned all the time that we eat our own cooking and we have our own accounts and we have a couple of wrath strategy going on our own behalf but\nWe don't mention a whole lot that each one of our children also have to do\nAnd in fact uh are are one of our oldest son's Tanner who works with that's directly in our business here he called me yesterday says you know my wife is adamant that I get her own raft strategy started because you know he thought his and then she says and and not only that we want one on each of the children as well so\nHe's got he's got a little project ahead of me because I've got to know create all of these accounts for each of the children as well now why in the world would he want to do that tell in law got\nHer so I mean you know certainly uh uh well I Know why his wife wants to bring you know she's she wants her own security I mean she's a very independent person and let's just say that to enter a you know died okay yes she would get a ballooning benefit from his has been a Fisher\nPerson and let's just say that Tanner or you know died okay yes she would get a ballooning benefit from his goes beneficiary\nBut she wants to have her own lifetime income right and not only yeah and only the lifetime income can only go to the person that actually owns the account so from that perspective I think that um\nAh that that's probably some of her reasoning and then the children I mean certainly for college education that are coming up around the corner and the beauty of the rash strategy is is that it can be utilized she can access at the child can access that\nTax free uh to supplement or to altogether pay for a they're continuing education after they graduate from high school I think\n... I mean it's just a foundational part as anybody is a financial planning\nI you know any other things that our children are doing that I'm really proud of is that they are educating their shoulder and\nAh and I think that this is such an important thing to do educating them in the area of finances and they're beginning that process early and often and these are things that are so important for us to do a because you know our children don't get to education and in\nIn school and they don't they don't receive it so anyway get the book at the illustration and get started get your questions answered the number to call or text us one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap strategy savings plans scholarships and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five ... ... email ... a sixty five four four Seventy seven ... so I think it's time for this style\nJob [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nUm\nHe ... down and bring that back you know I\nThe Tonight Show it's just not the same sorry about that but you know it was this month in October of Nineteen sixty two the Johnny Carson took over from Jack Parr as the host of data late night talk program the Tonight Show\nAnd Carson went on to host the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson for three decades becoming one of the biggest figures in entertainment in the twentieth century\nThere wasn't a person in America there still isn't that hasn't seen or heard of Johnny Carson and absolutely amazing entertainer who feel their house with laughs\nAnd wondered night after night after night it was just such a pleasure to watch them work Thirty years of consistent quality programming from Johnny Carson if only the red our retirement plans could deliver such lengths inconsistency well you know why I think they hand\nAnd the the raft strategy [laughter] I\nWish I could talk like I had been banned but yeah so the rest strategy ... you know the retirement approach free of tax I mean are we been talking about this on the radio now for Fifteen Years\nSo you know what entice me when I first started my first one and it says like ten years ago okay that I started my first draft account is I\nI I actually did the numbers and I realized that if I were to put aside fifty thousand a year for five years that two hundred fifty thousand dollars right and then wait another five years to start you know before I start taking distributions\nUh I was actually able to take out around forty thousand dollars per year but if I wait another five years after that it's actually more about Seventy five thousand dollars per year okay forget the magic words\nEvery year tax retired ... some Seventy five thousand so this is why did it I like I said he knows that because I Want Seventy five thousand dollars a year coming to me tax free because I feel like when I'm sixty five years old that's going to be it's going to go a long way towards getting everything I Need to meet my daily NATO or\nYou know it's so interesting how we actually got into this business for ... years ago I had I\nI at the time I owned a mortgage company and of course like many a mortgage brokers and uh you know folks that were in that business we were helping people to access equity of their homes to be on a there was so much equity going on in the end of the real estate boom was going\nStrong and there was all these creative financing tools uh that uh you know eventually actually caused the collapse of of a lot of ...\nAnd I have to buy all you not to interrupt but here's the thing I remember you coming home at night insane and this is actually written the book ... I'm not feeling great about these mortgages I think that there's gonna be how to be paid I years later\nSo you're in the book ... I'm not feeling great about these mortgages I think that there's gonna be how to be paid I years later when if what if what if something happens in the market and you called it why I was ready for it\nI think that anyone who was in the business at that time probably unless they were really not engaged in what was going on they were probably suspicious of how this would all turn out\nAnd certainly the federal government should have a better where of that but they weren't so or at least they didn't appear to be\nA bottom line is is that as we access that people would turn to us at the at the table and say you know what do I do with this money and you know we didn't think that it was prudent at that time to invest that money and the stock market\nUh because obviously home equity is sacred I mean that's that's something that you ever want to lose your polling that money out of it you have to create arbitrage with the money in order to make it work because obviously there's a cost\nTo accessing that home equity money and ah I read a book at that time by an author called dog by the name of Doug ... out in Salt Lake City is called\nA missed fortune and you know when I read that book I was like wow this is amazing this whole strategy that he's come up with\nAnd so we basically uh you know plugged into a lot of what he did and then of course we uh uh brought into it our own spin on on a number of things and we created the rats strategy\nA and so now we were as we excess equity we could sell the top people will put here because this money is safe it's liquid and it'll give you a great tax free rate of return and that's sort of how our practice was warm and\nThen after a short period of time we decided well you know it's probably\nIn our best interest and everybody else that we're working with and not in the mortgage is I mean we're not feeling good about those mortgages let's just help people utilize maybe funds that they have outside of their home equity perhaps it's the banker savings or you know or maybe even money that you would normally spend on on other things to\nAccess that and put it into the rest strategy and that's our practice\nRight for them and what was so remarkable is during the thoughts an age when we had a number of people had had already engaged in the wrath strategy we got so many causing so many letter saying thank you thank you for you know helping us to take our money and set it aside so that it's in a safe place even", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mornings on the Mall (WMAL)", "city": "Torrington", "day": "21"}
