have for rental gotta pay for and he came home last earlier that same during one about the other one [noise] but um we mortgage and this one when we're in a proper markets and we have a construction on now\nAnd we are in the process of turning it into a regular market but I just have a bad feeling about it and I'm thinking about it and wait until we can get another one without mortgage I just don't feel good about it\nAnd got\nMy he he wants to go and have done that you know you know I'm a property manager\nHe said it's up to you yeah buddy bought or without talking to you oh\nNo no he bought it we agreed on mine I mean it together and okay\nSo you're agreed on the purchase and now you're thinking you don't want the debt\nExactly where the rent is twelve hundred and don't know if we turned into markets will be four hundred and something\nMhm show how much will you owe on the property\nWe were only nine to ... and\nThen you have a four hundred dollar mortgage\nA four fifty seven

[laughter] well we have um\nNo not really\n...\nOkay I'm In I assume you can sell it and make money on it it sounds like right now or ...\nYeah we can we took money up front but they on debt is um\nAnd now we could probably make about ten to Fifteen rally outright but you know when we do it in that and we can make that and you know two or three years with collecting rent but not really because we would have a mortgage on it about ... of its going back and forth\nYou know show what ... did you pay off\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're with us and Chuck is on the line and ... for\nA job welcome Ramsey\nThe second call sure once [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you and what we've only got about two hundred new things about what to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental property but we\nHave mortgages on and and those two and a half years we've had a ... graduate high school he's little college we've been paying\nAbout half the tuition all he's been taking out loans the other half and I and I stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I've got a beginner babies to say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm not doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand to soak in the two of you you and him a cash flow the scoop and stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental properties as we've been for the past couple of years\nIf you um I mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather put get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason that plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college tutor in the next few years\nAnd you will ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement fathers kids' college which urine or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really I'm a you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nWhich is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of are considered that we should just have a a a three three maybe four month emergency five and then\nAnd then and then I stopped taking on student loans and clear them out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids\nIf there is money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn her house is tiny but then and then there how's your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay\nA fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for one is the only ones only twenty five I was in a write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good but then my son is still alive and take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right\nAh yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimums and take your college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's a pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about first we're getting back in the world when Kay or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no soon as you get your emergency fund right yeah and an emergency fund is maybe step three and then maybe step forwards Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nThen we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house that's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order to actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order\nRight but it's not like it was about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent\nWere taking care of college and then if there is money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages doctrine is that so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneous is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skipping three or two and three I guess technically\nYou're skipping five or ... yeah yeah yeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're on our lawyers\nWe want you back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi nice to meet him the it's an honor to talk to you how can I ask them for you [laughter] okay um we had our house currently on the market\nRight now the list today in July for two teams [noise] um I Know there's not enough in our area [noise] um we did it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise] we've had\nI mean we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what were struggling with here that we paid one half day for the house the average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then ... and set out to the Haitian because it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYeah so you're not in our in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast\nYesterday a near up near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nThe dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in Maine and all that says is you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what\nTo do your other than a is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that usually there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurt the things\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it looks gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't I Can't do it anymore you know\nA kid you know\nWe're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say\nOh well I don't I don't think prices your problem or a or you got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at they're looking at it on line all there\nIs workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through them in the ... where it was I walked away\nThere were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his own for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer for males to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another well\nYes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get your dues go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe\nAt under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the\nPerson that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers and it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nAnd they and they don't have potential buyers for it and you need it it's a very unique [noise] semi rural ... situation\nSorry this is that I Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ...\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was you know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and uh\nOh I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... they don't have a voice from the beginning so I mean I'm\n... with your own income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the ...\nWhich really only wired it was really difficult to to give up something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that but it also kind of oil down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show then and then we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's a beach with the legs that kind of stuff with the income you've got and no debt\nYou can do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean as you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses ourselves right man it's um you know you are your freed up to I still have incredible um\nFamily memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say an interesting very\nInteresting so um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the doubt so our our whole debt is um [noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off we were able to pay off the home that we live in ...\nAnd so we we use the cash derived from that\nPlus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just three property ... yeah that's what I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which everyone operates okay ... ... worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations oil and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation too yeah cause that's secure then amazing\nAbsolutely amazing so you're sitting there with a net worth Whelan exposure to a million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with this income you got to be loading up\nSo um\nHow she feels\nFeels great I mean I'm you know I'm I'm\nI'm kinda to the point of a second guess and even even having so much of our network tied up in a house ... um so but it feels great ... you know it's it's a it's a first step in a journey yeah yeah\nWell I get give yourself a couple three years to think on that one you know where to go you're in great shape don't worry about because your net worth is going to continue to grow and the house is going to continue to grow because of your income ratios to me it's just incredible you'll be able to do whatever you want to do so

different solutions that we can provide to our clients and\nI really struck me that you know whether it's because we're ... we're talking about how sometimes they'll meet with people and\nAnd the guy's like oh you know we you know I just want to risk my money and just keep it in the stock market are or what have you and\nIt because they're being brave right and the the gals or sometimes like well you know maybe we should take some chips off the table how the principal protection and and then get to a great rate of return is well they're talking about\nAnd I I think sometimes we think that it's brave to put you keep your money all in the market and yet here's the thing you can have the best of both worlds it was funny one of the bigger thing you know it's like\nGoldie locks okay and he

yourself has your financial advisor talk to you about the rash strategy do you think that maybe you would want to\nDo your own due diligence I mean you know what we found in our own personal lives and and certainly it through other many clients that we have I mean we have over two thousand personal clients were at night I and of course we have thirty about thirty five advisors now that work or in our system across the country and they all have their clients\nAnd what we found is that nobody you know and then we also we often tell this dark like nobody cares more about your money and you do okay you might have a financial advisor but he doesn't care about your money more than you do or she doesn't care about your money more than you do [noise]\nSo it's always really important to have

want to talk about the agility Seventy five now if you have an irate four one K. for all three B. T. S. P. plan that would not normally be money that you would put into the raft strategy right money that you put in the restaurant uh jeeze outside of those qualified plans although you can you know take distributions and put them into the raft I mean that's a whole other\nConversation that may or may not be a advisable or however uh if you do have an irate four one K. for all three D. you're going to want to listen to us especially a a ... in the second half are going to talk a lot about what we called the agility Seventy five I write this is an amazing I count\nThat uh we are really now promoting because you know we always try to bird dogs arrive and find out what the best\nAccounts or write a lot of competition in this industry and so different companies come up with different strategies and they're always trying to wind up each other and and I got to tell you I I did count that we're seeing now our way better than they were you know Fifteen Years ago when we are to that I mean we\nWe've coined if you if you're in Washington DC and you you know you think the ten ten I write well that statement Loretta okay we we really brought that we brought that account to to Washington DC and we've got hundreds and hundreds of people in the DC area that have\nPlugged into the ten ten irate than we brought in this thirty percent match IRA when that was a a limited time a a really opportunity okay and there was a special promotion going on by a wonderful company we brought it to DC\nUh we talked about on the airways ... talked about it a lot we got a lot of people interested into an incredible account well you know now we're going to talk about the agility Seventy five because you know as we look out there\nWho said well what's the best thing we can talk about okay and then it really depends on your objective right so if your objective is a accumulation well that may not be the agility Seventy five that may be another account if your account\nPay some Seventy five percent at six percent it's four point five and now what we're doing is they're adding the four point five percent on top of the six to ... parents that's ten point five so we\nGet ten point five members return that year for honor in coming out so we got to hunt now these two that that match and this additional\nA return that we receive every year are going to work hand in hand with one another\nTo kind of benefits work hand in hand with one another so now we're going to get ten point five percent in that particular\nSo right the first year here we got we got a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars plus in um ... and five percent so corrupt that hundred and thirty five [laughter] and already just after\nThat and the first year in that exam run and of course you know ... if you have a negative here in this in the index that you choose 'cause why you don't lose any money right so you have that\nFlora zero no matter what he ... you'd never going to lose money in the account well how long would that hundred and Seventy five percent go on for do you think\nWell I Know the answer is actually forever\nAnd tell me about it that way\nOf which is awesome as good that you know so yes you're right [laughter] okay yeah it's not like a lot of you know it was only five yeah right\nBut it's amazing to be OK so this is going to continue this hundred and Seventy five percent what we call it participation rate\nFor as long as you have the account open which hopefully will be for until the day you die right so you will receive\nA hundred and Seventy five percent of indexed returns\nYear after year after year after year after year\nAnd now let's just say we start taking income on the account and we start with an income amount and that continues\nTo get in grow ... each year at a hundred and Seventy five percent of the index returns let me give you an example okay and I have a illustration here that I prepared perfect right so I'm just trying\nTo maintain and it's like he's going to start out at a certain amount of income and that's going to be on the base but then every year that there is an increase in the marketing your allocation cast what your income is going to increase\nRight so you know very simple okay I'm going to just say I'm fifty five years old and I wish I still was\nFifty five years old and I have a hundred thousand dollars All right and I'm In a role that hundred thousand dollars into the agility Seventy five Iran might come from my money you know another IRA I have er a a four O. one K. from a previous employer or what ever right\nAnd now I'm going to actually let that money just kind of sit there for let's say ten years no trial and allow I retire probably compound right and so now you know I'm going to do what it's doing and this was based on historical rate of return okay that it's been doing\nWith the criteria that we just talked about and now it's sixty five years old okay ten years later I'm going to turn on the income okay so my account is gone grown would you believe\n[laughter] excuse me I have a cold side um coffee a little bit I Apologize but now I'm a site it okay so about this\nSo from a hundred thousand now it's worth three hundred and eleven thousand dollars or a ... pretty sweet [noise] I'm starting come on the ... my first years income okay is going to be Fifteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety six dollars no wait a minute I'll arrive\nAllow you just put a hundred thousand dollars in there when you started your incomes over Fifteen thousand dollars which would be Fifteen Percent yeah that's yeah credible\nSo think about that that the withdrawal rate\nBut that's just where it starts okay so every year that the index has a positive return I'm going to get a my income is going to go up so in the second year of my income goes up to Eighteen thousand three eighty\n... about that and the four in the in the fourth year\nRight my income now Twenty one thousand two hundred and fifty two\nIn the sixth year my incomes twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars a year so I've gone in six years from Fifteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety six dollars to now twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars and that income continues to grow\nAnd it's going to continue to provide these benefits and its income I cannot outlive ... let me give you a shocker ... I started income at sixty six\nRight now I'm eighty five mhm okay my income is sixty seven thousand eight hundred and Ninety six salary and\nYou can eat that's really even outpacing inflation oh way way higher which I don't think it has that\nLincoln Senate you how to when you when you retire it's like okay well what is going to happen with inflation I might go into well how can I can I buy the same amount of stuff now with the same money that I have or do I am I getting more money and\nYou say well here's a here's the thing where I ... I put it in a hundred thousand dollars by the time I'm eighty five years old I've taken out seven hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars huh okay\nIf this sounds like something you'd like to learn about you got to give us a call okay and we'll get your your own illustration I'm going to talk about another illustration and the second and that was a fifty five year old how about if I started sixty the numbers look a little even better a but let me get you a ...\nDid the illustration get to the brochures get your question to answer and by the way that I tell that I say the magic words\nI didn't know\nYou know those are nearly okay they'll seize right so give us a call ... give us a tax ... just get the information okay the number to call or text as one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free raft strategy savings plans call or text and your name's email and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five calls or\nProvide your name female ends it feels a sixty five foot four Seventy seven fifty five will say\nThat's an amazing I can honestly this is something that ... and actually just come on to the offering so we didn't have this uh ... four months ago a this is something new or\nWell it's not from a new company you know it's a\nTon of energy and enhanced account that tell you know has been around it in yet they've enhance it to the hundred and Seventy five percent\nPretty right and you know the companies are in a way to company than men in business over a hundred years I mean does this is ... you know we want to that's why we're so you know passionate about getting your questions answered on this\nI went over fifty five year old putting in sixty five or a hundred thousand dollars what I did here's just real quick I'm\nIf I'm sixty and I put that same hundred right mhm and now I start income at Seventy one which I Do you know I never thought that our allies or require a minimum data to start taking income\nRight so now rather than Fifteen thousand like it was if I had started at sixty six my income starts at Seventeen thousand four hundred and fifty five dollars a year and a hundred thousand rooms\nI and I didn't put it in till I was sick she so it's the same ten year period incomes higher because I'm a little bit older and that income continues to go up a you know proportionately I'd a hundred and Seventy five percent index returns I every time we get a positive beer in the index so\nOne of the need of truth to that says that if the IRA belongs to say the wife\nAnd a ... instead of course it's gonna be her IRA and yet it can last as long as the husband is well like if one were won a spouse or to ... the other than it would continue for that other spouse\nRight that's right so you're you're absolutely right so I was thinking the other way round because of the men you know don't ...
