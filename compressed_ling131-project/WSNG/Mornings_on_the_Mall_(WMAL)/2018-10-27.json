but let me give me an example of what I'm Talking about so if we're talking about financial freedom ... yes\nAll right and I say well you know what kind of activities would surround the financial freedom now for me\nYou know the the big one is is that you do research and you know kind of look at your options and so forth and so on those are actual activities right\nWell sure an activity now I think something that would be really important to plan for teachers to be consistent you know no matter when you start and I'm sure you've got some ethics and hence regarding that as well ah no no I don't have\nAny oh no [laughter] well you know you said All right you can join the windows of opportunity they open and then they close as you say that and it's interesting because we see these

seven point two percent we can show you that\nWe can show you the numbers over five years ten years Fifteen Years twenty five years I don't care how far you want to look back it's always the same average it's about seven percent tax free a year so that's why we're so passionate about it that's why a radio program now has gone\nCoast to coast though we are talking about the rash strategy we've been talking about it for Fifteen Years we've helped literally tens of thousands of people to plug into the strategy across the country\nThat strategy we've been talking about it for Fifteen Years

five five calls or\nProvide your name female and the ... eight six six five four four Seventy seven ... said you\nKnow some people call and they said the right strategy what are you saying rats\nWasn't mean well it's our eight ask tea retirement approach free attacks well is that the same as a Roth IRA\nWell it has some of the benefits of the Roth IRA but it actually has additional benefits as well so that's why you know it's different and it's better and its special and we have it ourself we eat our own cooking and you have to ask yourself how does this pertain to me ...\nAnd we had a gal and call us this week that said she's about ready to retire and she says you know what\nI've got way too much money in my T S P account I mean I have yet that's all I find it and it's I've got you know seven hundred thousand dollars in there and I'm concerned that my taxes are going to be higher when I retire then even when I've been working because I have no tax deductions on now she says they want to start moving some of that money into the strategy\nA at even now she said she wanted to start and so\nAn age sixty four started putting Iraq about eight thousand dollars a year you know not a huge amount but a thousand dollars a year and she wants to find that for the next ten years and guess what\nShe's able to then take out of a over nine thousand dollars a year so she's taking out more than what she's putting in but she's taking it out tax free and not only that\nHer family has been a death benefit that's attached to that South anytime along the way she passes away they're going to get an additional hundred and twenty five thousand a hundred and fifty thousand depending on how much he's put into the account that sparks so it works really for any age\nSo she wanted for for ten years but then she's able to take the money out for as long as she ... and then one of the great things about the rest of the Jews that no matter how long you live I you know every two hundred and five\nThey're still going to be a death benefit that death benefit typically is more than your initial investment that you put in and so if you put in\nA a thousand dollars a year for ten years eighty thousand dollars I can tell you no matter what age that you actually a pass away the death benefit to your beneficial is going to be more than your deposited eighty thousand dollars and that's going to go tax free to your uh beneficiary whether that be your spouse or\nOr your children or whomever you name\nA show it multi purpose is your money ... and that's one of the great things about the rest strategy that's why we\nArgued on the radio here and we talk about it every week because we just haven't found anything different or better out there are two really help people to come around out their portfolio in such a way that they're providing multiple income streams I mean when you do\nA retired you do want to have a number of legs to your retirement screwed stool and an raff certainly should be a or could be one of those like so we want to get through the book ... information and get your questions answered\nThe number to call or text as one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free raft strategy savings plans call or text and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven five five or ten\n... name female and the ... a six five four four Seventy seven if I\nHave I wanted to remind listeners that the rats tragic isn't something weird or strains that David ... created we did not design this concept this is something that rich people have used for years and years and years and yet now with especially over the past Fifteen Years this package such that the everyday person can really engage in it\nAnd yet it goes by iris guidelines that have been that had been around since the Nineteen eighties ... hammer camera they actually govern how this actually works with your retirement planning\nAnd so it's an exciting concept that we engage in ourselves all of our children have raft accounts and we're glad for them because we know that they're going to be set for the future\nWell you know the reading the book you reference of course my wife by the way isn't the acronym queen okay she ended up with raft and the triple the program and all the acronyms that we use but one of the things that I really liked that you use in the book and\nAnd from time to time here on the program the red is pom pom right now my wife is a former cheerleader so I guess\nIs that I really liked that you're using the book and [noise] and from time to time here on the program the red is pom pom right now my wife is a former cheerleader so I guess pom pom was a natural going to budge for pom pom standing for plenty of money peace of mind\nAnd I really didn't appreciate that until I read an article recently uh about as a survey that highlighted a some important information for employers okay because\nThey did a recent survey and they found that uh people that lose sleep of from time to time over something that they're worried about six Seventy seven percent of them are worrying about ...\nMind money right\nRight so can you imagine that\nA third about forty nine percent of baby boomers are younger boomers ages fifty four sixty three I'm admit to\nThat money was keep them away uh and uh so Eighteen percent of all survey respond to submit\nTo being wake full in the wee hours about saving for retirement so not just money where he is not about how I'm gonna make the bills necessarily but also about my future and a research has found that people that lose sleep are more prone to depression and anxiety so\nThe ultimate a bottom line here is that it's actually been tied to a higher degree of risk\nSo when you have your future when you help you a pom\nPlenty of money peace of mind you're able to sleep better you're able to live a better quality of life and certainly that typically will involve having a in place multiple income streams when in fact you did retire\nThat's exactly right and and that's why we want to get information into your hands the number to call
