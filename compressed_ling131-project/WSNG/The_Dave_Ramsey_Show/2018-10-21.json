E. ratio that stands for the price\nDivided by the earnings ratio\nSo one method of valuing a stock or the stock market is to determine what the PE ratio the price earnings ratio is and then to compare that with\nHistorical norms and then also to compare that with some of the critical variables that have an impact on the PE ratio most especially things like inflation expectations and\nThat have an impact on the PE ratio most especially things like inflation expectations and interest rates\nSo when we take a look at the historical range of PE ratios as they would apply for example to the standard and Poor's five hundred index we see that over the very very long term the range has been quite wide for example\nSpecific company risk\nBut that was so if you had a stock we sell I this is a stock that uh I just have to own I Want to own as much of it that makes sense\nThen you could make a case for yourself of placing four percent up to up to four percent of your stock market portfolio in one company and that would be a an example of a company that would be the most attractive in your view\nOkay well thanks I had one of the question um I have a lot of stocks and my IRAs and I know that you think should be bombs and they are heroes should I sold them and put them in my non IRA part\nUm the does that make sense I mean if I saw where there's no there's no capital gains and I guess I can disagree by them and uh the other counts as a dessert a wise move\nWell I think that um here's the consideration there let's go back to the basics here why is it that investors benefit from having stocks in their personal money\nAnd bonds and their tax privileged money the answer is because the interest that you are in on a taxable bond\nIs subject to taxation in your case a lot of taxation in New York City right interests that you are in whereas if you put it in a tax privilege to count\nThen it's a it's not going to be that you're you're not going to get the pay income tax on taxable income because it's in the tax privilege to count whereas with your stocks when you have those in your personal account you get the benefit\nOf the law if you hold it for a long term you get the benefit of the long term capital gain rule which limits your tax ability somewhat although I have to say in your case in your case in the top bracket\nYou would be paying long term capital gains at the federal level including the healthcare taxed for who would be ... you'd also pay the state of New York in the city of New York so in your case your your tax bill and a personal account I could see it getting up probably in the vicinity of thirty percent\nRight [laughter]\nSo you see because you're in such a very very high tax area it's a you know probably less of a factor or here's the consideration though if you held it for a short term then you get married\nBecause you're going to pay the top rate if you're in the top bracket plus New York plus the city your way into the forties now to make it even worse for you to make it even worse for you you were losing the duck the ability of your New York state\nIncome tax your New York city income tax and you're in New York state sales tax and any property taxes above ten thousand dollars so New Yorkers are getting the shaft\nRight so in my case it really wouldn't make much difference that if I if I well\nThe cause of your very high tax bracket yeah it's not it's not a dramatic difference\nOkay and it's west question since the ... my I have a forty six the allocation of decided then ... years old it does that seem to many socks does that seem like too much to me is Fox\nYou have a forty percent equity allocation\nForty percent equity of\nYeah I think at that age I probably would not be troubled uh assuming you have a favorable market outlook I Would probably not be troubled by a ...\nI I could live with fifty fifty but I Know that people in the\nPast not what I that's not what it is not what I said David Oh thank you for ... let me thank you for calling or I Would be comfortable with the allegation that you have right now and I do appreciate the call us get out the Santa Fe New Mexico listening to the great K. K. O. B. radio Albuquerque Paul welcome to Monday talk\n[noise] hey Bob good afternoon and I\nAppreciate you listening for a long time and I know how you feel about the federal deficit and how\nIt has such a defect on the national debt and I would I I personally think that Republicans were very critical asking this tax cut because they have always been so critical of the opposition\nOr the lack of interest in the dad and now I think the public\nThey have always been so critical of the opposition\nUh for the lack of interest in the debt and now I think the Republicans have just been very hypocritical because the effects that this tax cut will have on the debt and I I just I Hope I Would like your your commentary on it\nAnd see if if you if you say the same thing that I Do a fake you bought a\nReal thank you Paul I must say I have not been hearing anything at all out of Washington DC\nFrom the GOP you about the annual deficit or the national debt I haven't been hearing anything at all it's basically been radio silence on the subject of the national debt and the annual deficit let's get Chris on the line in San Ramon Chris it's your turn\nHi, Bob thank you for taking my call good to have you with us\nThank you um my question basically is whether it's wise for media is a money manager I'm I'll tell you my situation I'm retired I have about two and a half million dollars a for investing and currently I have a lot of that in portfolio three\nI'm but I'm a little uneasy about putting all my money into that portfolio\nUm and it's just I don't know why exactly I think it's an emotional thing putting so much into having money um mutual funds so I recently met with a financial adviser and um she gave me a couple of points I was just wondering if if he would comment on them\nUm she of course thinks I should give that a manager and I'm One of the reasons why she said anyone with over five hundred thousand dollars\nA should be an individual stocks as opposed to mutual funds because of the fees involved the risk of over diversifying and\nThe inability to harvest losses harvest losses and maximize gains\nUm and I was just wondering if you had a comment on that course there's also the fees that they're going to charge which I think our little high at one point two five up to a million dollars but um ... aside from that um do you have any comment on her and the other reasoning that that she used\nWhen I think it's on a builder rated nonsense a let's take a point by point what's the first point you'd like to comment on\nHow well the face for mutual\nWell a ... a million dollars a one on a quarter that's twelve thousand five hundred dollars what are you going for twelve thousand five hundred dollars\nWhat are you getting a well and I guess the ability to move the money around faster um\nWhoa whoa whoa I I don't even know what that means if you if you have a portfolio for example of index funds you can as a general rule you can call up the ... family and move money at will on the telephone or even better do we go on line\nMany people do it on line so I don't even know what that means moving money around faster and has no meaning particularly\nPointed out that it takes a day to you know they do and if you get the prize at the end of the day when you saw mutual find as opposed to the ...\nMeter ... are are are they suggesting or they suggesting this is incredible are they suggesting to you\nThat you would receive a benefit because they would be able to de trade as opposed to trading at the close of the market on a given day is that the implication that they would be day trading within the day and you wouldn't have to wait till the end of the day because of that is what they're saying\nThen that makes no sense at all to me\nWell that was one of their points I think they were sort of pointing out getting off the market is we're predicting a drop in the market we could get out more quickly I think that was\nHer do they do they have a history of having successfully called drops in the market of that sort and then re entering after the drop has been complete or near ... near complete so they have a history of that that's been proved to you document\nHow would that be proven I didn't think she has\nA there's a good question there is a great question there is a good question well look obviously are obviously Chris this person is a salesperson right and ... and wants to open the account so that the fees can be accrued to the company I understand all that\nI I don't know I I haven't heard anything from this presentation\nThat which suggests to me that I should shell out twelve thousand five hundred dollars when I have a situation where I have a portfolio that is predominantly invested in index funds a portfolio that has performed very very well\nAre you having just single reason\nThe over diversification is not a\nI don't even know what that means what the heck does that mean if I owned a total stock market index\nThen which you do by the way a model three then that means I Am I essentially own the length and breath of the companies across America or I don't even know what I mean to me that sounds like something for the I'm On a negotiated\nOf the companies across America or I don't even know what I mean to me that sounds like something for the uh under negotiate over diversification if I have the total stock market index and my\nUh am I Am like well diversified of course I'm very well diversified if I might over diverse of what the heck does that mean [noise]\nThis is money to

time including program I appreciate that listener and subscribers since Nineteen Ninety and I say this one just for a make you feel warm but I just thank you but I'm I'm fortunate for past nine years so\nThis is a personal challenges I'm I have not been able to follow you or listen to the show\nAs I just started listening so I Need to advise I'm I'm going back to my old notes for have taken which I maintain I have the I ... I was and I'm going back into portfolio number one\n[noise] of course I'm going to the dollar cost averaging had this market but I'm Wondering what they really be considered as one accounts or should I really consider them as she was separated they can because it's one that's either one supplier\nAnd all their old you are all ... privilege that counts steps collect Yes sir I ... I Do like the top down approach and I would view them as one portfolio\nNext question find me very quick as I said past nine years I have not this and then I'm just getting back on my feet and I'm ... but let me let me add something also because of you I was able to um stay home and take care of my spouse has helped 'em\nAnd because of the things that ... I think that I'm\nOn a four percent will love a good show if somebody is making and it's an example fifty thousand dollars a year ... percent Detroit's or is that true of um lot few programs before it's like you were mentioning you need to have like two million dollars in able to\nUm based on a four percent of all of which will have about fifty thousand dollars and come to you\nI Would say that in order to generate an annual income of fifty thousand dollars a year\nYou wouldn't want to have a portfolio of approximately one and one quarter million dollars that would be one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if you were able to engineer a four percent withdrawal rate on that principle\nThen that would give you an annual income from that particular set of numbers of\nFifty thousand dollars a year I think that in the beginning you could start with the four percent withdrawal guideline you want to review it every year you want to make sure it's working but I think it is a reasonable starting point\nAnd that would mean on a million dollars that would generate approximately forty thousand and gross income and William first of all I Want to thank you for your kind words and secondly I Want to thank you very very much for calling in from Burbank, California\nAnd of course our program in Burbank, California and throughout the greater Los Angeles area is on the legendary K ABC Radio Los Angeles as we go to the great state of Minnesota\nRoy it is your return\nTaking my call Bob I really appreciate your program I thought of this lady that called in and you're told her how to save twelve thousand five hundred dollars by not doing something your program is invaluable to people I just enjoy it so much\nThey've called thousand five hundred dollars by not doing something your program is invaluable to people I just enjoy it so much listening to all the different questions because boy I tell you you learn a lot by\nHearing either the answers that you give them the reasons why but here's my question I Do subscribe to Bob drinkers market time timer and the my question is this\nI Know one portfolio three that you recommend the total stock market or is there anything wrong with having the total stock market and they asked him the five hundred yeah and the same retirement account\nI guess what I Would say or would simply be that the U.S and the five hundred is part of the total stock market index\nSo that if you owned a total total stock market index you already own yes and the five hundred\nOkay very good thank you I like him boy you know less than ... many times that I never heard anybody ask the question about that I just thought hey I Wonder what the answer would be the debt so thank you very much and have a great day\nThank you Roy and Roy is right that was a great question\nDoug is on the line and Val ... hello Doug welcome to Monday talk\nBob I'm I'm a longtime listener sent her son a long time ago\nAnd talked about taxation there's also a program where they tax Social Security benefits\nAre under introduced and it was upgraded and Ninety three whereby fry orders\nEarning thirty five thousand and joined cry or earning forty four thousand can add eighty five percent of their Social Security benefits exposed to federal income tax rate\nAlthough I'm not mistaken Doug they basically a subject all income to state and local taxes in states that have state taxes so whether the income is from Social Security or whether it's from um let's say rental income or whether it's from a\nSalary or whatever it may be if it's income it generally is taxed at the prevailing rates of the state you live in\nAnd what it does does\nYour Social Security benefit as I say to ten thousand if my thing is about thirty four thousand or my joint is about four thousand that triggers and they had you tax on my Social Security that I'm receiving\nAbsolutely correct but again this is in the income category this is money that is coming in to you in the form of additional money coming in from your Social Security account\nSo less his income anytime than at any point in my home working and now you were on that day and\nOf course you did and that's the reason you qualify for those payments but it's it's classified as income and when you classify it is incumbent become subject to the prevailing federal and state taxes under current law\n[laughter] that's true but don't you think that's a double taxation orange so security benefits\nI think it's double taxation all income when you when you have federal and state income tax on the states that have that which is a forty one on everything and forty three on earned\nHave that yeah of course it's double taxation but it's double taxation on income and that is prevailing across the country\nI'll give you a triple taxation Philadelphia gets triple X. station with the Philadelphia wage tax New York city triple taxation with the New York city income tax so I'll I'll take your double taxation and I'll raise the Andy just tripled taxi\nThank you Doug appreciate the call very much\nLet's get Jay on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago Jay it is your return welcome\nThank you um I was wondering if you invest in the ass in the five hundred or the total stock market is that considered or high risk investing\nWell uh it's a market risk investment is a stock market risk investment a zero risk investment would be an FDIC insured CD or a U.S treasury held the maturity held the maturity especially a treasury bill which the short term\nThat would be a zero risk investment but if you wanted to take a stock market risk investment that reflected that\nPerjury bill which is short term that would be a zero risk investment but if you wanted to take a stock market risk investment that reflected the risk in the stock market at large that would be reflected in the U.S and be five hundred\nBecause um [noise] um [noise] a recommendation is quite a bit and uh\nOh no question about it in Iraq to pass a port a let me thank you for the call Jay thanks for calling\nThere's no question about it that in our act to pass a portfolio we have a significant application to the market at large by using index fund investing no question about that and so that means that a person that's invested their is willing\nTo take the risk of being in the market and has the tolerance for risk to be they're very important points and I'm Glad you made them Jay and again appreciate the call very very much\nMoney talk on a man of course is money you talk to go and

I moved to the land of critical man it's about a year and a half ago [noise]\nUm let's see I'm I'm a I'm confused about eighty five and hoping that you can straighten out my thinking you're ready here goes [noise]\nA few months ago I heard an economist state that into future ATF ... mutual fund is at the time it does make sense to me but then a few weeks ago I was watching a seminar or with Jon Vogel\nPenn or\nAny stated that because of speculation of ATMs by a active traders\nThe return of ATF for the last ten years are lower than traditional mutual or traditional investment funds how does this mean that if I buy and hold for ten years in each of 'em up resenting or for example if you have to be five hundred index\nAnd during the same uh during this time ... E. T. S. is being actively traded by speculators will migrate during the life like it would be in a mutual fund or do you think bobcat Bogle was referring to eat the Arabs in general with the uh\nEasy access to buy and sell anytime\nThat's exactly what he was referring to because what he's talking about is that if somebody is trading\nBuy and sell anytime\nThat's exactly what he was referring to because what he's talking about is that if somebody is trading and an exchange traded mutual fund which by the way is a mutual fund remember that\nA mutual funds have three forms they have no low visual funds loaded mutual funds and exchange traded mutual funds which are called ATF\nSo they're all mutual funds so what he's talking about\nIs that people have traded in and out of exchange traded mutual funds and it's been to the disadvantage to do that trading or because they haven't been able to match the buying hold return in that particular fun that's what he's referring to\nI see I see so if you were a by an old investor for ten years you would learn what the ... and if it was an index fund and the S. and P. it would essentially are and what the S. and P. earns but if you were trading in and out which is what he was referring to chances are you buy at the top sell at the bottom and not do as well\nI got it okay well the Irish\nBut always keeping always thank you always keep in mind a very important factor or when we talk about mutual funds we have three forms of mutual funds with no known Michel funds\nWe have loaded mutual funds and we have exchange traded mutual funds and the exchange traded mutual funds called ... where the acronym they trade during the day\nAnd that's perhaps the biggest difference with an exchange traded mutual fund is that a trades during the day the problem that creates is if you're too active in your trading approach you can wind up selling low buying high and not doing as well as the index\nAppreciate the call\nMoney talks comes your way each

south corrected IRAs by the letter that serves in Congress don't considering our travel around the area where there and\nHow investments how investments and the u._k.\nUm I'd say that family fatty\nThat's good I like that for a self directed IRA and what I Would do is I go to one of the low cost custodian outfits that have a lot of funds that you can choose from and a lotta no load funds to choose from and\nI'm Talking about a vanguard or fidelity or someone that has a large stable of low cost to know load funds to choose from they can be your custodian and you can invest according to your self direction\nOkay and what's your thoughts about diversifying into real estate or other ventures as go ...\nI'm not a I'm not a fan of gold but I certainly would um would would consider owning your principal residents if you can do so do you earn on your principal residents\nI but I don't think it All right well then living around state are you there\nOr you can live on your own civil resident you can ... oh no no I'm not talking about it than I already know I'm not recommending that you put your ah your real estate in your IRA no I'm not making that recommendation\nNow there are some that have used real estate investment trust in a ... a couch and you can do that and I know for example a vanguard they have a a a no load fund which is an index to real estate investment trust which has many many different companies\nIT companies in the index and certainly that's something that if you choose to do so in your mix you can include that\nBut um in terms of putting a rental properties that you would assembled now I Would I be disinclined to do it that way appreciate the call Kate thank you for joining us good to hear from you\nInformation on my investments letter that

washing my car's listening to you I really appreciate your voice over the years I've a question for you that you talk about routinely investing into your employer sponsored retirement fund but my question for you today is\nIf I have the funds to maximize my employer match\nUp to the match but beyond should I just go to the match and company match and then do the Roth and then returned back to my company match if I have the funds to do so\nWell that's an option or certainly want to go up to the match me nuts the no brainer part of your question absolutely want to go up to the match to take full advantage of the free money\nThat the company is giving you in the form of the uh matching program now or whether you go to a raw or traditional i._r._a. really there is going to the beyond that is going to depend also on whether you want that the ducks and right now are you in a high bracket\nI I Am\nAnd that would be thirty seven percent so that would be the same as getting a thirty seven percent a tax deduction on the money you put in that's a lot of money\nOkay so that's\nWhy we've built into them I Would consider that I Would I Would consider that thirty seven percent as of now is if\nYou wanted to diversify more than ... you could but I think if you're into thirty seven percent top bracket or as a high earners and I think that's a really nice and set of going with the traditional ... as long as you qualify under the rules [noise] this is America's money ... money [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] this is money to [noise]\nMust think about ... percent it by liberty mutual insurance liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need so why\nWell here's the deal if you if you roll your if you're eligible to roll your account or into something like a a a self directed IRA at a place like a vanguard or if it down to the um I think you will find that uh especially if you're using index funds which have very low expense ratio is\nI think you'll find it very inexpensive\n\nNow here's here's the question do you need to ask you need to find out whether you're still eligible to contribute to your for all three baby if you do that\n[noise] um as far as I can determine I Am I don't I don't want to stop for all three\nNow so you want to confirm that with your confirmed that with your HR yeah yes or a very important yes thank you Bob\nThis is very very important that if you make a decision to make a change in your four one K. for all three be whatever like that where you're going to do a roll over\nMake sure that your HR department confirms do you that you can still make your own going contribution to your account because this can vary from plan to plant\nDave is on the line listening to number one W. B. E. N. radio buffalo hello David\n... thank you for taking my call I appreciate it um well my question is if I'm pursuing a business opportunity on the um [noise] and try I actually I mean I think the ... some money from the IRA do continuously bonded\nA I'm not going to like totally but by everything I'm obviously this year the income has been alone so the impact you know and I think it would be there uh what's your take on something like that\nI that I'm not going to totally a ... thing it's like let me unquote oh no I don't need it so to speak [noise]\n[noise] well my understanding is that if you are how old are you David\nForty odd\nUnderstanding is that at your age if you take money out of your IRA you're going to have to pay a penalty\nForty odd\nMy understanding is that at your age if you take money out of your IRA you are going to have to pay a penalty on a withdrawal for not being fifty nine and a half and you're also going to have to pay in Buffalo the prevailing federal and state tax\n\nNow there is a way to potentially reduce your tax burden on that by setting up a seat core\nAnd establishing a corporate retirement account\nAnd if you do that if you do that and what I'd recommend\nBecause this might be beneficial to you why would recommend is that you sit down with a certified public it counted in your case and see if they can be helpful to you\nShow\nBy an hour of their time purchased an hour of their time go over it and see if they can be helpful to you because they may be able to\nUh to help you to set the account up in such a way that you can use the money and reduce your burden because right now without that if you just take money out of an IRA at the age of forty five even if you're using it in your business or to fund anything at that point\nYou have a premature withdrawal ... and you have federal and state tax in Buffalo so that's what I Would do I definitely are invested in an hour as a time of day a certified public accounting to go over that\nLet's get out to the show me state of Missouri and Tom is on the line Tom it's your turn\nI thank you Bob I'm seemed like there's been articles or a book the death of retail and so forth and I'm Wondering if uh\nIf that continues if if we can see the situation where the S. and P. five hundred could become the S. and P. fifty or the S P five and and where hundreds of companies could just drop\nOut by by having Amazon and Walmart everything [noise]\nWell I Know sometimes it must feel like we're heading in that direction I can certainly understand why people would\nGet that feeling I think some people were surprised when Amazon one out in the choir and whole foods and the uh the Justice Department had very little to say about it uh I I think that there's as long as the Justice Department is inactive\nIn that area then they can just you can acquire as many companies as you can afford to acquire\nAs long as you don't have any uh interference from the Justice Department I mean that's exactly what you saw when Amazon dot com took over whole foods or there was basically no real pushback from the Justice Department the deal went right through it happened pretty quick\nSo that's the way it works if they're not going to say anything about it then certainly companies are going to make strategic mergers\nSo if I if that becomes extreme it's just a little bit scary about to even have like S P why having the sector funds and with with the idea that maybe hundreds of those companies could slowly disappear [noise]\nWell I mean it's already happened in a way I mean the number of companies out there has been shrinking pretty dramatically\nAnd ah initiatives that just look at the industry's look what's happened to the airline industry what do you have now basically four major carriers I mean a couple of decades ago you had a dozen or so so I mean what do you have now you have four major carriers right you have American you have delta\nU.S South west and you have a\nAmerican delta southwestern United radio for major carriers and everybody else compared to those carriers their minor players\nIf I'm a\nI was already happened in some sectors\nThat's true\nBut you're right I mean it is there is a trend towards consolidation and consolidation has a tendency to reduce the number of companies that are out there was one exception what about all the start ups what about the new companies that are that are out down there haven't been many IPO's but still there are companies being added\nSeemed like I remember IPO's are common at the peak of the market and says sometimes use as an indicator to for the markets cycle and so well\nThere there are a lot of indicators out there they're located I mean they're literally over over you could easily put out over a hundred indicators when you start talking about indicators keep in mind that okay this indicator might say one thing but another indicator may may say something else\nYeah that's right there's a there's tons tons of indicators and I'm about to ... seems like they're they're not\nOh yeah that's you're right there's there's tons and tons of indicators in the ... to ... seems like they're\nThey're not in line with anything that they're not over here to Tom ... the the they're not overheated so so like I say this stuff is all over the less sometimes but when these things start to get on the same page that's a different story that's a different story for short\nAppreciates call Tom\nThis is America's money program Monday talk [noise]\nMoney talks\nAnd official methods for
