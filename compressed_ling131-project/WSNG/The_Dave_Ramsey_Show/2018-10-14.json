C. M. O. radio Kansas City Marty it's your turn\nEither side you very much in your last newsletter you're talking about the inverted yield curve and you're saying to measure that\nBy the federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury note Iran another article that youth or some other author uses the two year no versus the ten year old and then I read yet another article that said we can't use the two year versus the ten year because of\nCurrent international money flows I say what he meant was that\nA lot of foreign buyers treasury notes are skewing that at a relationship um and if you look at the two year versus the ... year it's pretty close I mean they're getting pretty close but if you use that use the federal funds rate versus the ten year they're not that close at all\nSo I Would like to hear your comments on it but if you want to live\nWell I Can't comment on the others that you quote but I Will certainly speak for myself there was a reason\nThere was a reason a really good reason that we mentioned in the um uh the August investment letter that we use the um we'd like to use the federal funds rate compared to the ten year treasury\nYou remember what we said there\nI'm not sure exactly what you're referring to but I did read it [laughter]\nWell I'll read the paragraph act or from the uh read the paragraph from the August investments\nI did read it [laughter] well I'll read the paragraph ... from the I'll read the paragraph from the August investment letter and uh that will shed light on it let me read it word for word because the only take a short time\nThe interest rates spread is one of the ten components of the leading economic index compiled by the conference board monthly\nThis component measures the difference between the ten year treasury yields and the federal funds\nRate I'll read that portion of the paragraph and ask you if that sheds any light on why I have a focused on that particular metric\nOf so okay so if we get our inverted you for a two year old and you know\nThat's not what I said well no that's that's not what I was talking about I was talking about the question you asked which was why did I use the federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury yields and\nAs I said in the investment letter in August the interest rate spread which is what you're talking about is one of the ten components of the leading economic index\nCompiled by the conference board monthly\nAnd this component measures the difference between the ten year treasury and the federal funds rate does that answer the question you had about why I selected that particular comparison\nI'm somewhat but uh so if there was a bucket of you for with to hear a little ten year that wouldn't accept it literally warrior\nI don't want to see a negative view curves anywhere I don't want to see a negative you gr anywhere but my focus would be right now on\nThe short term rate the federal funds rate versus the ten year and the reason I like to focus on that is that that is a component in the leading economic index\nExploit it very much for your time\nThank you for calling now bottom line that all of this is\n... and we always get the same crowd this same\nCrowd comes out of the woodwork every time this happens they come out of the woodwork every single time this happens and they say oh this time it's different or this time it doesn't matter\nBecause ABC indeed\nWell let me be clear I think it matters\nI think the yield curve is important no I think the yield curve is very important and so\nIf you get into a situation where you get an inverted yield curve for example between the leading economic index yield curve method which is the federal funds\nRate versus the ten year treasury I think that's a big deal there are a lot of other factors that come into play that such as lead times lead time on ... on the inversion become very important\nAt that point and there's a lot more in addition to that\nBut if we're talking about the basics the yield curve inversions matter yeah I think they matter is there a way that measures yield curve and versions that is consistent with the leading economic\nIndex yeah there is federal

a bottom I'm looking at the a paragraph that you referenced earlier and I was wondering can you tell me what it is that makes it tenure at treasury yield increase\n[noise] well yeah there are number of factors great question Don fantastic question and yes there are a number of factors that come into play on this I Would say that um the principal factors that make the ten year right go up\nWould be ah inflation expectations which is really a market factor of Federal Reserve monetary policy is you know they're on a dual track right now raising rates in the quantitative type thing along with it that's certainly a factor\nAnd I would say those would be the major factors what is the Federal Reserve doing but when you look at federal policies in response to what's going on\nAnd so that's where the inflation expectations become very very important as inflation expectations increase the Federal Reserve tends to further tightening monetary policy [noise]\nSo you have that going on as well but with the fed on a dual track right now we're in uncharted waters on that policy this has really never occurred before\nOkay thank you very much like you'd done yeah and I think that uh this is something will have to continue to monitor I'm On the one hand you know some people might say gee you know why is a fed chair Jerome Powell on concerned are particularly I'm concerned about inflation right now\nWhen the consumer price index is two point nine percent year over year and the answer is because that's really not the one he is focusing on he and his compiled raised at the fed\nThey are focusing on the core personal consumption expenditures index and that has been very very close to the target level established by the Federal Reserve that target level is two percent dew point do\nWell it's been like right in a one point nine percent area recently and\nBased on the uh estimates that are out there are some people expect to get up to the two percent level when when the data is released on the revised gross domestic product\nOr this coming week there will be the revised number one data there'll be\nKnow when the data's released on the revised gross domestic product\nA this coming week there will be the revised the number one data there'll be revised number two data coming a month later and so that's just quarterly data though that's not the import all important your your number so when we take a look at the fed policy\nWe have to consider okay they're raising rates okay they're throwing debt onto the market in the form of the corner to tightening program as they remove it from their balance sheet in very large numbers\nTrillions actually over time and so all of these factors come into play and that's why it's really important what the fed chair says about\nWhat's going on with inflation and what he's saying right now is he is not especially exercised about the rate of inflation\nThat's because he's focusing on the fact that we've had this personal consumption expenditures core inflation right in at one point nine percent area perhaps to go to ... percent soon\nWays okay with that because that was the level that the federal open market committee established as a target back when figures were lower\nNow the reason and this comes up all the time the reason they don't want to go below two percent is because they really fear deflation\nIn the eyes of the fed one of the worst things are going up\nIs deflation because when you get deflation than the opposite of inflation happens what happens with inflation was inflation you're paying back your debt with depreciated money and networks in your favor against your debt payment\nThat applies both to the interest and the principal with deflation you're paying back your debts and increasing costs good the bad with your money is going down\n[noise] and so that increases the cause of your debt [noise] you're the value of your money is critical in this case the view that [noise] the place you and\nYour debts become more expensive and your interest on your desk become more expensive the opposite effect of the places on your desk tenure is more to come stay with

diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index has either one of those out this would be a good place to start thank you for the county eight year old\nFor the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks\nIn about four years so you have to be a aware of that as well\nAnd so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio of by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets some liquidity I mean in that portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commission checked we can't make four year for cash so in the market at least I can I don't have a four year forecast on the market\nUh so uh you know you have to consider a if you made a four year forecast on the market in Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been they asked him the five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand so making a four\nYear forecasts do more of the market's going to be is is a ... activity\nBut uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here where you should be able to um to hopefully benefit from having some money and the total stock market index in that account\nAnd uh I I Would just be sensitive to the fact that you don't want to get to the point where I'm let me ask you would you be writing tuition checks out of this account yes\nWell then you want to see that's what I'm Talking about you want to manage that account and such a way that uh you're not going to get caught in the bear market at a time when you're writing tuition checks you don't want to go there so you want to provide some liquidity provision in that account\nThat's going to enable you to have that money available for tuition without having to sell out of a bear market hypothetically if one were to occur at the time\nThis is going to enable you to have that money available for tuition without having to sell out of a bear market hypothetically if one were to occur at the time ... years down the road where you needed that because it is I think that would be the most important point\nLawn checking in front of the gate great Kenyan us radio in the ... high city of Denver, Colorado\nLet's get Jim on the line in ... Gen it's your turn\nOf the uh Hi, Bob and first of all I Want to thank you for your your ah not sharing your knowledge ah with everyone it's like I Can't tell you how much it's appreciate it [noise] ah my my question is\nI Want to transfer the owner of a balance my portfolio to run around and fifty fifty and\nUm that means I've got to move over from a non Ira ... ah I have a total stock market non Ira total stock market into\nA bond fund and\nI'm concerned about possible tax consequences the ... and it's about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars so but I have to pay do I have to pay taxes first of all and would I of have to pay taxes from the time I started that fun\nOr on today in today's current him out or how would that work\nAll right well let's talk about this account now what type of the only count is this three hundred and fifty thousand in right now\nIt's in the I'm not total bond market okay which is another issue I well I'm sure with you because you've suggested or a short term and my phone company recommends that's vanguard they recommend that I don't do that\nYeah well I Know I like where they are they're they're not going to agree with everything I say and I'm not going to agree with everything they say you can take that to the bank um so you have three hundred and fifty thousand dollars right now invested into total bond market how long has that been invested their\nNo I I Want to transfer over three hundred and ... it's been in there for a least a couple of years\nOr let's start this over what type of an account is this\nA both are non Ira accounts so this ... this is personal money yes okay so you have a three hundred and fifty thousand you have the three to fifty thousand dollars in personal money is that right right I Want her transferred over I mean\nLet me just let me just go step baby steps here so I can get this straight so we have three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in personal money where's that money right now\nIt's at a it's an ... a total stock market\n\nIs that what you're seeing more so this is stunning talk mark yes and how long has it been there\nOh years and years and years I'd say okay so you're just going Fifteen Twenty years so you don't usually don't experience ... I'm Sorry so it's done in the stream Lee well you have a low cost based on yes it's really done well\nWell if you sell any shares now have you use the average cause basis or have you used a specific cost basis\nI'm not familiar with well when you want to share that you buy them all at once yes\nOkay well then in that case that that by definition that is specific costs basis 'cause you'll only made one purchased how much money did you put in you remember\n[noise] no I don't but I'm a ... it was somewhere around oh I'd have to say somewhere around seven hundred thousand and now it's up to about a ... a one point seven five million so I wanted to\nTake off your only taking your only taking a portion of that yeah\nI'm taking a maybe a third or thereabouts me a little bit more uh\nSo uh well three fifty out a one and three quarters would be a be a lot less than a third it'd be maybe twenty percent something like that so uh\nHere's the deal\nSeveral ... many years ago you put approximately you can look it up but you're guessing seven hundred thousand and the total stock market index is that right\nYes okay yes\nAnd uh and some very well to run a one point seven five now all this time that you own that fund\nWhich I guess is the vanguard till the stock market index correct right\nI Know around I own a fun I Know this one well I've owned upon for a long long time so\nYou've received\nDividends on that fun on a quarterly basis and in some cases overtime capital appreciation what has happened to those distributions that they've paid out to the shareholders\nI keep I just\nOn Capitol appreciation what has happened to those distributions that they've paid out to the shareholders\nI keep I just keep them in that in that fun OK you reinvest I reinvest uh okay\nThen in that case you're close bases is not as simple as that would have been because by reinvest thing you have created new cost bases each time you've reinvest it so what you might want to do is a she if you could develop a new might help you at the\nFun family if you could develop or maybe they've already provided you with an average cost basis that case I don't really know\nWe're going to have to know you're going to have to know because when you make transactions gym and a personal account you're going to be subject in your case to federal and state taxation on the game\nAnd uh your maximum currently under current law your maximum federal tax liability and the highest bracket would be twenty three point eight percent of any money that you take out\nOn the game the only ... percent ... well that's just federal I didn't get to your state yet but twenty three point eight percent would be the highest rate you would have to pay if you're in the top bracket\nOr on any games that could be less if you're in lower brackets it could be less than that but then on top of that you're going to have to pay state tax on any gain you take out now in the state you live in the ... the top bracket would be about forty one percent\nAnd I'm In the lower ... probably know among the lowest are\nPrivate and that's ... that's going to help you as going to bring it way down because if you're in the minimal brackets you can get\nDown to very very low percentages you want to figure this out with your tax preparation expert or your enrolled agent or your CPA\nTo find out what kind of a tax liability and we're going to have 'cause you want to reserve that money because you're into to pay that money out to a Washington at the end Sacramento in the form of taxes by if you take these games this year you'll have to make those payments by a while of as part of you as\nPart of your tax payments that you're making on your two thousand Eighteen return\nYou don't have to file your return till next year but you may have to make estimated famous depending on how large numbers are that's between you and your accountant or your enrolled agent or a CPA but whatever\nI think bottom line here you might have some tax liability and I think if you do take three hundred and fifty out I think it will have some tax liability cause your money has a well more than doubled while you've added in there\nAnd by the way even taking the average cost in most of your costs is going to be based on your\nInitial expense of approximately seven hundred thousand dollars so I I Would and I would ask you to go through all of that as far as the other a part of it going into the ... market no I Would not do that\nYou mentioned short short duration bonds bond\nFun yeah yeah and you know if you don't want to if you don't want to do that there's a really simple way for you to do it\nYou can do a a a ladder of a three six nine twelve months CDs equal amounts in that case you could spread it out roughly close to Ninety thousand and three months six months nine months twelve month", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Torrington", "day": "14"}
