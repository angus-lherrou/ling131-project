talk\nHi thank you so much Bob I I've come to your program fairly recently kind of late in life or if you will and I'm enjoying the program and I am a subscriber now to the newsletter\nBut my challenge as I I've got about a two hundred and fifty thousand in the balance index fun at vanguard which I'm learning now you don't recommend because of the\nUm the the the bonds and they're at a or a day or longer duration [noise]\nUm and as I'm moving towards trying to being portfolio three I've got some funds now in the in the bonds that you're recommending there but I'm Wondering should I stop\nPutting my money and the balanced index fund and open up the a total stock market with it being as high as it is and then if I Do should I just move everything from that balanced index to the total stock market I'm On\nA little bit of a quandary 'cause most of your callers seem to be a long time listeners and I'm really not\nWell I think the first question to ask is what kind of an asset allocation are you comfortable with in terms of the percentage of money that you have in the stock market and the percentage of money you have an income securities what percentages are you comfortable with\nWell um I think I'll be I Am comfortable with the fifty fifty and I'm really trying to work a towards that fact I think I probably have a because I put some cash that I acquired recently in the money market account for the prime money market account\nI I really have an asset allocation that is really about sixty percent bonds or other and only about thirty five percent inequities\nWhat I Would do a and you have the investment letter so it's easy for you to do is I Would look at page eight at the balanced portfolio model three\nWhich basically is if you look at the percentage column that's a fifty fifty balanced portfolio based on the percentage allegations and that would be my top recommendations for how to be invested\nAt this point between the stock market and the fixed income and when you when you looked at the fixed um income you're going to notice we have a very short average duration in fact the average duration in our income portfolio on page seven is less than one year\nAnd it's very similar for the fixed income portion of model three so that would be the approach that I Would take and the reason would be as you said I really am not a fan right now is having the longer the rations\nAnd I think if you look at the performance of the longer the ration bond funds they really have been dragged\nUh they've really been a had a drag on those on their performance and that drag has been what's happened to interest rates I mean after all it was only two years ago that the ten year treasury was one and three ... percent\nJust two years ago in the summer of sixteen the ten year treasury was building one and three eight percent now shielding two and seven eight percent so it has more than doubled and you over the last two years and I think that has really been a drag on\nFunds that have had longer bonds into portfolio and let me say welcome to money talk always great to hear from Nashville, Tennessee\nOr toll free line one eight hundred nine three four

old be involved if at this juncture\nWhen in fact the market is reaching all time high with they\nLet me up and let me ask you let me ask you a question uh now that you mentioned age are you thinking in terms of retirement at any time\nOh I'm a retired been retired you as\nWell in let's start out by saying I Am way more comfortable way more comfortable at that point\nOf having a a balanced portfolio which would start out basically with a fifty fifty allocation so you're allocation would be different than the allocation I Would choose in that situation\nEven though I'm at Seventy Seventy thirty what delete your ... and whatever\nThere you're you're you said you were Seventy percent equities I think is that right\nNo no no no I'm I'm Seventy percent neutral Mosul mutual funds\nOkay well are are you are you talking about mutual funds of stocks\nNo snow so I knew ... whatever the case may be which\nParty they have it that way at least I Would be stocks or what percentage of your portfolio is in the stock market or stock market mutual funds\nI Would say about forty five percent\nOkay so you're pretty close to fifty fifty right now\nYes sir I Am okay yeah I don't have\nA problem with are investing in exchange traded funds as an alternate the mutual funds I say this is sometimes our listeners will say you know I'd rather have an exchange traded mutual fund than a no low pond\nAnd of course there are no load anyway but they're they're they're trading during the day so they changed traded funds\nTrade like stocks I don't have any problem for those who want to use\nAn alternate for ... let me give you a um specific example of what I'm telling you about sometimes we'll talk to a money talks caller and we'll save\nThe total stock market index right and then they'll say well why I'd rather invested in exchange traded funds and then will say well we'll go with Victor tango India right the TI that's an exchange traded mutual fund\nFor the total stock market index and so that's fine I don't have a problem with that if a if a personal preference is to invest in Victor tango India the TI exchange traded shares instead of a till the stock market in ...\nI don't have any problem with that at all so I'm comfortable perfectly comfortable with using a\n... an author net exchange traded mutual fund for a specific no fun to keep in mind not all ... funds have an older than that exchange traded mutual fund but it's certainly there's an example in the case of the total stock market and the case so yes the five hundred or a good example is um\nIs SBY the SBY shares the spy shares\nAgain in exchange for a mutual fund which invests in the as the five hundred index in that case just like the ... funds that invest in ESP five hundred and actually generally get very very low expense ratio is if you're dealing with the right firms in these areas\nMargaret is ah on the line listening to the great Kate and us radio Denver Margaret welcome\nHigh

even appropriate in your situation a hope that you have do you have an investment portfolio right now\nI Do and let me tell you after listening to your show for years I should be doing a lot better but I wasn't always doing what you said to do\nSo I Am for my friends to listen carefully and do as you say so um I Do I'm In your model portfolio three right now and I have um [noise]\nWell I bought

when the hurricane season is over\nYeah not a bad idea there at all [laughter] specially especially on the Gulf Coast in that area so you think you'll do you think you'll live there fulltime\nI think I well I'm I'll be back in Chicago because I Love it here and summer's are beautiful here yes so um yeah I'll be back and forth I'm not quite certain I'm retired so I figure I can do whatever I Want

three um\nProbably about eight twenty thousand dollars\nSo that might be enough for emergency fund for you ah\nI'd probably about eight twenty thousand dollars\nOkay so that might be enough for emergency fund for you or I Would just say I would just say that in looking at that three hundred if you want to you could take a portion of that and add that to your contingency reserve funds so that you always have the peace of mind knowing\nThat of an unexpected expense or arises you have that money sitting there and I would use something like uh the um [noise] my favorite place right now for short term money is the vanguard prime money market and the ... let me tell you the reason I like the the vanguard prime money market\nUh first of all children over two percent which is a very generous shield at today's uh today's world for a for short term money\nAnd um and the second thing is is liquid which means that you ask them for a checkbook you get a check book on the account and you can write checks two hundred and fifty dollars or more you can even pay bills\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars or more but more importantly you have a check writing ability\nA tour of fifty dollars or more in all cases you a check writing ability and that's a great way\nTo have a money market account with liquidity with check writing so that's my favorite way to invest short term money and if

up twenty point eight percent on a year over year basis\nAnd I'm the office of management and budget is now projecting a budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September of eight hundred forty nine billion dollars yes this is during an economic recovery that yes this is\nWhat is normally called good times for the economy\nThis will be the largest fiscal year deficit since two thousand twelve and

of ten increase in spending four point oh increase in revenue zero point for on a year over year basis where is this coming from\nBut it has a it has recovered a meaningful portion of the decline that occurred starting in January two thousand Seventeen now what happens is when did you start investing in this fun by the way\nBy January Bob\nUh well it's ironic if you had started investing in a fund in January of two thousand Seventeen you would have had the opposite question absolutely you you would have called in and you you would have said I've noticed this fund is doing very well\nHow much of how well it's doing is because of currency and I was told you the dollar has been getting rocked because it got rocked in two thousand Seventeen went down substantially\nAnd that flowed through to the benefit of an international fund that that is dealing in local currencies\nAnd now the opposite is true the dollar has been rebounding and it has the opposite effect on international funds and a dollar fluctuates it goes up it goes down it goes sideways\nFrom the standpoint of international investing\nThe currency factor is most positive when the dollar is weak um it is kind of neutral when the dollar is flat against foreign currencies but when the dollar is rising as it has been in recent months against foreign currencies\nThan it's definitely a head when you should use certainly should see that in a flood ... let's get up to Charlotte North Carolina Jeff it is your term welcome hey Bob\nThanks for taking my call list or a subscriber would've thank you for all your work or one of the book recommended a highly recommended reading list or seven where John Bogle so little book on an index flown\nA fascinating read it out\nThere where everybody appreciate that recommendation I had a question\nAbout the standard deduction itemized deductions we've always itemized and we've always been able to do that because of our our ... our our mortgage interest in other uh you know Monday we'd give it to charity and other leading this year it looks like we are going to be shot\nBeing able to itemize with a big it's double twenty four thousand a for a\nIt has to do it for so much of what what is the rate on your ...\nFor a are married and has the door for\nSo much of what what is the rate on your mortgage it's more than a end the call that you had earlier I got my wheels turning that maybe that's not a bad idea anymore because you know because we wouldn't be getting that\nYou know we wouldn't be getting that additional or the you know\nA benefit to the money um is is that somewhere to put some money and as a way to kind of ballots in like you said it's guaranteed that no risk is that something to look at\nPens on the right doesn't it yeah\nAnd his ... his his rate was four point six five which is er in today's world is a fairly elevated interest rate um but a year at four and an eighth a but you're right it is a guaranteed rich free return when you're ... more than eight percent loan\nOr if you don't have tax deducted ability because of the changes in the tax code\nThen the only other thing you have going for you was in place you\nKnow it would be fair for you to say well the loan as cost me in the last year the lowest cost me for it and they bought you're paying back dollars that have been affected by inflation of two point nine it would be right for you to it would therefore be fair for you to say that the real cause the money\nFor you over the last year it's been one only two so in other words inflation is a friend in inflation is your friend in terms of just discounting the real cost\nGot it so that's not as attractive as\nWell or you aren't paying back depreciated dollars by definition as a result of inflation and a well let me give you an example if inflation was was foreign aid that would be free money\nRight\nBecause the money you're paying back to the lender will not by what had bought a year ago that's the reason I\nGot it very good okay much you appreciate it repeated a\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's why\nThe weight on the mortgage is so important when you make a determination whether you want to repay a mortgage take out a mortgage or do anything with a mortgage the rate\nThat you're paying or no money is a key element the tucked ability is certainly a factor inflation is certainly a factor Don's on the line in Illinois done it's your turn\nYou off ... when I call imam portfolio three in the non taxable accounts\nI end the joint tax will count but my wife I I'm In for the total stock market and the prime money markets where did you have the ear to bond funds to the\nFixed position for model three on from model three right in and they\nAre ... account\nYou don't have the ability to uh put your fixed income investments in attacks ...\n[noise] ah no longer I'm a I have no ah earned income\n\nYou have any tax privileged accounts that you're currently managing\nI too yes my wife and my own and they're and they're all they're sexually and portfolio three\nYeah I Do like the idea of putting a fixed income pawns in tax privilege accounts because you don't have to pay its current tax on the interest\nWell but they this is this is a non attacks from ... just as the joint chap stick out see I'm I'm retired and the only other investments I can make are taking pension buddy and putting it into the\nTax bill to count because when you're ... you know in or if you're going to come with your marginal tax bracket a Fifteen Percent or twenty five percent excuse me or does that include Illinois [noise]\nI guess it does ah but I'm I'm a ... the pension as a teacher's French and so I don't pay on the pension and I I think\nI think I think I Would be willing to go ahead with that\nA devout Jew or a bond funds from part for the three and put\nIt and we have we have three bond\nFunds right but I'm I'm I'm already in the primary Marcus was yeah\nI I Would be OK using at the twenty five percent bracket rate or I Would be OK using a yes because um you're still keeping most of that money\nI see\nI Would be OK using a yes because um you're still keeping most of them when\nI see a and if the if the river lowered it be even better\nThe tax rate to zero zero would be good would be good [laughter]\nBecause I'm looking into effective tax rate and it's you know not paying twenty five percent\nNo I'm not looking at the effective tax rate I'm looking at the marginal\nMart Marjah was twenty five percent yeah\n'cause that's what you're going to pay any additional income the way that you make that why marginal mattered a that is why marginal mothers but this decision effective really doesn't matter for this decision it's all about marginal it's all about the ... it's all about\nThe next dollar you make what will you pay on the next dollar you make but yes I Am comfortable with it ah and um you know I think it's only five percent I Would go ahead

term rates federal funds rate the a three month treasure bill rate they're going higher\nAnd most likely they will go higher in one quarter of one percent increments into next year the next two which I expect in September ... September federal open market committee meeting\nSo that's kind of baked into cake if the economy continues to grow we consider that baked indicate that rates continue to rise\nIn the short term but what about longer term rich what about the ten year read I mentioned the ten year rate has more than doubled in the last two years from one in three days to two and seven eighths what happens to longer rates like ten year rates going forward well\n\nLonger rates rise that certainly would make sense given the fact that if you combine real GDP Growth with inflation right now you could justify a four point eight percent ten year\nCertainly a four percent last ten year lease right and the way we get that is by adding together the growth rate in real GDP the and we don't just take one month or one quarter we take annual rates if we take the last twelve months through June\nThese are numbers we have in hand right now\nThe last twelve months through June real gross domestic product role is to point eight percent so we have that number and we also have inflation over the last year and for this purpose we would use the personal consumption expenditures core index\nWhich is one point nine and so if we add together the or one point nine of the two point eight week at four point seven and that would be uh\nAll right and so if we add together the or one point nine of the two point eight we'd get four point seven and that would be a normalize ten year rate\nAnd a little ad that\nWe have to seven days so were considerably below four and a fraction foreign any fraction were still considerably below a two and seven eight so\nIf rates do rise that would be a normalization and that would make economic sense but what a phrase just don't go up much or don't go up at all from this love what happens then when the federal funds rate and the Ninety One day tea bill rake continue to rise to the fed\nPolicy but you could run the risk down the road not right now but you could run the risk\nDown the road where the yield curve would invert we're short rates would exceed longer rates well if that were to happen\nThat would be one of the precondition and it would be unimportant reconditioned that we would then have in place\nFor a recession outlook something to keep in mind if we don't see an increase in the longer term rates and if the short term rates keep rising do the fed policy we run the risk\nOf an inversion\nAnd that's where the catch twenty two analogy comes into play on the one hand it would make common sense\nEconomically speaking for the ten year rate to move higher but on the other hand if it doesn't move higher and the short term rates keeps going up that's where you get into the catch twenty two inversion interesting\nThought will certainly going to be fascinating to watch a as we say we shall notice in the fullness of time let's get Richard on the line in Lincoln, Nebraska Richard welcome\nHi, Bob [noise] um [noise] my daughter when she was to inherited a I don't know fifty or sixty thousand I put it all in a a vanguard\nS. and P. five hundred index and er she's Eighteen now and as you know that's done very well [noise]\nUm [noise] my question is I'm thinking about putting it all in the ah vanguard Tony stock market index just kinda spread her risk out and [noise]\nI don't know tell her to leave it alone and she should be doing All right um [noise] as time goes by what ... what are you what's your thought of that and I a dollar cost averaging or can I just\nThrow it in their [noise] well\nWhat woman would there be tax consequences on his\n[noise] um I don't think so 'cause [noise] and they had you know I've just taken it out of ah [noise]\nTaking it out of the five hundred and putting in a stock markets and accidents inherited money so I don't I don't think so but I guess I don't know that for sure\nIs it personal money is it her personal money is is is that in some type of a special account what's the deal it's her personal money that sounds like a taxable event to me\nWell I'm Glad I called you then um\nYeah I Would suspect uh what what do you think is the average cost on the money that she has there\nI'm missing piece of twenty eight fifty what would your guess be would be the average us in because the money I I don't understand the question how many years how many years of the you invested in the sixteen him\nAnd did it all go in at the beginning yep All right so sixteen\nUh is two thousand two right so the costs on this thing could be eight or nine hundred versus the twenty eight fifty you might have a triple in your hands as this thing triple\nYeah yeah that's a taxable gain\nOkay [laughter] well I'm Glad I called you that I I think I'll just leave it in there and\nYou know the money that came in and dividends enough money that came in and this and the dividends every year that was taxable every year you know that right\nBut the capital appreciation on the shares that you were originally purchase that have looks like they've tripled in value basically right that is that is a long term capital gain and that is\nA potentially a taxable event depending on a hurts\nIs that is a long term capital gain and that is a\nPotential attack civil event depending on uh her record so would you need to do is you need to talk to a tax preparation expert an enrolled agent a CPA someone with with tax a moderate that\nCan answer that question for you because it will also depend on her level of income and any tax bracket that she might be in and it will also apply to the state of Nebraska\nRichard if she's in Nebraska so you have some questions to ask\nBut I'm Glad you called one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that is or contact number one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one\nClear is on the line in Delaware clear it's your turn welcome\nHi can you hear me okay first of all\nYeah you sound great clear thinking\nGreat I have a question um I Am a stay at home mom I have a son and I I had been out of work I raised my children since two thousand and one\nSo it's my husband's income has the opportunity now to switch over to all the well to get a twelve or off for one I'm fifty eight I don't know if it makes sense\nFor seven years extra I'm Sorry to seven where the eight years ... uh you know if we if we do that we live in the lower income that we're taxed on now granted we put Fifteen Percent away so we would lose that however\nWe get a tax free in the end and\nI don't know what's the better business to make now\nWell what is your current tax breakfast bracket that benefit issue when you put it in the pre tax contributions what is your current and you have to include Delaware in there what's your current marginal rate\nYou know I I don't know I Would think when the at the lower maybe Fifteen thousand because by the time we\nPut away his what we do in this world want to bring in our income down probably around sixty thousand and then by the time you take out the the children's adoption and the standard adoption and the things I think it's down around it so I\nThink it's low\nSo you're you're thinking that the money that you're the pre tax money that you're contributing there's really not give you much of a benefit at all\nI guess it does because if not let's say that you know we're being hacked one eighty thousand income instead of maybe a I don't know let's say we put away Fifteen thousand a year I\nDon't know maybe that's what I look when you put it that way maybe we aren't getting that much of a benefit out of it\nWell it would be interesting to see the numbers and you want to throw Delaware in there too because you have a state income tax in Delaware as well\nUm I Know these things 'cause I was born and raised in Philadelphia not far from where you are\nSo I Would say that um you want to check out the numbers and see how they work", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018",
