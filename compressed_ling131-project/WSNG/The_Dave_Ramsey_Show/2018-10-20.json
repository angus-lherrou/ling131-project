News channel real news real honest opinion [noise]\nEnter alone welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone it's\nSerious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress\nAnd joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies are for those you may not know Dr paint is he is a nationally\nRecognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell [noise] you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a one a person's under stress the\nBody transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract\nAnd everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right ... and the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles get in the arteries\nOh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over in the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties ... and I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because\nThere are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress ... okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's\nIt's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired\nYour body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition of people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it\nHas to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does build your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nKnowing that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\n... wow and so one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones of ...\nThat's right I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a bomb\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of frozen nitrogen\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is not being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and a calcium supplements you know they buy the health food started writer right but these things don't absorb and the body it's time for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say on antacid that had the calcium in like a Tom's first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom isn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the\nThe antacid itself it's not been absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an as an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... formula\nI my comment formula natural\n... and the differences that isn't\nA powdered ... and what happens if you put it in hot water ... and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\n... and it absorbs into your system\nPowdered ... and what happens if you put it in hot water ... and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\n... and it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's the problem is\nWell yeah because when calcium and museum or a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fast absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing kept him take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need leap into the calcium\nAnd especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things I my comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment\n... well if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their bond\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing to do their little drift little leaks here and there and do what we have is a cumulative effect where a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time\nYeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nOr calcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles\nNeed them actually helps the translators and the nerve and when you take this ... formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I ... a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I Would functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both dietary early and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula ... and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\n... well ... the arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body to be in or near could beat her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was eighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more camp for me to even it out to her friends\nAnd that is amazing and when I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium and use them in the system is very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nGoes on for so it's really it's really a rat race and sounds like it's a vicious circle it sure is\nAnd we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah\nIt sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose [noise]\nIPhones again if you want to get
