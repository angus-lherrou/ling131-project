and your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were\nGoing to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that's the stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes the serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about it\nAnd we're told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress\nAnd joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr pink is this going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect of the daily stress has on our bodies ... for those you that may not know Dr pain 'cause he is a nationally\nRecognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns with Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for well [noise]\nYou know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right\nNow at a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the month of getting the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over in the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in the heart disease digestive difficulties ... and I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because\nThere are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress ... okay now according to research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep\nWhile you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it\nHas to do is not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many\nIn Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell ... yeah okay yeah and it does build your teeth but is the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nKnowing that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\n... wow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one is in the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorbent back from the bones if neither that's right I say and what\nYou just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a bomb\nNow and it's due to the bunny deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... yep okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nTo just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food started writer right but these things don't absorbing the body that's\nUp for a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in like a Tom's first of all calcium does not absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic\nEnvironment but see what happens when you take a Tom isn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the anti that itself is not being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an instant environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the count max formula\nI my comment formula natural ... and the differences that isn't a powder ... and what happens is you put it in hot water ... and you mix it up and you drink it down so\nFormula natural ... and the differences that isn't a powder or and what happens if you put it in hot water ... and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill or edit absorbed into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem as\nWell yeah because when Cal the many of them are in a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact I'm reading the can right now says a fast absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing them take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need leap into the calcium\nAnd especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things by my count that formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment\nProper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium and how much of an impact that\nHas on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing differences are little trips little leaks here and there\nAnd do what we have is a cumulative effect where a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nI don't you think is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nOr calcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I ... I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back ... and I was tried everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period yet it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula ... and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain ... well\n... the arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body being or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was eighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use is with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their mothers' we're in real relaxed shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and and the add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium and museum in the system so that very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them is also blocking further absorption something\nSo it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle it sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so\nIn further absorption something though it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle it sure is\nAnd we're you know what are you going to do so I Am I have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah
