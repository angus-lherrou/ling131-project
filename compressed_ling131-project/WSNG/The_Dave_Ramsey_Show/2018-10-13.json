today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress\nAnd joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr pink is this going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies are for those you that may not know Dr ... is a nationally\nRecognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris grades have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\n[noise] you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress\nOn the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nYour mother ended up can track and field that in their in their upper back in ...\nThey're more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles get in the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\n... and I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress ... okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired\nYour body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition of people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it\nHas to do with not how much calcium someone's taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nKnowing that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorbent back from the bones if neither that's right I say and what\nYou just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis\nRight which is a weakening of the bomb now and it's due to the bunny deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the Knight Tricia yep okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drugs are right but these Cal things don't absorb and the body it's time for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say on antacid that had the calcium in like a Tom's first of all calcium does not absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom distant antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an answered environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... formula\n... my comics formula it's natural ... and the differences that isn't a powder ... and what happens is you put it in hot water ... and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill ... and it absorbs into your system\nWow so that's a problem as well\nYeah because when calcium and museum or a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact I'm reading the can right now says a fast absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption ... one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium\nAnd especially the menu is being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things I my comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comments\nFormula ... but not like well well I feel better\nI have thousands of people are ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time in years\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick\nBut you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium in their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like a ... a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drift little leaks here and there and do what we have is\nAct where a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n... doctor bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nOr calcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles\nNeed them actually helps the translators and the nerve and when you take this ... formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back mhm and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I\nWas functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for about ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on his cow next formula ... and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\n... well ... the arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from five on my ... where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body to be in or near could beat her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize are really just as the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was eighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nSo that's amazing and when I use this with professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their mothers' we're in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and and the add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or\nHeart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system so that very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish in cows they make museum it's also blocking further absorption\nSomething so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle it sure is\nAnd we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose [noise]\nFolks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ...
