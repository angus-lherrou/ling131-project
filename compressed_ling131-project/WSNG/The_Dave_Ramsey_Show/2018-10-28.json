E. and north to Alaska on the dog is the program that helps you to learn how to become your own personal financial manager that way you\nCan take charge of your personal financial future\nWe talk about everything from investing in your tax privileged accounts to saving for all those important future goals including the education of the young sprouts and the way to get the job done has acquired the knowledge it is that knowledge that empowers view\nTo control your financial future that's what it's all about money talk the strategies are the tools to achieve that personal financial freedom for yourself and your family so that if you're not already there hopefully someday you can reside in that land of critical mass and T\nShirts you of your personal\nFinancial future\nAnd I think that um are a lot of ways to get the lead critical mass obviously time helps\nHelps a lot of time to reach that led to a critical mass the um there were a number of things you can do though to help you along the way we've talked about the one of my favorites\nIs paying yourself first which basically means that the first thing you're going to do every month to take care of yourself and your family by taking if you can afford to do so taking at least ten percent more if you could afford it but at least ... percent of your earnings\nAnd invest in a tax privilege program either at work or in your own business or an IRA whatever\nAnd there is a text there's definitely a tech privileged program that always would rank person this pecking order and that would be a four O. one K. with matching\n\nIf you have four one K. program that has a matching provisions that means that your employer has said years free money taking your job is to you know typically the way this might work at it varies\nBut if you have a matching program typically the made is the way this might work would be your employer would say that I Will match\nBut if you have a matching program typically the made this the way this might work would be your employer would say that I Will match\nUp to fifty percent\nOf the first six percent you put in your four one K. you might be lucky enough to have this sort of for three bay but\nGo to the bump Brinker dot com home page click on the request a complementary back issues feature and that's all there is to it right there as the home page that way you can take a look at the\nFormat see if uh it's of interest to you\nWe're going to the great case GMO radio Kansas City Dennis welcome\nI've been listening to you\nSaid I Want to get the money talks good to have you with us\nOh I've been listening to us and she was on twice a week in you'd still enjoy it all the time and uh\nYeah we still we still enjoy a dentist some thank you for continuing delicious we do appreciate your listenership\nIt out here a lot about retirement on there now and I'm Wondering I'm getting close to another couple of years and we've saved about we got about a million and a quarter in some of the money seven hundred of it is before tax money\nAnd the other is after tax and I'll have a pinch and I hope I'm about fifty seven thousand a year\nAnd we don't we don't need a lot to live on everything's paid for and I'm curious what would be your recommendation on\nA which way which money to take for the tax money or the non tax stuff that we've already pay tax on and then my last question I guess on that what you know he took the four percent like you talk about how many years will outlast with average returns on what's left\n[noise] well I think that ah it's helpful to understand how we get to that four percent number and that will give you a better picture of\nHow long it will last as you know I recommend having a year in advance set aside so you're never pressured into raising money in a downturn to take out your four percent\nWithdraw if you stay a year ahead I think that's helpful in that regard also\nTake a look at how the money is\nConfigured when we look at that four percent first of all we're looking at the total amount when we look at that so we would be looking at\nOn the one and a quarter you have we'd be looking at the potential to withdraw perhaps fifty thousand now if you don't need it you don't do it you take a lower rate if you don't need it sounds like you don't need it I think somebody like yourself I think would that pension that you have\nI think I'd be looking at a lower number I'd probably be looking at three percent and it sounds to me like if you took three percent which is still close to another forty thousand a year on top of your pension\nThat you'd be in a you'd be probably ...\nYeah it's more than I make working right now so I mean that's\nGood oh there you know I mean well I think if you go to three percent uh then I think you can basically\nReally in almost all the years I think you can do it just based on your dividends and interest I don't think you'd have to do a whole lot of share liquidation to get to three percent because he was the way we do it we do it based on the total return now the total return\nConsists of a four components first component is the interest because obviously as you know I Would be in a balanced portfolio posture\nAnd the kind of a lifestyle you're talking about showed the first thing I'm doing some generating interest on the income portion of the balanced portfolio so I have my interest income so I have that to add\nSo then my second component is going to be my dividends which are going to come in as a result of my\nFor example a mutual fund holdings\nAnd then the third component which is going to happen in some years would be capital gains distributions\nAnd then to fourth component only if necessary because the other three are already taxable even into personal account\n[noise] the other three are already taxable your interest your dividends capital gains your fourth component is going to be [noise]\nOnly if you have to share liquidation and I'll tell you what I think if you go to a three percent withdrawal given your hefty pension income and you're a you're a modest lifestyle [noise]\nI think at three percent withdraw\nGiven your hefty pension income and you're a you're a modest lifestyle [noise] I think at three percent withdrawal rate with all of the interest and dividends and capital gains accumulating you may find that that would be something that would uh almost never require you to liquidate\nOkay great it's kind of the area and good ...\nWell it's uh I'll tell you the most important thing to do when you get there in my opinion decide before you go there what you're going to do\nLike it's very very important to decide in advance and you may have to make some changes along the way after you do it but to to have some ideas some decent idea before you do it\nA lot of what you're going to do with your with your time I think that's extremely helpful they are all kinds of things you can do\nWith your time and I just think it makes sense to think about it I don't think it's a good idea\nTo just go home on the last day and a sit down and turn on the TV that's not going to work now not going to work especially especially given the content of what is on the boob tube these days so ah I I think as far as your other question where to take the money first I Do lean\nTo allowing your tax divert money to grow [noise] until you get into our empty ages and the reason is a reason is that the first attacks [noise]\nOh okay okay wire shaped Bob and the like I said hopefully it'll I I've been told that the hardest thing is spending money when you're retired you're afraid to you don't have a check company or anything you know so yeah there are a lot of people well I uh and I well\nI have good news for you Dennis and that is you've already done the hard part actually you've done the hard part which is I mean you are at the land a critical mass based on what you talked about so that's the hard part getting to the land a critical mass from Iran Iran cruise control Dennis\nOkay thanks a lot of at first she alright Joe\nGreat to hear from you\nYou can't straight money talk on your computer and download to your smartphone ... gone demand\nThat way you listen wherever you go whenever you light to light so many people do actually all over the world we have money thoughts are on demand subscribers that are able to listen to our broadcast on her own schedule and their own time zone as well as here in the u._s._a.\nSo you can sign up right there at Bob breaker dot com that the money talk on demand logo\nAnd of course we we used terminology here on the program that you don't often hear and I understand that and if you're a new listener writes we're not trying to lead you astray when we talk about the land a critical mass were simply talking about having enough money in your investment portfolio combined with any pension income you may have\nWhere you can do whatever you want with your time you own your time because you can live from your investment income and your other income other income being for example pension income\nSo in the case of Dennis Easter bunnies pension income and then combining his uh money that he would take from this investment portfolio we talked about an annual rate of withdraw in his case in Dennis this case it was a really conservative three percent\nBecause he is he's not a heavy spender and certainly doesn't sound like he's going to turn into one\nIn addition to that he's got fifty seven thousand dollar pension that he has earned through his hard work through his lifetime\nAnd so if he takes another three percent if he rakes off another three percent which is going to be mostly are almost entirely interest dividends and capital gains at that low withdraw rate he's going to have an annual income or a Ninety five thousand dollars a year is going a said he'll be a net saver\nBecause that's more than he is making now and these are living comfortably now so um when we talk about critical mass that's what we're talking about\n[noise] let's be honest we have you sir the expression critical mass from our brothers and sisters and the nuclear community and we have given it a financial life\nSustainability element\nOf financial critical mass I mean after all that's what it's all about think about it that's the point isn't it the point at which you have an investment portfolio where you can live off of the income for the rest of your life comfortably by properly diversifying your holdings\nThen you're there that's why you throw the alarm clocks out because you don't need 'em anymore because nobody else owns your time but you\nKnow if you want to set alarm clock to go fishing at four in the morning that's your business we're not talking about that\nOwns your time but you know if you want to set alarm clock to go fishing at four in the morning that's your business we're not talking about that we're talking about setting an alarm clock to get up to serve the man or whomever\n[noise] pulling your soul to the company store you know the whole the whole nine yards of ... there [noise]\nI'm a record this is

coated they will code you recount\nWhere the money that comes in in interest from\nInterest bearing and dividends from David in paying all of that money would be directly placed into a the the vanguard prime money market I Would recommend the vanguard prime money market the symbol is um is a Victor\nUh\nM. M. S. sex that would be Victor M Ms and money ... money Sierra X ray\nAnd would you be able to do is you direct all of the money coming in that way and the money market so that it would be available in liquid form\nFor any withdrawals that you make now I Would only do this if you're planning on making withdrawals out of that account now remember any any withdrawals that you make\nA prior to your ... your um mandated required minimum distribution any withdrawals that you make are voluntary and therefore you're voluntarily taking money out to pay tax on it\nAnd you have to ask yourself if you want to do that\nWell the only way I can take money out of it if I don't have the evidence being sent to the money market is to sell shares correct\nWell yeah but the ... yeah but I mean that's another thing you can do by the way it's not a big deal but a ... matter is I'd rather do it the other way I'd rather collect interest and dividends on the money put it in a money market fund to withdraw that way\nThat's what I intend to do as long as that meets my income needs per month and if I needed additional income for what\nAre you know when you have to talk with you know then I Would liquid then you have to lobby yeah ask ya\nOkay I think you've answered my question it's a and I and they do support that ... they they will put those dividends into a money market for\nI Believe that I Believe that that will I Will be that I think that'll be a simple matter of coding of code in your account appropriately\nYes I Believe that's correct All right Bob thank you very much for it thank you thanks for the call great to hear from [noise] Douglas welcome\nHi, Bob my question is are here with the stock since November two thousand seven paying the standard Poor's five hundred has advanced but since then it stopped and utility ATF have declined\nAnd my ... my question is can you see an end in sight it related to the bay the treasury interest rate\nAbsolutely a it is normal for rising interest rates to cause problems for utilities stocks and other interest sensitive investments that is a normal occurrence that is something that should be expected\nI also try your or vanguard gr frightened and that and in companies and they are not as sensitive to ah changes in interest rate\nAbsolutely not because first of all those are not going to be portfolios that are going to be dominated by utilities stock\nAbsolutely not because first of all those are not going to be portfolios that are going to be dominated by utilities stock second of all the growth and the stock market has totally overshadowed any other considerations and those portfolios have done fine\nI I understand that can I get some feedback concerning compound interest for younger listeners\nSure\nForty years ago I bought shares of utility and I never paid I've never bought any more shares but Iran and it does get a dance now twenty shares have grown to seven hundred shares\nGesture that compound interest by ruin that thing they did that and all those years\nNow how many years are we talking here we are forty three years Yes sir\nAnd how much did you initially invest\nIn that six hundred dollars\nAnd it was seven hundred shares are worth what five thousand greater than twenty five thousand today yeah\nWell you know what we call it and it's been called this many times compounding return is the eighth wonder of the world and Douglas you just provided more evidence\nAnd I think that's really important for young or listeners that they should have clinicians just like you preach and the stock market\nYou are so right Douglas and you know I really appreciate you're bringing this up and I'll tell you why you know I think we all encounter over the course of time we we encounter various ah advertisements and one of the advertisements that just drives me batty\nIs advertisements to de trade\nAdvertisements to constantly go in and out of the market these these are so damaging Douglas so damaging day by the way they are the opposite of what you're talking about\nI agree with you and thank you so much for taking my call\nAnd I did a great talking with you checking in from the south pole raise oh Indiana\nAnd then some of you know back in the day I was a Hoosier I was a Hoosier I worked in radio I worked in radio in\nJasper, Indiana\nThis is back in the day\nAnd uh I loved my time in Indiana what a fantastic place\nIncredible place\nLet's get Bill on the line and another former stomping ground of mine the commonwealth of Pennsylvania He is in Yorktown bill welcome\nYeah Hi, Bob no I'm In Yorktown, Virginia\nWho worked on a bridge India well we'll let your rank chalked it up to the uh uh to uh type up what's on your mind\nOkay uh I've been working since ah start ah starting with W.

pay off this awful loan from their point of view that they may do you the last thing in the world any bank wants is a two and seven eight percent mortgage or they have no interest in that at all\nBecause uh [laughter] uh it's not a good long for them great loan for you or I don't I don't\nReally understand this and here's one reason I don't understand that is because well look at it first of all you should be able to itemize your interest right right\nSo you get a tax benefit there and you're also paying back cheaper dollars every year even if you used to ... percent inflation your your bank to pay back keeper dollars every year the interest you're paying that is in in in devalued money because of two percent of ... or whatever the number\nOne seeds to me that a at a two and seven eighths rate I'm getting a tax deduction and I'm paying back cheaper dollars this is free money\nRight right I Know you're going to say that I just had to had to find out [noise]\nI mean I just ah I don't I don't know what I don't know exactly what you're feeling when you're feeling pressure uh you've got a eighty percent equity in your home\nAnd you have a a free money or if you do the accounting where's the pressure\nEighty percent equity in your home and you you have a free money or if you did the accounting where's the pressure\n[noise] well it's all about four percent thing and I'm fine there you know with the withdrawal I just want to get myself set ups that I just don't have any of these loose sense you know what I mean [noise] so no\nAh I don't know what what is the a monthly payment on this\nUm with taxes like twenty five seven hundred bucks and the\n... ... ... yeah well you're going to pay the taxes anyway if you can try and live there so a Fifteen hundred dollars raised what's your thing and you're getting a tax deduction you're paying back super dollars and what's your net worth um about three point four\n[laughter] so that does it does it I have no interest in this whatsoever you are on your own my friend your on your own I was not very much\nThank you Brett ...\nI'm Sorry I I'm not going to do it now where three point four million two and seven eight percent alone was seven years to go\nEighty percent equity in the home I'm not ... that alone with your money let alone mine no way no way in the world not going to happen forget about\nForget about\nIt gets your me on the line hello Jeremy\nHello Bob thanks very much for taking my call and I'm just calling I I've been reading an article the pension and other states being under funded and\nOne in in one instance or read a book helpers\nUm their pension went from people having a\nFifty thousand a year to twenty five thousand a year and I'm Wondering how that could even be possible someone could take away someone's pension I'm to that degree\nAnd if you see uh the uh the pension for other states continuing on down that line wondering if you first saw that happening nationwide and um it's so to what degree [noise]\nUm I'm a federal government employee myself and I have a a very small portion of my retirement and pension\nUm and I don't know if that would affect I'm a federal pensions\nWell let's talk about the difference okay first of all let's talk about the state pensions are right I don't think it follows that just because Illinois has had problems and just because other states may have had problems I don't think it follows that all fifty states are going to have the same problems [noise]\nAnd I'll tell you why because\nThere's something about this country that it takes a while to appreciate it takes experience and time to appreciate\nAnd that is that you have to you have to countries in the United states you have the United states of America which is the federal government you worked for that one country but then separate from that you have fifty countries\nWhich are the fifty states right yes\nI think about it they have their own um motor vehicle departments they have their own tax laws they have their own set of laws\nWe have fifty countries fifty separate countries represented by the fifty states that make up\nThe totality of the United states so we have one country in the United states in that sense although sometimes it's hard to it's hard to find that when you look at at the wrists and ... there's one country in that sense but they're also fifty countries that they're known as states do you agree\nYes sir they all have the all of those fifty states have their own fiscal peculiarities if you will some of them are strong some of those that these states are very well run\nAnd their AAA rated some of them\nSome of them are really badly run in fact you just named one of them\nSo uh what about one year ... at one you mentioned uh by the way I think\nHas a at a at a parade of governors go to the big house if I'm not mistaken\nSo I'm the bottom line and all of this is you have a lot of differences here and I do not believe that all fifty states have to go to financial ruin even though some of already led the way I agree with you some of already led the way\nSo I Would not be concerned that every single state is going to go down the drain from a financial standpoint that doesn't even matter to you because your pension is a federal pension right\nYes sir I only get thirty percent and the Seventy percent based off the a P S P ...\nBut it's all federal but it's not state it's all said\nYes I I understood\nAnd based off the uh the SP for savings plan\nBut it's all federal but it's not state it's all federal\n[noise] yes [noise] I understand where you're coming from routed you each each state being this basically his own country so if if the state or the country's poorly ran the pension plan could be possibly a poorly ran and then a could result in something like\nUh Illinois [noise]\nYeah I mean that's the way that's the way I look at it now I recognized we have the United states of America and that's one country\nBut I also recognize the obvious which is we have fifty countries represented by each state and they all have their own motor vehicle department they all have their own pension plan you all have their own laws in fact some of them have ah\nSome of them have thrown out the federal laws and put it in their own laws like look at these states that have made um recreational marijuana legal that's against the federal law right but they they put in their own law\nAnd if the federal government decides not to pursue it then there you go there we say this today and the number of states around the country so the bottom line than all of this is that you have a federal pension\nSo that your pension dollars are going to be a function of the willingness the ability and also the willingness of the federal government to pay your pension so far we have not seen federal pensions in jeopardy\nAnd there is a reason and that differentiates them from the other fifty state pension plans and that is\nThey have a printing press the fifty states don't have one federal government has a printing press the one country printing press US dollar they can print them and they do and as long as they can print them you're probably going to be okay with your federal bench\n[noise] that does not apply to anybody's state pension money talk is about getting yourself into a position [noise] met in your own personal financial [noise] that's what it's really a little bit from uh [noise]\n\nThis is the money to [noise]\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the first\nWell I think there are a I don't like that can uh let me tell you why don't like the comparison nobody's ever lost the nickel nobody's ever lost a nickel in a in a fully insured balance by the FDIC or a day of a perfect record of paying off everybody with uninsured\nAmount up to the insurance limit and I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because\nIn the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earned was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on a get a ... a good point\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay a\nOkay you've answered my question\nThey Rob appreciate the call great to hear from Lincoln I knew someone who um had a family member and immediate family member who are in a very very nice pension working for a company for many many years and the company went bankrupt\nAnd when the company went bankrupt the pension obligation was turned over to the pension benefits guarantee corporation and I was told that the amount of money that was received was\nDifferent less than the amount that would have been paid under the original pension obligation of the company that went bankrupt so these things do happen\nAnd are these are corporate pensions snow the difference of course when you start telling you about federal pensions as I mentioned earlier we had a caller on that and in that case in federal pension they do have the printing press\nNow the difference of course when you start telling you about federal pensions as I mentioned earlier we had to call her on that and in that case in federal pension they do have the printing press and the behind their obligations and\nThey're not bashful about using it so that's a plus if you have a federal pension if you have a state pension they don't have a printing press so if you have a state pension you are dependent on the ability of that state to manage their affairs in such a way that they can pay the pension obligations now keep in mind\nThat one of the important aspects of the state paying off tensions as cash flow that depends on taxpayers paying taxes is at stake offers so it's important for states to remain a\nA viable and to have a healthy relationship with their tax payers so they can collect those revenues going forward the last thing in the world you want this was the last thing in the world you want\nMake a note on this one put a marker on this one the last thing you want is to have a high level of state pension obligations and liabilities\nAnd have taxpayers leaving your state that is the makings of a fiscal train wreck\nState has high patch has a high pension liabilities\nHigh future pension payouts and has a population that on net is leaving the state that's a disaster new making right there Ellen's on the line in Illinois hello Ellen\nI tell my trick that I don't think they ever get straight answers\nWhat I did back when rates were very high\nI by individual getting married at seven point five percent now their\nAmount of like three thousand thousand seven thousand laughed at me from getting in trouble but every time they go up the market value goes down to I like your lifestyle then\nHow much do have invested in these\nTwenty thousand thirty\nAnd what is your network what is your net worth\nA million I\nTwenty to thirty thousand or the million dollar net worth in this situation keep in mind that you are collecting interest at a high rate on a regular basis correct correct for that reason I Would simply hold on to these\nBattering twenty twenty\nWell here's the reality they're paying you a very very high level of interest correct correct and if you do sell them you're going to have to reinvest that money at much much lower interest rates you're going to be get way lower rates correct\nCorrect what's the point of that\nWell see I didn't know what the market value with you or I couldn't get it\nWell the market the market value on these is going to degrade as interest rates go up just as it has been at the same time if you sell these which you can do your then going to have to ah reinvest that money and you're going to get a really low interest rate at today's rates\nNow I go\nSo in other words in other words for you you can hold on to them and looked at him on a total returned basis you're getting ridiculously high rates of interest\nWhy anybody would hold onto a mortgage at eight percent or seven and a half or said the only reason they would do it is because they don't have the money to pay it off that's the only reason they would do it\nAnd you're benefiting from that by collecting that interest at the same time if you sell these and reinvest look at what you're going to get\nWhat ... I don't read very low right right that's and I thought well maybe\nI mean what would you what would you do if you were ... let's just do a hypothetical let's say you were to sell these which you can do you could sell them let's say you sell them what would you do with the money\nI'd have to agree with that ... had reinvest that money is\nTo take money out of Jenny Maes to put it in the stock market that's a totally different question but if you take a look right now what's out there fully insured FDIC insured CDs their yielding two and a half percent\nSo I I think what's going to happen to you is if you sell these and I don't even know that these are in a taxable account you may even have to pay a capital gain on a principle appreciation sounds like you would\nPlease and I don't even know if these are in a taxable account you may even have to pay a capital gain\nOn a principle appreciation sounds like you would\nIn taxable to count you might have a capital gain liability for the for the federal government maybe also for Illinois [noise] so I mean I think you're going to find a you're going to find either way\nIt's going to be very very difficult to come out measurably ahead meaningfully ahead but especially because this represents such a tiny portion of your network\nRight well that that ran it here and I couldn't get it straight answer it you couldn't believe it\nOkay I just don't see a big deal one way or the other ...\nAnd I appreciate it so much because I couldn't get it straight night night I just quit way ahead of a broker the bank and the ... and everything so thank you so much\nNicer polio and good to hear from you know I mean it's always complicated when you're talking about Jenny Maes is even more complicated when your own Jenny Maes paying you eight percent interest [laughter] I mean that's a big rig right that's a really big rate\nAnd ah it collecting a tremendous amount of interest relative to what's out there are not very competitive doing eight percent and you may even if the prices degrading patios on the line in California Patty welcome to the program\nTaking my call now and I'll see you investor and I can get in on purchasing that John ... but you recommend um I'm fine but I just read your new your market timer guy very interesting um learn you know I\nBut I Would start investing and I'm sure mark became a model ... every yeah I'm going to be gay and I think maybe that\nLet me ask you a question let me ask you a question Patty you mentioned a a really good book by John Bogle which is on our recommended reading list in the book section above Brinker dot com one of my favorites is called common sense on the actual funds congratulations on getting that book but I wanted to ask you have you read the book\nKids I think maybe the first second chapter only I was actually I bought it I'm listening to it I listen to it at night ... he just started\nI'm going to ask you I'm going to ask before you start investing I'm going to ask you to complete the book\nWonderful I can do that and I love it already is great yeah the patient\nAnd it just everything you bring it on Google John Bogle has been a multiple times just on the broadcast or John Bogle is one of the best things that ever happened to investors\nCorey while I'm excited I Love I Love it already and all that I often get my helmet and I received a very wide and okay so I think I in in that model or you know quite how are you in that that might be that\nWell the way you would invest in a again I really want you to complete that book before you start but uh the ... the way you invest is uh you can notice for example that a lot of those funds or One Fund family", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "28"}
