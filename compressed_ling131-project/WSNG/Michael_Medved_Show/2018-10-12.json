because of the terrorists and agriculture well\nAnd and that's it uh there are I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the

to the polls in November yeah ... it's really it's only\nWhen you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sci fi and the map\nOr for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats or another we're likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight ... for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the top ... district still remains at thirty two and a two yes\nI Would love to see what your district that was a that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up but from the Democrats so I'll go back and

congressional races out there\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well ... ...\nAre a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well ... and I\nI guess historically tend to shift happened ah with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nBy the recent polls that were done in that race\nUh the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us\nA margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to put it ... it's not a toss up [noise]\nThat's my point\nMy point is that it's our cp has the does definitely blue\n... I'm\nOn my map is still showing great it's just one great\n...
