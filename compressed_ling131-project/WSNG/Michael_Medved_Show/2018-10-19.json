a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd they soon as they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from was um uh what do you call that acting um sac\nCity island but he went to school for acting thing still doing it [laughter] I guess\nYou're acting you thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing and now the official prime minister Ali\nBoy it makes you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the lady will ridges mail anymore daughters sisters a son it it just doesn't seem to matter how\n... how do we ever win elections well I guess we're just finding the people that that won't talk to us and the friend is so we don't get you know the people that are so I wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call and wouldn't be that fair to you\nBut I'll tell you this ... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging\nOh I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you\nBut I'll tell you this ... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my news were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend that I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member MacArthur was you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers is that what it's come to an let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I\nAm a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservative talk show hosts are some liberals were most of them are not\nA ... you know what ... what what kind of America to we have in twenty eight tea and when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for video road lot\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas there'll be a little strange today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today\nAnd tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday\nFor the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today high pressure from the east and west coast a medal mean clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast also the deep south will be mainly dry today\nMark how're you doing well good good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it as having all the relationships friends family\nColleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit things ... five years ago because I just couldn't take reading\nSome of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought\nI don't want to jump in you know and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on things but how I felt you know uh back when Obama was still president and\nIt just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of a relationship you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously\nAnd was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right or if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me\nOr you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that but I've learned to like you kind of indicated\nI've learned not to say much about politics or the ... when they know the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know try to\nSee all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad and I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general or I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nThat that does some good but the uh like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked and they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart usage you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nA little mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I our our list do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything there is a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that\nThe U.S electorate we're going to do its best to not get the candidate that the media was trying to ... and that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of\nIn a day that the media was trying to and us and that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came\nOff of ah of Paul Kennedy and I'm a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green\nOr all of that probably helped a jet or Obama\nOr get a Trump elected\nBecause it was trying to hurt for when we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd ah but the reason I called was so we'd already been told a for\nYour Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected you know we're just mandate anywhere\nClear off on another change and things got worse or we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review just pointed at it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nWell I think if they voted for him because they want the show they were in prejudice that was a mistake you know a color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is that he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out I or not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill heirs and who is the Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know and they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that for the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer to hide that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him probably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar I've got to admit that\nAh people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark a I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make\nA first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem that we went through liberal friends and then also when this country\nWas founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise and the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country\nWhich specifically states that we have powers\nAre as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nYou said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is an example of antifa but they're fascist themselves\nThey when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what does this group think what does that group I think uh they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives\nSo I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and they they care about my minorities\nAnd they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the ... Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he'd six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm more\nThe important they might have been let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine of seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark eyes are on red Iranian\n... radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nRight now at the ... and Petro stopping centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions is on sale for only sixty four Ninety setting\nThe tough tested powers led is on the road the ... will be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and\nNational retailers across the U.S stay tuned to run I radio for up to date information and be sure to follow red eye radio and talked tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter for information on tour stop and promotion if you see this ... take a picture posted on Instagram and be injured when great prices at hashtags\nTack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you\nKnow truckers quick question for you how do you see in her chain when you're not on the road some drivers watch DVDs on lab job so there's just bring a book on their home some people even resorted trucks Doug ... no thank you me I like to one line to the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab\n... portable satellite antennas it's easier than ever mounted on your roof are still I'm Still your day is over then just shut them up in your sleep or gas being a ... wage shut up and minutes and don't require allies like in a shit load it gets even butter\nWould do if there is no longer TV contract dish things you're go programming you pay for only the ... actually huge check it out at ... for my truck\nJohn gum beds fleet owners want to give your truckers the comfort of home on the road is ... is perfect\nFor college to older TV you love to watch at home in the comfort of your cab\nAnd you won't have to put up with trucks Doug GV and over again find out more desperate mud drug Dutch gum today restrictions apply\nThose is a truck and he goes by the handle midnight\nWho specializes in the graveyard shift the lives of the night with conflicts 'cause he's protesting about progress in commercial into his truck ... and I'm actually he doesn't have a daughter who just want to mention the rest are hotdogs", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "19"}
