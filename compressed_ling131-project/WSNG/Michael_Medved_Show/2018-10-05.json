executive summary late last night of the FBI supplemental background report and a into a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAccording to the summary released by the Republican committee majority FBI agents interviewed ten people and reached out to eleven focusing only on witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by cabinet and\nThe FBI provided to the Senate twelve detailed thrilled to reports summarizing their interviews with the witnesses\nAs well as supporting materials sudden by the witnesses during their interviews among those question where mark judge PJ Smith Leland Kaiser the three individuals Christine Ford claimed were president when Kavanaugh allegedly through or on the bed and sexually assaulted her some time in the Nineteen eighties\nUh ... all three of those individuals had already provided statements to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of ... of a felony denied any knowledge of the alleged assault Kaiser Ford's\nLifelong best friend or denied ever knowing Kavanaugh when questioned about Kaiser statement at last Thursday's hearing Ford suggested Kaiser was having serious medical issues and had apologized for her denial or a judge was also questioned extensively about other allegations\nAre besides for the FBI also interviewed to individuals' names in Kavanaugh's ... calendar entry which some observers said could have described the gathering where she was purportedly attack\nThose individuals where his longtime friend Christopher Garrett and Timothy ... whose house cabinet went to for beers according to his calendar an attorney for one of those witnesses was also interviewed finally the FBI interviewed Deborah mirrors the woman who claimed\nIn an explosive New Yorker piece of Kavanaugh had exposed himself or to her at a Yale party the FBI also interviewed to alleged eyewitnesses identified by mirrors and tried to interview with third but that individual refused to cooperate agents also interviewed one of ... close friends\nFrom college the supplemental background check investigation confirms what the Senate Judiciary committee concluded after its investigation there is no cooperation of the allegations made by Dr Ford or ms ... district committed Republicans wrote\nVery ...\nAnd they went after people I remember ... forty different people for them to talk to her twenty would ever was right and the FBI said don't only people that you claim were their first hand knowledge\nOr say doesn't count right\nSo tell us you know tell us who was there who you claim was there will interviewed those people that had first hand you claim have first hand knowledge we're going with your claims you tell us right\nNow did you know cooperation right for either ...\nOr or for it so interesting to know that that's what that is what it has come out in the summary well what's interesting\nIs that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering in this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details\nIn those three oh two reports a secret and can be viewed only by a hundred people or\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more [noise]\nTo this investigation in other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and Ramirez [noise] and ... that summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically\nI I think in part works to the effect of as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to get some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check and the fact of the matter is you're not going to you're only going to interview\nPeople with first hand knowledge or people that were said\nTo have had first hand knowledge or anyone else isn't going to be included in that process the point being [noise] the leftist screaming all day long\n[noise] anyone else is going to be included in that process the point being [noise] the left the screaming all day long on Thursday which was predictable and we said it was going to happen this is something that you know that that uh this was a cover up that that's the words they were using as a cover up no it's not\nBecause ... doctor who's right now tell me [noise]\nWho won this scenario because if it's true or is hiding it from the Washington Post [noise] you say it's a cover up [noise] who's hiding evidence who's hiding evidence that they couldn't call the the New York times and the New York times would put it on the front page tomorrow\n[noise] tell me who [noise] is being\nCovered up Dr for his lawyers Dr Ford in her lawyers were holding evidence right that they claim cooperate her story\nRight and it's not in the media already for video road log

central plains so\nA fourth one used to talk to the FBI that was on ...\nOn a on forward we we told you that they interviewed everybody that she had stated mhm she stated nobody knew and so they re interviewed all the people again just to make sure and a few new people\nNo direct cooperation of anything happening right so there's a we are but I Want to play this year from a Tucker Carlson on a with a fires should care or the American civil liberties union national political director they put out an ad where they had\nThe Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby yeah it's a terrible\n... ... ... and let's put it this way any it'd be a show you ran that ad against a private citizen they'd be sued for millions of\nDollars a there is no even\n\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore that they're not\nAbout civil liberties that but don't believe in the presumption of innocence but I just want to play a part of the interview that went back and forth because it gets to the point of being in sane remember the American civil liberties union what are they what why were they created to defend people's individual\nRights [noise] to protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused the presumption of innocence is always\nThe ... the number one thing that evidence is one determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect people's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\n[laughter] this is a disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is that you ran it because this is guilt by association the very thing the ACLU ... stood against ring for instance the blacklist period\nBill Cosby and Brett Kavanaugh have nothing in common and you and your twin them in order to discredit capping off how could you do that as he is ...\n... ... your comments Tucker the common thread here of course as powerful men whose careers are on the line issuing denials about sexual wrongdoing\nAnd innocence and simply believe that the denial issued by Brett Kavanaugh goes right to integrity of position that he's apply foreign stuff on the Supreme Court and what she said send judgment on the rest of the nation integrity is on the critical importance the most important thing about about him not that\nGreat I I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity but Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes\nIn court and when he says is alive is the one that the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like new ones defended Brett Kavanaugh has not been so toning them together is by definition guilt by association and unfair do you think that the person you're positioned Twenty years ago would have seen that\nThis isn't a similar criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job for ... assessment when I'm making the standard of proof hairs how to bring me on a reasonable doubt so then why don't you get an axe to rebuild constantly who has been tried and can get here is not entitled to the presumption of innocence that view is host assume that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job I'm ... I'm I'm not sure what am I hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking you why you put them next to a man who was tried in court and conviction of felonies and sentenced to prison because if they notice how does\nBut I'm next to a man who was tried in court and convicted of felonies and sentenced to prison because that when they voted on than any of those things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate Tucker that we're criticizing people on the left and I don't care about the left in the right I care about the participants to make the country was when she wants to it and now you\nYou're right on man\nSexual assaults and to be taken very seriously here Tucker and I think that we're all an crowding out the voices of women and believing that man and not believing women in this case this woman came forward on they're not around certain circumstances here ... years ... you're the ACLU\nYou don't believe in collective judgment or collective punishment and we've lived long enough to remind you believe 'cause I think I Know more about your organization or any of that happening a lot of the nation\nBecause an individualized determination about this woman who can't or die honestly ... thinking that you're that can reasonable mode so why would you say it's about women being heard when of course a snow in one wasn't making one allegation against one man San jose ... says there haven't been other men who have denied accusations then ...\nThat we've said and all we're saying is that in this instance like in previous and says women deserve an opportunity but at the ceiling her about hold on so when you were in door saying\nCollective judgment and collaborative John or the man that she had heart\nWould always do other women have nothing to do with that\nSort of the deaths around again it's half an hour is on the merits of the issues against Kavanaugh has not been honest and forthright Tucker I Believe that that had he come forward and said listen all of us who are young at some point in life we now you're getting is getting ready for as he asked me what I Want to let me let me ask you have something that I've wanted to know he's a long time\nThe ACLU is the reason that the first amendment was defined in the clearance Brandenburg versus Ohio case of Nineteen sixty seven he was a coins men and you guys defended his right to speak and that's why I have the right to say what I think is true the it was now decided they're not gonna offend anybody they disagree with\nNo sir I mean we have ... we are defending right now they have the money you know at low were define a\nWindow unit was about ... do you want me to name another group but out here on the weekend would have to do and the whole night with people on different ideological AC here in Norman either grew to ... more than I Am trying to shut down because you know I'm trying to think my principal and\nThe ... when he was a little this memo from the your group\nWe're not going to assist in cases that may advance the goals of white supremacists or others whose views are contrary to our values if you're not defending people who are unpopular who disagree with why do you still exist we absolutely defend the people we are doing is that right around and look at the\n... case in New York or were defending the we look at what I have ... yeah I mean [laughter]\nSo it was known it was done at that point [laughter]\nRight well because they they do draw the line and they are political organization learned just let it go where no longer the ... and ... and he read remember when they they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend people that don't show they were saying about right hope at\nThem you didn't you bloated completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech but\nAgain as we've said all along on this issue there had been so many\n... off shoot arguments that have nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute we judge this case in our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier [noise]\nBecause somebody else has been sexually assaulted does not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters\nIs the evidence to back up her allegation that's it mhm [noise] it doesn't matter that other women had been a a a criminally sexually abused just like if somebody was making the allegation that they were robbed or somebody else who was Rob does not have a\nGreater morality or greater credibility\nTo judge that particular issue which judged on the evidence that exist [noise] [noise] [noise] and that alone right that's what it that's the only thing that you can go buy in the system and the ACLU is now saying to hell with that right [noise] because no other case counts\nNo other criminal case counts no other victims [noise]\nOpinions carry more credibility just because of their victims it is the evidence and every particular case that counts otherwise anyone can make the claim and\nYou're saying we believe the survivors and you'll be have like ... ... ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Torrington", "day": "05"}
