[laughter] uh\nYeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah ... this out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal lawyer excuse me Michael I have an end to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress\nAbout Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\n\nThat would be interesting to see where a case like that would go ... right\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that I honestly\nAt that that warrants an investigation I'd say\n... ... here's here's the question what if anything happens\nTo it after the midterm assuming like the house\nTakes control or does it does an investigation like this go with it\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what would pursue a a a a refer I I\nI Would have to look at everything that Grassley has but here's your rights here in light of missed wet next and Mr ... own statements to the media information obtained from ...\nThe look at everything the Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of missed what Nixon Mr ... his own statements to the media information obtained from committee interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the committee likely contain material false claims Grassley wrote him a letter Russia's across does not guarantee of Justice Department will open an investigation\nIs the last part of that and well send he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher\nWray right now\nBecause\nIf the if the committee words to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen to them that they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate\nYou send to a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for prosecutorial means if you found that there was a wrongdoing if you through the investigation your own investigation from\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape ... right right right\n[noise] and then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement ... so it's not like you\nKnow it's not like the uh the the the house\nAnd their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or document\nYou have things in a sworn statements that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and\nThis that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire to pursue justice year oh that this will be the Senate's I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that while at the end it goes back to that political will I think again\nNo one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses on\nThe the if the ...\nThe tearing down and the shredding or the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process we know that that was the you know the the hearings what we're about Dr Ford but this work was at\nA this was adding to a an intended to influence the the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh confirmation vote on Kavanaugh or it was part of that entire you know process well some separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process so [noise] when you talk about doing the doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute\nOr shred the process\nIn the ... just then then\nI don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an investment\nWhen we had the left come out and said look this isn't a trial this isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial then and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is\nYour under oh mhm if you commit perjury mhm ... in you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury ... is that is against\nThe law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right\nAs we said it's different than a criminal trial but as a political trial that has similarities you are put under oh and\nSo the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley has going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence he has I don't know if anybody came forward after\nIt I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the Grassley had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes that he can make that case for making false statements based based on what she said\nBased on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because it is\nA it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens 'cause that's what it was that none of\nThe law should be followed at all\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was that none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it\nIf you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up till line should you go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question\nAnd kept the you know kept the case out of the vast majority of Americans would say yes well because it is it was an attempt\nI think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do\nWas disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nA boat giving false testimony\nA sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is part of the process and if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here was to disrupt that process\nAnd new knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statements\nThat were falls I don't know\nWhy you wouldn't move for well what whether they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice which is under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does this\nReally is at this point isn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no\n... or ... ... so\nYou know my question on the on the house things is that soften the political will it's not about political will really eight six six\nNinety run I had
