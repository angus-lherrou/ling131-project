when they dismantle the protocols of due process of\nA they say it's just a job interview or whatever they call it that dismantling affects all of our other institutions whether it's you know kicking out a little league coach or saying the teacher in ... in schools should be fired or your neighbor uh shouldn't have shot a gun on where you are how all those disputes when they even then when they don't reach\nA level of criminal a status nevertheless there are ... on the spirit of the constitution and these guys for the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual so\nWell when we when we see the few moments of honesty from the Democrats are when they really talk I'm candidly it's about the fifth vote on the corner it's not about whether Brent did this or whether they're\nAnd none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have\nA he never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nFor I mean [noise] yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there in that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after when ... I Believe that a wise Latina makes better decisions in a white male they didn't go scour and say you're a racist and we're going to stop your they didn't go after a lane at Kagan's or early college years\nAnd they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they try to use protocol use majority status\nBut they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote that's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal bow they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's taking down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they went out there that's that's\nA progressive idea that the noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know it's also interesting I I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white or but listen to this um tower of intellect I'm Donny Deutsch than MSNBC lecture let's listen\nNow for an entire generation women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way but typically post that capital performance that as a man I was in Dallas for him he was leaving ultimate display of of white title met\nThe man who made his money or in part by opening up you know the our NPR from selling selling snake on all the people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way and self Donny Deutsch for\nI think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that\nThey've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being devoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class not classics using the race or gender\nThen you have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's being\nWho's running against like Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color and the same thing is true\nOf Chuck Schumer and the same things through Coons there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal in the white guy but they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because\nThey're liberal and they're joining this new way but there are also doing it out of fear because they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory true you get all these other people say\nOr white guy old white guy old white guy even when they and\nThey're all like they're all old white guys\nIt's back to the end of the progressive idea that you have Andrew McCabe that you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exempt shoe from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his house and all these old white guys have privilege if he really believed only Dorie she would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV\nLet's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities in the world that you\nHave a lot of that that would make me very happy very happy and he'd\nHappens don't expect it now\nUh the we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that a woman has to be represented on public boards in uh\nIn California there has to be female representation on public points at which point at which point I tweeted out the Pacific islanders all Latino isn't a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be all of these boards when there and that's where all the decisions are made and so they want to mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be a Jew will Judy Kate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed and percentage fashion of the population\nThan there are so many different tribes with claims of victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're going to have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be on the border because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white\nTherefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves\nYou know set aside on the sport or we're going down there and I don't know what the ultimate project for years but either people would say you know what\nIt is getting chaotic when we go to stop this and go back to the melting pot just look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan\nYeah well I think again it it says all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good to\nPractice identity politics but you see this even in in the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hop or by Kanye West he he's the guy who has some God I mean I don't really agree with us and\nI don't like his music and\nI I'm not here not my not my cup of tea but talk about breed going out on stage on ... ... s Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive entertainment\nAnd wearing a make America great again hat standing on stage and this is how it went down\nYou know there's a [noise] whoa\nInvite all\n[noise] [noise] oh\nI Can't hear an airplane that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food you got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump so the last two will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP\nLow unemployment means that people who are Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage and they have worth\nAnd that's a kind of a revolutionary messy so what else\nThan others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that will be patronize wide government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics we always have to have the after its identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're west\nDoesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison 'em and you're charged with sexual assault\nWell it doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's most cases or gender or your race you have to have the proper raise the proper gender but you also have a ... have to have the proper ideology\nAnd they were almost that time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and they in group thing thing all the rage I mean how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how does it had a ... regular people stand up to this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Torrington", "day": "01"}
