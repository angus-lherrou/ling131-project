is ah is righteous so to speak no matter how I'm a dishonest and even criminal it might actually be let's go to John in New York on line to John welcome to the program\nWe're on the air um I\nI like you to answer a question for me and I know that when you work did you have your you get more of it why isn't Dianne Feinstein a doctor for word and Maxine Waters I\nI think they should be arrested and have to defend ourselves for what they did and I think that it would be easy to charge them under the RICO Act\nOr I think it would be hard [laughter] you know I I I think what they did is reprehensible but I don't see is a basis there for a for criminal prosecution and I think it's a precedent that we as conservatives should be should be slow to set because we will not always be in the majority\nLet's go to Jenny in Indiana on line one Jenny welcome to the program\nI think you know I I decided that I think you are absolutely right about carbon on her by the whole circus ended with the group from um however I also think that we as conservative in the back off a little bit I think she was had\nSomething that didn't happen to her and her life and I think he was ... years um but in fact I think that um we are contributing back on her with that because I think we're not making friends like that on that point that I Am a grilled a camera adverb ever their investments for him\nUm and I don't agree with him that I went through a form of not true and went on to comment on that you\nWill you and you're absolutely right that was used Jenny and I think I think the the Republican politicians have been very gentle\nAnd their treatment of ah Christine for what I think is that it is important to point out how false her story was not because we're interested in in pounding away on her but because it was the Democrats who procured\nThat false false testimony evidence seems to me that the\nThe target here is the is the Democrats we are up against a a heartbreak uh so I'm not going to take any more calls right now\nWe'll take more later in the program after the break we're going to be joined by Heather McDonald who is the author of a a brand new\nA book uh called the diversity delusion which actually fits in quite well with the things we've already been talking about today so we'll run to a break and returned with Heather ... a\n\nShe decided was rape in order to take revenge on her a partner after\nEight months after the fact she decided was rape in order to take revenge on her a partner after immediately after she sent loving farming text messages you know Paul\nI Want to see you you you I Love you we need to get together for another Paul and the ...\nAh this is not the text of a female who has just gone through the most traumatic\nTerrifying experience anyone can have shorter being murdered a this is somebody who you know wants to continue or sluggish involvement with this guy a and and we have other examples of that a girl who uh conspired to evade or friends in order to go have sex\nWith this guy that she'd been making out with um during a dorm party she sent a message saying do you have a condom\nIs on the liberal Heather let's just pause on this for a second this is an accidental college Southern California and and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking beer news\nAnd and this this girl Dodgers her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said\nOne of the things she Texas okay do you have a condom and he replies yes and she text back\nGood yummy two minutes since so you know the capital silos and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reason and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is going to show me as willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trust with this con demise guy uh she sent the message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now\nSo and these guys that receives these messages is going to perfectly rationally an accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college who is under enormous pressure from the Obama administration wanted to rack\nUp as many male scouts as possible in its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh occidental expelled the guy he's now\nHe's sued the school of that case is yet to be heard but the text message trail is is completely a vindicate shipment and exonerated sim\nYeah yeah there's another one you're talking about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being\nAs being rape or she checks to the to the boy how we're I'm sure the boy checks to her how do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies your grades [laughter] and then of course after the fact she says though I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes\nAs I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nCompletely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses\nFirst survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at this magazine a forty three percent of the females whom they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I\nSubmit to you that that is behavior that is\nCompletely in on thing couple if you have actually been raped you are that is the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily\nHave next again and and the the key to this whole whole hope is that the numbers that we have\nOn a ledge campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves this same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine when the researcher asks\nThe girls who she classified as rape victims whether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the the the phony campus rape epidemic a conceit depends on it violating\nOne of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet\nHearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she hasn't been raped\nFeminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she hasn't been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou don't have this this this couple of things going on here one is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly\nExpand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape isn't that big combine that with this with this idea they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing\nThat any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask whether it matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe\nAnd and as you may know whether I spent forty years in the courtroom okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh most witnesses or don't lie and almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie\nBut but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd and I was this video allergy that somehow women are are you know camped are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nWell again let's let's go to remember where the city elegy is coming from it is coming from the campuses and it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization it is based on the idea that\nThat America in general and college campuses in particular are places of endemic racism and sexism\nThat the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive world the victim world it is a ruthlessly competitive totem pole\nThat is constantly being rearranged we thought that maybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top but they they're put decision there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's gonna cut claim top dog victims status but\nBut females you know we started there early on and and they claim that they are victims\nOf rate of sexism this is for posture as it is it is for postures particularly on college campuses\nWitches are open to everybody where females are encouraged from from the time the girl is five years old today on where she is the in incessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women in stem\nGirls code ah encourage ... right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys who are in the afterthought who are bombarded with the message that they are at the ... they are the perpetrators of massive\nOppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic\nMasculinity at some point males are just going to check out entirely because we are now a culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them\nUh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is is the value but as you said the court room\nYou know the reason that we that the western tradition developed these truth finding mechanisms like cross examination was\nWith the understanding that human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very\nHard to remember things there's implanted memory syndrome that we know about\nYou know we don't know what this Christine Ford what her therapist\nWas doing to her ...\nTherapists these days are very left wing who knows you know [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThing happened whatsoever\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a ... and I think it was probably an eye opener to a lot of people who haven't been following closely the phenomena that you describe other on college campuses it kinda burst into public view here was the accusations against a judge Kavanaugh a\nBut just as the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if if if you've got a child going off to college uh you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself\nAnd and the rest of us have to realize don't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is\nInstead of us have to realize don't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating the victim ideology
