these midterms are going to be about Kavanaugh and the caravan\nHe's likely not wrong it's no secret the Republican base is motivated by a legal immigration and I've been saying for weeks now that the cabinet confirmation hearing all weekend is an angry silent majority that the left is not anticipating\nHe's not wrong but at what cost the president of the United states as using immigrant families fleeing violence and pain synch it up hair among his base would cost to basic chemistry of the\n[noise]\nOnly in a kind of liberal la la land would they think immigration is just a Republican issue that affects the poor just proportionately in the United states that affects middle income earners disproportionately in the United states the rich people don't get affected by it [noise]\nThey enforce their borders believe me they enforce their their uh parameters [noise] they have cameras they have their sensors they have their\nAlerts on their phones that if a deer walking walks into their property and they get an alert on their phone so it doesn't affect them at all\nBut it is a big issue for the rest of the country\nYou're listening to the lower income show eight five five forty Laura remember the facts we brought you\nA last week about\nBlack voters and Hispanic voters in the last CBS a year\nBlack\nVoters and Hispanic voters in the last CBS a Hugo poll on this which was in June kind of at the height of the family crossings family separation issue\nOf the workers that were poll by the CBS poll forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters\nEach said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community fifty five fifty eight percent of white voters said the same thing sixty seven percent of Republicans sixty one percent of independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters a said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels that is a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five\nPercent said the levels should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a corner of what we allow in legally now\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that makes them a majority at least fifty percent\nUh they want to cut of all at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally see most people just don't know if people you know in the country doing other things maybe they're not listening to the show they're not they're not on these topics but suddenly they say why\nThings seem to be changing around here I mean now you have to let you have to know Spanish to get certain jobs in certain industries\nBy the way one of the guys they interviewed on the ah\nThe thing I tweeted out last night the LA Times article that that's in the LA Times today one of the guys the interview said well I ... I expect to be getting a job in construction very soon of course why ... unscrupulous builders hire people coming to the United states who claim they have a skill\nAnd who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut you think you're getting like this great these great artisans were coming in and doing like the craftsmen building oh please\nGive me a break [laughter] I'm not calling in a caravan any longer a book but Bob Bob Bob Let's go to Mike line to Mike real quick ten seconds\nOr you know um when you just talked about on the African American conservative but when you just talked about African Americans are super or your your legal immigrants these jobs are African Americans used to do our cricket oval by legal immigrants\nAnd and we look for the Trump for their\nWell good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get to coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\n\nAll\n\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there was a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and that you're going about is a long way if they want to seek political asylum there is a process for doing that\nAnd we know that it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent they talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in the ... that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexican can make certain that the border is secure into the air protecting their sovereignty book cause\nThis is not something that you know people entering by force is not something that we should\nView as being unacceptable process\nThis is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen to the podium\nYou as being unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo opponents whose first thing is you know big numbers are very personal way of looking at the world's Uber's very good at it [laughter] I just tell people that's what I was I'm not for God [noise]\nYou've got a choice is as you want to move things forward makes a compromise is try to get some solutions for immigration healthcare and all these big issues of it was one of them will be real pleased rivers on people's honestly one more to\nOh here's a had eight years of Obama what did they do the math of our healthcare system and we did catch in early August so what does he talking about\nWell you know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continued to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace family freedom has an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's\nSovereign Kate and protecting our borders securing that southern border\nWas in my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one thousand\nIllegal aliens he they tend to see a hate crime for illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but yes it's the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them those certificates and I believe we need to end all of a sanctuary city policies I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so brightest would be somebody there at the border welcoming damned them giving them\nA state issued id and of course we have the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so\nSaid well I stand firm on this anti let's make certain that these caravans now they cannot just come walking and our country and receiving benefits Tennessee and want to see us to deal with gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human drive tractors and secure that border\nWell again we're getting reports from\nRural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down in South West Virginia or illegal immigrants there are again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nOr and this undermines us a worker or of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond fed up with us and how it has to stop\nA the armrest one Blackburn what what would you ah in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about but there's there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nNo you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up and it that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is in executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting that money on a timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know are you going to like why does work anybody that doubts that don't talk to Israel lungs work\nAnd what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat are not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met when say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by an illegal alien who had had several\nYou know ... who had had several run ins with law enforcement and of course her daughter is a dead she is retiring this grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not\nIt's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do you verify the employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar pay a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him and his sons to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior no totally is\nAnd and then he and his sons go in and do it\nRight but he said you know getting into these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their Mason green business in in gear to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and what I Will tell you this I think when people look to the immigration issue they see it as a security issue not having the border secured\nEvery child support or to them every state supporters said and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed to me and my grandson tough on crime tough on trafficking truck on tough\nOn the drug issue the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see it as an issue that affects them in their community against the law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community safe\nAnd again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on the Laura Ingraham show we've hit the issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans\nAre leading by a record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in his mid term cycle of that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them including on trade and all of the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll\nA congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused\nTax cuts pick on China get more manufacturing home and it's working\nWell it is working and I'm not a fan of tariffs ... fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what is going to end up happening with China\nBut here's the thing China has had a trade war on us for decades\nCongress on how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so\nWhat they will say is if we're in a war\nWe got to be sure we win this war and it that is what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price or that is tough on China they than stealing our intellectual property they'd than reverse engineering is that you have been taking American Jobs and I were owners will say okay\nWe get it but we've got to have some great leaflets be sure we win this trade or and that we open up markets today are encouraged by the U.S him CIA they don't encourage that the EU is structuring their agreement and that's a cable with talks now", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "22"}
