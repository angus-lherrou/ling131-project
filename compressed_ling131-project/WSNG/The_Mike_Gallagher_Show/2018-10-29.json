in Florida many are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida's trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy Andrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax\nIncrease that I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved which require consultation with the federal government or if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime\nThey've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee when he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in Tallahassee history and I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because\nAt the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked\nLaw enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders in sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow a ... a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate\nReelection the Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about the allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\nBomb I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for for Andrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise want to vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me\nI'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak when it comes to the ... regime in Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down\nAnd don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first uh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so\nYou know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas um you know that put the race away for cat and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWe'll give them as a silver Tunde order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about\nAbout about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested how he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen to my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\n\nMissile defenses has spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling this the dissenters races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the our our lovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today a there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boycott honors of Israel these anti\nIsraeli organization supporting Gillum the ... and you know he ... sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers\nAre of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum\nHow do you respond [noise] so yeah\nLike I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values Andrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott\nDivest and sanction of the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they have special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not\nA flash mob protests in Israel they have special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so his way out of step on that\nUm and I would never accept an endorsement from a group or that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement as racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined that so that's what he said\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago\nNew Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner and of course that's the FBI are aging as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but when a Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nFrom us right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer\nAnd then it comes out just a couple of days ago but that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote an almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain Nathan governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so it goes around saying that he's not been investigated and being investigated but I Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have\nFor Greece in his palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting of pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating do not be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith the laser Palestine but I ... down to some really simple in these last closing days as sleazy\nThis is sleazy politics as usual\nBribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politician jump and they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurants it's sleazy corrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida than definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states then you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa\nI endorsed Ron over a year ago because I saw his leadership in his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled it's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not it is it's pathetic and by the way\nA Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nI heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you've got you have diagram that sends\nA but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better thirty eight percent said now impacts thirty six percent\nSaid it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants in the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help us kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want him to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the uh care about\nThis is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border and the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance to the nearest refuge they've they've rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to over on a boat or border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states as running mate was out there saying yesterday\nRight over our ... our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate with out there saying yesterday\nAnd we need to welcome in the Caribbean and to the United states um and so you couldn't have a more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke open
