have a a wholesale invasion of the United states is going to keep going [noise]\nMore and more and more and then you have all these we the reports on MSNBC they don't do the Wi Fi reports on the victims of violent crime by legal immigrants they don't do those stories but they do the ... story south of the border of all these people are sitting on the concrete with their kids playing with you know a paper doll\n... and you the people are supposed to have your heartstrings completely uh polled by the emotional manipulation of the American media [noise] they're emotionally manipulating [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI Can't stand that time kind of reporting it's the easiest kind of reporting to do and it's the most dishonest\n[noise] let's go to a ball and Virginia very quickly Paul ...\nGrow the wall is going to go down as Trump's you keep your doctor ... he's done nothing on the border here here failed miserably\nI don't care about Korea or trade deals or anything he let this continue on this country is not we're never going to get anybody elected you're going to have the Elizabeth Warren\nAnd the brokers and everybody'd be elected in this country he is killing his country by not stopping I have to put the military on the other side of the border and stop that [noise]\nWell I think a lot of people agree with you and you see these you see this massive invasion imagine if the people who claimed to be reporters were actually reporting on this like really reporting on it not just talking to the the the Seventeen year old who has two or three kids is a poor person I get that they're desperate people I Do understand\nWe ... we feel for the people who are being manipulated and hurt into making this track but we are Americans first we must must protect our border otherwise adios America\n\nIn the state of Georgia which is considered kind of a purple state these days\nI think motivating a party's base uh what do you expect to happen in the state of Georgia which is considered kind of a purple state these days\nYeah it's a key race\nStacey Abrams has received a lot of outside money a lot of outside attention she's become a darling of the left and you just heard right there she is truly a progressive candidate saying we welcome undocumented of voters people who aren't legally allowed to vote in this country to come out and my rates I mean that's just not something that we should be\nUm accepting as citizens and she's also saying I'm going to raise your taxes abolish ice all the things that the left as putting forward and it's a frightening prospect for the people of Georgia a Brian Kemp would be a much better choice and\nHe does have a slim lead and I'm hoping he will pull it out\nWell I think again this is about the future of America a we have Elizabeth Warren of course the great progressive savior and the Democratic party are coming out today with the DNA test a where she claims that she does have\nAncestry a of a Native American sort a initially\nReports were that she could be one thirty seconds Native American but now there's a there's a there's now a Boston Globe a question about whether it's really like one one thousand given the math of how far removed her\nNative American ancestry could be yeah here it goes the report includes the possibility that she's just one one thousand twenty fourth Native American they just put that correction on the Boston Globe store\n[noise] yeah I mean I'll tell you one thing she is a hundred percent not qualified to be our president where she would take our country is frightening\nA and it's interesting to see that she's running for Senate in Massachusetts this signals to the people of Massachusetts as clearly as possible she's running for president so she's saying here give me another term as senator but I'm going to go run for president and walk away from the Senate seat as quickly as possible so um I\nWould love for the president to go up against Elizabeth I can't think of a better contrast bring it on\nThe ... or ... by this joke and if you if you say you\nYou know your part Austrian and and goes back ten generations you get to claim nobility status and the Austrian author of Hungarian empire I mean is this is this really what we're going to do now to get special privileges in colleges and universities I think this is what drives people crazy\nAnd it's offensive to Native Americans I mean it just is so ... and she doesn't apologize to them for you know capitalizing on their true heritage for her her benefit and and that's really the\nBottom line of that says that she's push that forward for benefit for her career for her education and what she's one one thousand\nEvery [laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny but Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before he took off for Florida let's listen\nTo\nYour other reasons to get\nA ... no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it because Democrats keep saying free health care free this free everything and they're not\nSaying this well quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the\nHouse looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but did anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like\nIn this midterm election cycle with the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like the ... the he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data\nObviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did in twenty sixteen to turn out our vote to educate voters to talk about the results I there's a lot of house races and the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be\nNeck and neck I think until election day I think that every town\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is is breaking our way ah in North Dakota and Missouri I was in Indiana this weekend with my ...
