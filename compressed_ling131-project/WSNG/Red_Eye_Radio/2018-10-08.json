exploitation of the electoral college over a period of time and now that Brett Kavanaugh has\nBeen confirmed and is now he's Supreme Court justice the next call was coming out and I was waiting for you and I talked about this before because you said we we had said if you've been listening to the show for a while you know for the last couple of years we've been saying if the left truly wishes to get rid\nOf the electoral college in the next step ... was to get rid of the Senate\nThere you go yeah yeah you can ... a reporter at NBC News\n... ah over the weekend on Saturday\nIt may not happen in our lifetimes but the idea that North Dakota and New York get the same representation in the Senate has to change senators representing less than half of the U.S we're about to Burma nominee opposed by most Americans [noise] oh I don't know if\nThat's true because I saw the poll but was across America that showed a that or if the FBI did the investigation that's sixty percent of Americans are in favor so I'm right well\nAnd I guess they're doing it on the population of the states represented the yes okay are they getting a vote okay I'm being those fifty senators in this case so then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states right\nOh that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that

Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the rise of for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about what the work and\nAnd and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work\nThere and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates 'em by\nThe end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to\nThat that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right\nUh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to swallow debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA ... whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend\nTrump and his peck yeah because if you are defending his pick your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech [noise] yeah\nAnd and except for ... really are ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass\nAnd the big pass which she shouldn't have done because Dianne\nFeinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and just say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and ah but the fact\nIs Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump a heck of Brett\nKavanaugh um ... you know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to uh uh get done as\nA Republican or Republican his party right now is a pretty big party ... are pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is as many when you come when it comes to\nSpending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while a more constitutions listen they'd been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past\nAh ah right now and you know and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party as I said last week I like I Can't remember when we had\nShut unity part of it is the fight [noise] uh from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric but in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them\nAnd you know even you know going after sections as you're still goes after them as he did others\nEarly on made you think OK doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know ... ... ... ...\nLindsey Graham to still be on the Sunday Morning news show same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah\nRight ... ... you know and that's it because that's where the effort has to be we can still have\nThe discussions within a the right on issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and\nMaine great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now as to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but\nAgain that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media\nAnd in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nFor her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly often on the left they are better than the right\nAt ... letting the uh mansions of the world [noise] and even maybe a high camp\nUh uh do what they do in their state ... because it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically\nOn Capitol Hill of [noise] building building the wall really if you if you think about it\nThat guards guards this nation against the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there\nThey believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate and we\nPredicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in the way with the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't before they know that it's not going to have\nYou know it's nothing but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which gamble never happen they are willing to do and\nAnd work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution you can get a few things done if you're not unified\nBut I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified\nOver the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm In a very easy presumption of innocence quite due process constitutional issues\nNot defending somebody when you talk about those were all huge Lee moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty and\nGet legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative and hopefully give Trump a chance to win and twenty twenty against state\nYeah Camilla Harrison Ford Booker right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got

the Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday some we'll hear\nFrom him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if uh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says\nSpecially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer ah and\nAh you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nOf women who made allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go through the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate\nTo get rid of 'em so he's on the Supreme Court and he's on the Supreme Court state and\nThere's nothing the Democrats can do to do it they there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it and if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's only really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be isn't a motivator to get Republicans\nOut or is this ... because we can we we've seen it I probably in the past I Can't think offhand up of of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once that happens it's like okay we got this and then\nIt seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here and a unity remember you had\nA significant portion of the Republican Party that was ... and and I don't believe this is just about capital I think it is about the fact that you have\nThe as I've said why'd I think it will Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as social is a quarter an app\nAnd democratic about a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is a ... right now\nAnd ... and the anger and the unity comes from the fact\nThat they listen to a Democrat Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee that are talking insane ...\nThey're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important just so many of us are presumption of ... of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nWe begin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge rainfall wind impacts\nContinue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrived by tomorrow night from an area basically from west of Tallahassee\nThere is a tough call on in the New York times today that the attacks you I Want to put some about Frank Bruni writes I Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged approach from\nUps equally ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general your response or\nFrank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy a judicial candidates whose conservative whether it be Thomas lido more now Kavanaugh\nExcept [noise] uh I Try to have a good disposition costs I like my job but don't mistake that I don't care about the conservative cause so fat in age you upset because how well not generalize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina\nWell\nThe thing is is that ah I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I\nI think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through and that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah the matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows\nWhat kinds of other nomination process we may go through a wild Trump's to president but uh you know making some very solid point or the left was\nGoing to you know they used to him when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment a that that counters the president the left one do you use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was\nAnd in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bernie's come the New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and what he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact\nThat Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean to him and called him names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore [laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean I didn't change that really doesn't get\nWhat we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump ... it really wasn't a bully doesn't get that and I don't know I I'd have to go back on and and count the number of comments\nMade for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day\nOr a week ago last Thursday it was based on\nThe lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger a much to a larger than a pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside\nLook the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to read the article he's got\nNothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said we discuss this for the last\nTwo and a half weeks\nDidn't have any one I Am not seen any rational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nAre just saying that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar ... in this particular case to Lindsey Graham\n... where is flawed at all except for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process\nWith the witnesses and the allegations of came forward every\nSingle point that we had made which are the same one I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and\nRice and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni talked about the actual things that Lindsey Graham\nBrought up a gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that\nBecause then you'd be the line\n\nYeah I mean it is again a\nThe they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate Canada debates aunt that by the end ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well they used to be for drunk now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell from their world absolute\nLoyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this older right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this real people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham got and I might in the future now you're running for attorney general right [laughter]\nI Wonder if you've got one of your general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have\nAs he was against Trump and now he's for Trump\nWe're we've said with these simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple and arguments because they never directly go after\nThe the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't [noise] aren't even a\nPertinent to what you're discussing right [noise]\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing from spot to become attorney general yeah\nYou know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n[noise] yeah it it it is the insanity of the lab and and again uh they ... well it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect [noise] [laughter]\nThat's going to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is\nWell he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes Trump debate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight

because I agree with you guys are going to continue to hit on this guy um but I think that if\nJudge were super slander or libel oh\nHe's a private citizen ... not under the same rules of capping off now or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who as they\nBrought in it would slow them down I think that we give them food food for thought\nThat I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further um maybe there's something there maybe there's the they've already heard from judge at or and or is lawyers\nBut certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the link to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you\nThe names were brought out as a result of the leak forward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case in ... by ...\nBy mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible for getting his name out there and that you could see I think ... part of that in the oven any case that was that was him yes you added ... eliminate because I think like the ... of the gang\nRape that yes you're right that's clear yet right\nRight right they only possibility of backlash when I'm ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy or do they already the wind is yeah yeah you got to problems and I wouldn't want them to think that they're ... as he's joined us in spite of using his buddy to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every predictable and even some uh unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question ah he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process a new you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as a captain Kavanaugh did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of 'em are judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that has that survived at all was Dr forge claim and\nAnd it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nI Am and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so yeah he wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... yeah to me that would even be a\n... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor or I'm just using right that that is a possible exception\nTo me that would even be a ... and and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor or why not just using right that that as a possible\nException here right up but with the other case to me that's clear that what I mean it go in going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it and you're being accused of a gang\nRape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and rent that\nRight in saying that about people right especially private citizens mhm because then you got to make your case and say where's the probable cause well I think that might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so and they could just do ... personally [noise]\nI haven't actually asked them directly I don't believe they did it but I have not asked them if they did directly let's go to Gary in sparks Nevada Gary urine rather radio walk into the show\nYou how are you going to get his um the Republicans they keep complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody is like for for perjury\nOr Hillary Clinton or a guy and find sent and so on it's like telling a a a bank robber I'm complaining about it though well ... we're not going to handle\nWhoa whoa where's the perjury hardy approved the perjury\nHow do you prove the perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one how 'bout Dianne Feinstein\nOkay well I Know I but I might add another ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you\nCharge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein was that was she has a spy or a as a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have done during their promise I ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge really kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nThat one ... that's ... that's followed and I want you to that wasn't Republicans fault now\nAnd that was the only guy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats to stop doing any of\nThese now with I don't know what they\nGet them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss it is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up of these items up\nOn Capitol Hill because we said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about bin ... which wasn't ended up itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see\nWhat exactly what we've said is that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and\nThe whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted we said well what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail\nIs not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to when we were talking to the last\nCaller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private\nCitizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened but he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not\nGo to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness\nStating she's lying about it right uh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm I'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of of carrots\nOr it was you know about you know I I don't I'm I'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character but when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm\nUh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury\nAbsolutely sure uh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate and so we don't know what she what you want your it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't or when the seats that they should be winning a in a\nFirst term of a president in the first midterm afterwards\n... that's almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed ... uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party\nSo it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans do if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view\nThe most important things to get the truth out there\nI guess that's what I Want I Want transparency\nI Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton was never charged is because there is a majority there's probably half of America even if\nThey knew she was guilty wouldn't want to charge right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion and it doesn't matter\nWhether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know of some\nOf his bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure relapse when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins gives me you're the one the ... and ... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them a law that Hillary Clinton broke\nRight there you could read the law and and everybody wouldn't agreement that is what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best\nThat we can hope for in any thing is that the truth is told and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right I don't know if it's going to show corruption and now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIsn't when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and\nUh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make a ... my ... we're going to go to Michael Horowitz\nFrom my daughter of a democracy is moving around them and they don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went to ... ... doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general of the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nA wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's gonna happen there but get is a true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing that's\nThem and that's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it\nThe whole Russians scandal thing we said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as it is\nScandal thing we said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\n\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can\nNot even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house or do they really really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories\nWere slowly sometimes rapidly falling apart because this this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOnes over
