I don't remember us\nIn any segment today saying what you claim that we said\nWell I Believe they're dead about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the ... you got all the answers\nAnd I'll make is John John John John slum we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYou know I made about law and the last ... or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could get you on that because I pointed out uh with you know Kavanaugh and Gorsuch you have to construction and you're\nRight on the ... or ...\nThat right and and and when we want we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch of look at Obama most of what Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you use executive orders from uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well\n... and here's the thing

percent we're going to\nWe're going to take it to one eighty five percent\nI remember I almost right away what we need to raise if we need to raise it to twenty five percent black eyed ... who was the

to step in the way of private sector or you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads bridges\nPersonal review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those sorts ... from the a P\nRight you know so it's just because [noise] the problem is is with with\nIf you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information\nMisleading information is going to be out there than it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review\nYeah there's been so what does that oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all I can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you\nWrite I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh it's not what the sun was Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with 'em down there was harm you know along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that that\nThe narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day\nIf not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it and that's what I told you as an earth are saying the bomb was harmless this is in our ... not on the air and then realized\nOh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence in Associated Press separates the two yes and then says pipe bomb not again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask\nAnd the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were active\nBombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone on a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever or were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have\nGone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare ... ... or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent pray political statement would be the next question that you would ask\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the device of this must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't add the fact [noise] they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the\nPerson or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nA bright well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know been trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective\nNano sources of so they believe it's the same\nRight people are ... person or group of people based on the area which again that that the number of the number of of ah devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised that the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\nYeah if you look at the nature of or how this was said\nYou solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\nYeah if you look at the nature of or how this was said uh the the packaging the ... if you look at the um\nThe the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN or ed you know the multiple stamps\nIt went through USGS um each of these by the way\n... depending on who they are\nEven Soros has his own private security go through\nYou know he doesn't open his own male\nUh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but but of course with ah the the Clintons that's the case the secret service actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't\nDoesn't it's not delivered you know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a\nGreat deal of resources the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle or there's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having\nCameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were these were sent from oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bombs or not they know they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go on and could have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in in Illinois is there a reason that you ... I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they were\nArmed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city ah right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time to but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so\nDoes that tell us anything about the threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices\nWill find out in the coming days you know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building you know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have\nAs ex presidents do a secret service detail and\nThey're always going to have that a great level of security ah but if it's if you're talking about you know the media you have to assume right that the if the threat is real now that we're at that device word dangerous or we're\nReady to go off that there you would expect that there might be more uh possibly in the system somewhere um\nBut I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on you would just know that you've got\nA ... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to and and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on\nOn ah online and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here\nThey're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was [laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation suspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it\nAnd when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety right I\nWas ... and regardless it's raining [noise]\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell well tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three now\n[noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell really tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tell us what matters is inside\nTo learn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself and fears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today I donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's truckers won dot org ... band together for a better tomorrow\nProfessional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month job opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hub right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nBind truckers connection and job opportunities free at metros troubled centers of America we'll post and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just got\nWBRC am a WBRC F.

hit yesterday was a bear of a day\nYeah yeah yeah down over six hundred points\nSo ah the you know here's the other side of I guess and\nNot a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on uh with the suspicious packages and everything but you or the administration and they're they're probably looking at those going okay as we go in and get what are you know again twelve days\nOut from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return uh some of that a positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week\nIf that has to happen but you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs so the material costs especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on ... remember also the the I Believe\nCereal costs especially with steel\nAnd aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on ... but I don't remember also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming in and tell them that that is actually sign right ... or whatever it is the new now than they do now and we're not calling now [laughter]\nUh but as far as an end so housing has gone up you know we look at there is an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred days it's pretty bad gets you jak a and the rate of construction ... every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are\nTotally asking why why is it going so slow is the labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major ... apartment developer in North Dallas\nFor video roadblock here is your forecast wet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part\nOf the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes and that system will sweep as far back\nAs the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend\nUh exist that being said the care of them currently moving from ah the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration an issue of the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo\nWe've been saying for years and this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week\nAs well they have to be positioned very clearly\nThe question has to be asked where do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement\nDo support\nWhat you don't use the word comprehensive ... ... ...\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support as we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but\nThat's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner and\nGo after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have this comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means\nOr what does that mean specifically what do you want and he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes\nHere in the future must go back ...\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last\nThirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and looked at this yesterday and the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss\nWas a I was a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five but just\nIf they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do what with their plan B ... thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding ... every\nPlan B thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration\nIt should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation Democrats\nWide open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issue them the challenge and that's what it was shown insane here that\nAgain they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't ... they\nSome of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that\nAnd there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country\nAre black and Hispanic ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration\nIts minorities the vast majority of them those huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat ... you\nKnow the American people stand with the president on border enforcement or they do\nHe's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you know the president wants you know with the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back\nThem against the wall so they have no choice to either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull ... we're going to poll aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need\nTo start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people\n\nBut you need to embrace a free markets you need to you need to do something\nIf\nOther ways also we when we talked about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunger and flag ... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to\nThings that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point though how can you have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nI won't go after they're part of the party that endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who\nA bell to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage isn't a crazy Democrat or a says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of\nIllegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration\nAnd actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration\nInto this country look you have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest they you're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say\nThey should be forced to say because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback\nIf they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting his Chuck Schumer promoting\nNancy Pelosi\nOr they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we're you know there might be one or two maybe ... ... ... you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what\nWe want\nBecause that's the official political battle how can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration\nAnd border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party to promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate right right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do with right now with the caravan

packages that were similar in appearance and for the return address\nOf an office for representative debris Wasserman Schultz Florida the packages\nWere address to George Soros Hillary Clinton of a former president Barack Obama former CIA director John Brennan a pair of CNN\nAnd former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible that additional packages were mailed to other locations uh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full\nStrength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces we will continue to work to identify an arrest Weber is responsible for sending these packages\nWe ask anyone who may have been formation to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group\nCould be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland water set in a statement\nThat the Capitol police are told her that her Washington DC office was a targeted based suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI\nLate Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was evacuated after employees found a suspicious package which

the bomb they're not saying that both were harm right now they're saying the powder\nWas homeless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nOn that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw

know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of [noise] the the bomb experts that Ron well here's what it looks like still doesn't tell us the facts or what it appears to be and what might be or what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people that cry that the you know there are

October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the misery scout that has all the up by ... one in that\nAs a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and\nUh than the Missouri scout that has all the up by ... one in that\nAs a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about\nUh this radio ad is what is said in it where there's\nYou'll hear two women talking and they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting per cent of race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they'd be gorgeous why not that he\nDrinks ready why he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours you're probably a salaried workers we just did you stay a salaried employee is uh yeah uh but\nOne of those it's it's it's a horrible attempt I hate the contrived to all Judy Bob what are you thinking in terms of your vote\nIt's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people who are the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\nWhat am I I Will set it at all I mean if if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that\nAt a uh it was terrorists and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we we brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to\nHelp them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that\nAd it was terrorists twice here's Ian just interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri [noise]\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think they'd have any idea what they were in a nation where Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry and and and that is the case in in food farm states or even\nIf you're not a farmer or you know what to do whatever they ... yeah right wow you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth uh making that point ah which you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works er here within two weeks\nIt's a\n... I I think the most notable point is the word crazy [noise] yeah because it is it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of\nOthers in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her [noise] you hurt her saying she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters [noise] she's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we've pointed out over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high\nRanking members of the party that she's referring to here ... ... in terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know uh you know with\nMy my party in it no so I approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation and say well she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't\nShe's it was the term as you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat\nAnd ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be poets\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad where's the momentum ... they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her\nThat's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right ... idea what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back to their polling is the independents that\nThey're they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats from I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not a you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is is\nA term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream even if you will term\nWord right ah\nBut this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing [noise] is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not [noise] a Cory Booker [noise] or it doesn't matter that you're not a\n... a lizard with war and or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\n\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have\nA couple of times it's because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their\nActions [noise] go outside of their state or in terms of the race right they will change the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's or maybe one or two but\nThis this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so [noise]\nThat's the effect is that come out one Harris or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them [noise]\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the state of\nMissouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point uh come out with Harris or you know as side with as young crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as having us [laughter]\nAnd which is the perfect example and that's the thing that endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here is\nThat is likely that action yes one action we've talked about it before the ...\n... where does she go on this well she made the choice to go out\nBecause she didn't want to lose those Democrats are states that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips you know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats than it doesn't matter of the people in the middle\nAre going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as\nOne of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she condones that behavioral Lenny we saw during the ... Kevin improv\nAnd and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about you know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show\n... we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent who is looked at\nThe cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for her you know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back\nThat ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the lame that we will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat\nAnd with that vote on Kavanaugh ... that was also condoning their behavior him not you know all of that that's the that's the evidence to back up their opinion you have to come in to that conclusion yes habit I'll just prove that\nIs not you know all of that that's the that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion yes I have it all just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nGot my yours was guilty of active Ira and regardless of what our radio [noise]\n\nPreserving metro stop in center city almost half\nOf all drivers spend an hour or more and looking for parking it's easy to spend hard earned dollars at a time and few searching for that elusive spot in the stress a safe place to park his or something you should have\nTo worry about reserve it can help reservist foster the truck smart asked for online reserve it parking ... senators now pay for parking with Belgium wanted to point conditions the ultimate reward\nTruckers quick question for you how do you say entertained when you're not on the road some joggers watch DVDs on lab job so there's just bring a book on their home some people even resorted trucks dub TV or spotty lifeline no thank you me I like to one line to the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab\nAnd would do is portable satellite antennas it's easier than ever mounted to your roof are still until your day is over then just shut them up\nIn your sleep are gonna be a ... wage set up an minutes don't require a lifeguard connection loaded gets even", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "28"}
