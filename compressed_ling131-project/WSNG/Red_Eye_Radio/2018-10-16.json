one thing that I tried to explain to folks is\nWe might not have been a overly or a supportive of a ... we we we even have this like a government but the one thing we never get it and I ever get\nNever saw any one burn a flag how'd I probably would have spoke up but the one thing we did not do\nAnd we never ever ever saw anyone burn a flag ... will go up but the one thing we did not do was among the ... we didn't like the remote but we didn't have a hung jury\nYep and and that's a significant it's certainly changed that way or that so many people here on the left\nDo not like a murder or what America stands for that's why I said you're bumper sticker wouldn't fool the left and uh they got a real problem with a flag right that people are in that the protest in Portland people with a flag were trying to the prayer group that's what I was the phrase I was looking for\nAnd then they try to save the American flag because of the ... was burning\nSo there are people out there

I'm not going to go over to gain the he's done a fantastic job and I want to talk about the last caller um I you know I'd rather clarified differences sometimes asking her she was a Democrat that when\nWe finished with her saying that\nShe had some issue about sexual assault and she had no corroborating witnesses\nAnd my point was well it's all I didn't get a chance for hitting the break it's pretty sad I didn't get a chance to say that her but\nIf there are no witnesses you can't do anything otherwise people could accuse all the time like a ... I was going to measure we didn't get that yet you know Stormy Daniels a lost and he's he's a lawyer and he brought up a sweat and a girl I Can't even if that's her name\nAnd she thought what did she accused him of the you know they were part of this gang rape or at least they were there and it was so officers they actually hurt the case then the other ... case for its case against a judge Kavanaugh because it you start getting ridiculous accusations so\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those who didn't hear it in the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no cooperating evidence against the judge and that's that's the way to sometimes you you know when you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand how you guys like President Trump and\nThey're trying to narrow down to find out what she didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that and I'm going to predict now a that Mahler is not going to come up with anything\nDamon it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that\nAnd I'm going to predict now or the ... not going to come up with anything on collusion and the only thing left now is obstruction of justice and even that doesn't seem likely and then she you know she mentioned the thing I Wish I had her on to you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty and something to do with clues and but they weren't they had nothing to do with collusion\nOr whether it's Michael Flynn horror Manafort there was other stuff and ... cases are really egregious because\nOf the FBI interviews him he doesn't even have a lawyer with him and they get them on line to the FBI which is a great point I Would never\nOne out of your own pick owner I think the whole thing no I'm not up here uh well I'm not I'm\nNot afraid to pick on her but at the point I was going to make as many people say they go into psychology because they've had their own issues and then that would make much I can make money on this as well\nLike all of us should be struck just [laughter] we we are\nIn our own way Thanks David it's recall let's go I like this or because of what it says here let's go to Kim and burden Illinois I liked his Trump is giving us hope again\nHi Mark how are you Hi Kim how're you doing\nI'm ... I'm I just want to say um I listen to the young lady that called in so I don't take that she's just a Democrat\nI took it she says socialist Democrat and how they want they want to have 'em\nAnd they don't believe in global isn't where do they think that we're going to get the money to pay for their basic universal income to free college how the the health care uh that Alexander ... a casino Cortez from New Jersey yeah she wants to Medicare for all\nAnd oh yeah and she wants Medicare for all and they've proven that would cause says thirty two trillion in ten years I just want to say that\nAnd I'll Try to keep the short and I got lots of colors but I was a I one of those deplorable forgot and people who love my country the constitution my freedom my life and my liberty my ability to be anything or do what I Want and I was a former Democrat but\nI'm from the old Democrats that my grandparents my parents and her but he grew up in\nThose are not here around her any more I think all the children the millennium and stuff are the ones that don't understand that the history of our country they need to go back and see how many people died\nTo get their rights to them that they have a ... today and they don't have any idea and I just wanted to say Trump I had no help in the last ... especially the last four years of Obama and\nWhen Trump got elected I cried because for once I have nothing I'm about ready to get a leaked it out of my apartment\nI I hurt myself and I have no job that Trump gives me hope he he loves this country there should be no one mission doubt that that man takes it takes one dollar a year he had his whole life has and put on hold for the whole world to see and he don't have to do this\nThat man loves our country and he is sticking up for the rights and I don't care between\nYeah sometimes it gets a little bit of argument but that's his way of talking to us directly you don't have the the news media can't go on and try to twist their minds but I Love this man and I'm back in a hundred percent\nA thousand percent any day and we got to get out and vote because we cannot let them take over our country and that's how I wanted to say thank you very much for grading\nAnd and I want to say to you can never give up if you don't give up you'll you'll find that you'll recovery resources and do better 'cause that's what this country provides eight six six Ninety red eyes same thing's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine mark I start feeling in on road I radio\nWe would always told me for six weeks [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning I'm Wondering am central it's the free minor runs from our dollar on red eye radio tuned to help you more efficiently brought you by freight Weiner drugs\nIs stopping center almost half of all drivers spend an hour or more looking for parking diseases it's been hard earned dollars in time and searching for that elusive spot in distress safely support something you should have to worry about reserve it can\nHard earned dollars in China and searching for that elusive spy Kansas stress a safe place to park his or something you should have\nTo worry about reserve it can help reservist foster the truck smart as foreign line reserve it parking peace of mind at ... senators now pay for parking with Belgium orange coin conditions supply and the only one rewarded outcome\nResults may vary notice solicitation for legal services to view oh the IRS back taxes payroll taxes for them not filed you return the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients settles for about ten percent of what his old we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred and Seventy seven zero for three three\nYou have your driving right now and you'd like to read the informative and entertaining content found in the current September October issue of rotating magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of votes your drivers is downloadable for free as an F.

ultimate solution but it's a deterrent or most of our federal buildings in sensitive areas have fences walls up around them to keep people out um you know there's gated communities and if there were so ineffective why are we wasting money on\nThat and the rich celebrities in ah in my neck of the woods here in Los Angeles Beverly Hills and so on are right than ... why did they doing right why does

Berlin Wall sure worked for quite a long time I mean like you said the Israelis ... build the wall is protecting them uh you know there hasn't really been that many walls actually built around the

World War two of the budget but I'm\nAll around the world is going on\nYeah the\nEntire you ... you had a chance to express your point of view are you left that World War one you're left a World War two yeah left out the Korean War you know you won may disagree about particular wars but I don't think it makes you a warmonger just because you understand that sometimes you have to defend freedom and liberty\nThat that is the case and you barely acknowledged relaxed I think World War two is necessary\nSo you're entitled to a point of view I just want to clarify the differences there let's go to a jak in Aurora, Colorado you're on with mark\nSo thank you so much food as old as ... who's going to keep all new coal women thanks for taking my call\n...

Bush called for\nA some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up some of the mess that Ted Kennedy left back in the sixties we simply hadn't had any ah any immigration reform to speak out from that time and uh uh the Congress drag their feet in ... on on this thing\nUntil actually after Brock Obama had already been elected but it hadn't been inaugurated in two thousand and eight\nAt the last minute in December of uh the lame duck Congress passed and immigration reform act and I'm as it went through committee and in the weeks prior\nThey just kept piling more and more and more garbage into this thing and George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred twelve hundred pages I read the entire like\n... and I read all the documentation that goes with the Dianne Feinstein had slipped into their section too overweight somewhere\nMaybe uh three quarters of the way into the bill of the problem is it that we have now they've created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is is they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents\nBack up prior to the passage of this legislation a bear in mind I live in uh the the town where we train most of the border of told people okay\nThe federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great interest and all this stuff oh in in the past prior to that two thousand and they feel almost everybody who came to the border and maintained kind of claim of asylum or anything like that\nThe border patrol agent on the ground and his supervisor in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination\nWhether or not that person got the state it was never prior to two thousand and eight issue of deportation from the federal court ... court to become involved with\nSo George Bush signed this very or as a lame duck leaving and you may remember ... W E voice was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation [noise]\nWhat do you feel that it was better than than what they had prior to that that circle certainly accomplished many of his goals\nAre irreversible way up this country tomorrow ... so that being said uh the regulatory environment that came out of that uh all of that bill created all of this stuff that we've had since two thousand and eight\nSo for ten years we've been dealing with this I mean the only way it's probably going to get solved this for the courts to\nRecognize that not everything years for education that a ... at some point they're going to have to take the spirit of the law rather than their own individual feelings into a\nInto a factor in stark past the rules in regards to list we may be able to do that now that we have some remembered it sounds pretty court but I'm not even sure about that it may take another piece of legislation to solve this problem Marc", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Torrington", "day": "16"}
