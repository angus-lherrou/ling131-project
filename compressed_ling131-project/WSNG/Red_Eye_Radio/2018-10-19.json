you but Gary and heritage\nWe'll be back with you on Sunday night and Monday morning that's really Monday morning it's not like it's two separate days I could easily get used to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious demand you're kind of comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the market for show dogs\nSo gracious demand you're kind of comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the mark I showed dot com where you can also email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to on the show although I must admit I don't use Twitter\nLike I used to once I found out the bias and stuff I just uh it's just very discouraging\nAfter this next week after this week I'll be next on October twenty ninth on another natural showing you can check that out on my Web page we're on Facebook\nTo summarize what we've been doing the last few days there's been a progression of themes kind of on Monday morning it was a follow up to the judge Kavanaugh hearings and your reaction to my belief that we've entered a new civil war in this country between the left and right I used to say I'm not a violent civil war but I have to what's been happening\nThe last year or so I'm I'm not sure that's true and uh I I think it's going to get worse especially if we talked about this last night especially if the Republicans keep the house\nBecause the Democrats the lesser liberal does the media almost all the same thing they're convinced that going to win the house and at least take back ... one part of Congress and if they don't I Can't imagine what the reaction is going to be\nOn Tuesday Morning I talked about the great job that President Trump is doing and of course the unbelievable anger towards them by the resistance right they even that coined that phrase right away the resistance like yours is the Nazi Germany or something or fascism\nAnd of course that's what they believe and I also asked you who would be your favorite choice to get the Democratic nomination for president and who would you agree to have coffee with on the other side side by the way that was a sign\nThat many of us ... troubles choosing someone that's pretty bad at it wasn't always that case\nI chose personally I chose Bernie Sanders because I thought he seems to me like he might be a pleasant fellow\nActually I'm ahead of what's her name of ... see I always say the wrong by what's her name or ... something Cortez yeah Cortez she doesn't even choose ... who says that they asked her about whether they would support whether she would support the Bernie for the presidential nomination\n... takes a lot to see the election results and I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might wind but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that ... thing going on [noise] it didn't even cross or my for second that I could be on the other side\nAnother time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... a teacher trainer who's running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room tall you teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you do you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life I Would have been the end of me\nAnd a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia died and another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I played along\nAnd his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI'd probably didn't hide my look of dismay 'cause he shot me 'cause he immediately walked away having no idea that I adore just ... and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching the public school system\nIt's kinda like the McCarthy Era to reverse but I have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know what you do if you have to keep a quiet at your job what happens if you discuss politics with your family or friends were on the opposite side you better not do that a Thanksgiving that's the end of that dinner\nAnd if you're a Democrat or left left us I Want to hear from you too but I strongly suspect that you are not disowned by conservatives among your family or friends if you even have such people you're friendly with\nI just don't think we do that on our side because when you think your views are misguided and you think we are evil so I Want to hear from people of all

Kara\nHi how you doing well\nGood I'm enjoying the show last up all night you do have a black and white diverted that several times to anyway um the subject was about how people react to you and they find out your Republican and I have a son with autism and in the autism community it's very difficult to\nMake and maintain friends or my son and he had had a friend Cynthia about four years old he's Fifteen\nNow and I've been very good friends with his father who is a Democrat and just recently on Facebook he's asked me to not contact him anymore and the that friend him\nBecause I'm a Trump supporter and I just found that that devastating because the you know\nOver ten year friendship and he's willing to throw it away just because we think differently and I don't see where that is necessary\nYou totally support my thesis we don't do that you never would even think of that and he friends you know by the way I guess it could affect your son's relationship with his son or daughter whatever it is it's it's awful it's unbelievable\nYeah well that's all I had to say and thanks for taking my mind and and I know and that night\nThank you very much and now you're national forecast for cobra electronics\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas there'll be a little strange today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday for the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today\nSo you you've kind of given me an idea that we we can evolve this thing and would you mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and er what's his name I just lost the carnival\nYeah James Carville uh they're married and they were stream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this May of ... could you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\nKnow why not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and you you white wine is one little facet of our lives defy everything you know of course I could play like you're ...\nYou're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay because it doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about right or as an example\nI'll get in trouble with is I think a lotta times single women who voted Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things oh give me another one maybe this very I teach my students values or what should camp\nNot so much and I say it's my pin you don't have to agree with me not so you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time it's it's the person's values that you should care but here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nBecause you conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day you're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever and she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent ... share that\nAnd the church or whatever and she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent ... share the same values and the isn't this one of the values I'm not saying not to be friendly\nBut I that's why I ... I Want to ask everybody to could you marry someone and you are very consistently said sure why not it's one thing\nAnd when I'm pointing out maybe it's not just one little thing maybe it's something very important what do you think about that\nYeah well I mean we're all Americans here I mean yeah I guess that could be some ramifications down the road but I mean if you lie to me and my girlfriend get along and we\nHave a good report with each other and I love her she loves being I mean I I you know I I\nI Can't imagine that coming up to the extent I mean I'm fifty eight so I don't have to worry about children which is a valid concern but I mean I you don't want to go to\nYou know people my mom and dad my dad was a southern Southern Baptists my mom was a Roman Roman Catholic they got along fine for fifty five years you know I I guess you all love each other's noses in it you learn to live with the other person it's all marriages about compromise anyway so\nThat when you're good my producer is not as good as you he\nHe's he said to me you're going to be divorced than five years anyway if you marry someone on the opposite views he when he was just being cynical well you you have a good attitude\nAbout it and you weren't consistent when I challenge you said yeah what what's the big deal and you're it's very fascinating that you said on these social media sites that it's only one side that says something about being Trump's Porter is mark thanks for your call it is amazing the hatred and the hey you're out there is just\nThe you know for the president and or anything you know that's associated with him right so if you work in his administration you can't even have a meal that's incredible that never happened years ago or they'll protests by your house\nLike ... what's going on I was someone asked me that puts the oil you kind of set of mark what's what's happening in this country\nThat's why I said the first nice I I think we're entering a civil war and this is so strong this is so big for some people that are they don't want to accept it let's go to David in let's see if I can see that ...

I think\nIf you didn't make a call ... absolutely but David you made a big mistake I think he uses the word monkey wrench which got the candidate for governor in Florida in trouble right we're not supposed to just use that in all talk you must be a racist even bring that up\nOne of the things I was going to say to you that uh it's amazing that the other side doesn't imagine that people on our side where justice is upset when President Obama got into office as they are with President Trump\nI Know you have to stay in for President Obama but I Would never think of starting a resistance nor saying and doing things that people do about President Trump and I certainly didn't go around and letting ruined my life if I met someone and I do I play tennis with people who are Democrats some of them\nTwenty six just no denying celebrating Texas Chicken broth expecting a participant and hundreds of restaurants to him about such as ...

Virginia Joe you're on with mark\nMartin good morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic I I'm I'm actually calling into a tiny little story about my sister but I Want it to all of a you know on Facebook I've I've shutdown Facebook just because\nEven if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just for no reason you know it was almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really\nYou can you hear the story do don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the shops they got an ... billion socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on\nI don't know what she saw a but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time just hang in there [noise]\nUm I was just thinking of ah you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a\n... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did to put it in it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a lot of Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a\nHer father died and she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that eventually people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nAnd mark is great to talk to you I'm I've been to a you know Republican and conservative my whole life and I went into the military right after high school\nAnd um it most of the people um that I met in the military were bitter because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support a a raise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know just that okay well if they're for being as announcer them\nUm and then as time went on um when I'm a first are you\nA Gulf walk him about um I just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause\nAt the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time in the car and\nI'm just want it to listen and you know I've found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I was the pushing anything on them\nAnd um when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I think he's for somebody who's just you know terrible and I'm just like\nYou stand I've been mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and he's doing conservative saying things to make our country better and you know I still see people rallied against\nHim and I'm just like wait a minute we'll be greatest economy in that we in\nThis country's ever see you know we have I mean you see jobs for truck drivers you know that the five thousand dollar bonuses for someone to start that job\nYou know I mean for construction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and they and you know these tech job that paid huge amount of money so it's like you know if you get the right degree if you get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck fork in construction and\nEveryone seems to be still upset anything close\nTo stand back and look what's going on but\nYou know I I had a friend\nTell me right to my face I get so mad at you when I when I read the things you folks that I just want to shoot you in the head and she laid\nA hand signal legumes owning a gun at my head and I was just so hurt by that and\nYou know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and it just seems like a lot of my friends are just like ... you know we can't defend the demand that because she's like tunnel Trump and I just don't want to be around her anymore and it\nIt is hurtful and um\nThe demand that because she like Trump and I just don't want to be around here anymore and it it is hurtful and um yeah I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of all of that\nI'm a transgender woman though a lot of people on the right hated me for the trans up more hated me because I like Donald Trump and you know my family a lot of my family is like me because I'm transitioning it and also because I'm Republican and then I have a\n... ... people that look at me like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like a thousand you know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me telling me\nThat I'm wrong for being who I Am and I don't think that anything worse than my people telling you they can't accept you for who you are and and it\nIt's just horrible well\nI feel your pain that I use the bill Clinton line but\nI can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to be I Can't imagine what you're going through a it is it's tough enough or the challenges that regular life holds for all of us alone when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nOr to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and home of homes ah all this kind of stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that that may be I ...\nI have a volunteer work for a ... I was running for Congress in my area and Jerry ... and ... ... is an army\nVeteran and has been a combat is African American and tear economy the older white guy who's been there for ten years called him a racist I mean it's just like a I have a yeah\nBy the way I've got I got to think if you're a service and then well my advice to you you didn't ask me is just hang in there there are other like minded people but you know in this world if or when I ask\nPeople many good friends do you have and some people breathe say non and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think said\nThere is someone I don't like all have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and to be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have the different colors are said we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else so my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people\nOkay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the thing I just brought this up because I Know it's a real issue\nJust imagine ... aside in this country whereas some causes set including my young friend there are all Americans in the final analysis John Kennedy said that even about the Soviet Union that we all bleed the same there you know what is this stuff\nPretty sad to see this as America and today and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of seven thirty three thirty nine [noise]\nGeorge Foy toll free ...

let's go to Howard in New York City you're on with mark\nHi I just wanted to cover for items would prove about the Democrats\nThe first one is one Obama went ah people didn't listen to what you get get his number right away when he made a speech in Egypt in March of two thousand nine basically what he said in that speech was the U.S was to blame for a lot of things instead of saying the U.S made that ... some mistakes\nAnd uh we we we uh meant well but we didn't do it he was knocking to us at knocking it down like he was the enemy of the u._s. people and then he he uh\nHe uh didn't invite my beret the head of Egypt invited his enemy there so he can get 'em overthrown and then in Chuck Schumer in two thousand eleven locally said that we got to do something about the first amendment\nOr here in New York you know because uh that but in two thousand or living it didn't carry much weight because we weren't that liberal at that time uh we have to control it because people are saying bad things about\nUh candidates and then the the third thing was was ... when a when he went off\nAnd he went to a after the four people got killed the next day he Wendy was scheduled to go to raise money on the coast that he's still went and blame that on that disk you know the thing and the and the one that he really should have gotten impeached for\nDefinitely was when the when the insurance companies say one or two and a half billion dollars more for Obamacare now maybe they needed it maybe they didn't that someone at that point the Congress wouldn't give it to them\nAnd he took the two and a half billion out of the treasury which he has no authority to do it all and gave it to them and even if they did nothing about it\nAnd that's a minor stuff 'cause what he used to do with Obama is every hour on the second he would lie to you and people would that stupid because they're not detailed when I tried to explain something to someone because I'm a very detailed person they don't
