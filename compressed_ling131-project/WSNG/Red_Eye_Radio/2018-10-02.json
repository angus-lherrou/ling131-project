people largely believed what benefits they're affiliated party more than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh\nWhile roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not overall ... found that forty one percent belief for thirty five percent believe Kavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent believe for thirty one percent believed Kavanaugh Harris Poll\nGerman mark

three percent alone said Kavanaugh seem credible alone a total of twenty seven percent said that both seem believable\nOr the sixty seven percent total felt the board was credible fifty percent felt the cabinet was credible where the Harris Poll study gets really interesting is in its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and the issue of cooperation the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor right span rabbit\nOr the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should send to the high court when we're ... we're told that the ... name witnesses do not cooperate boards claims fifty seven percent said they are in favor of his confirmation\n[noise]\nIf the FBI found no cooperation purports claims

they go from here remember after twenty sixteen after Trump won in a again a a you know as a as a a former President Obama said there was always a twenty percent [laughter]\nAfter\nThe election and then like I Know it's a hundred per se I'm Out of the smartest president that we ever had\nTo stand the room right to understand that it's a hundred percent because he won a uh but you know they were remember all the self reflection that happened at that time [noise] [noise] Eric and I went into hysterical laughter Robin ... time in late November early December twenty six team\nWhen they started you know getting reflective and saying we need to we need to and just start it instead of just flying over flyover country yeah we want some work boots and some coverage on Amazon we we need to devise

for the times that\nDidn't even leave as his apartment to through the stories that you just said he went to [laughter] it was his name Brian Williams I don't think it was now\n[laughter] but but if you don't you don't even have to I mean that but it it is a very basic point that [noise] how can you be doing analysis\nReal analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that in an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is\nI'm not expecting them to have the same and turtles that a campaign without or that a party would have [noise] but I Would expect that\nThey would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties that would see some things and say okay it's there are real because\nObama is not always the twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said [noise] I don't I don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania because there was something else going on and it was anecdotal\nBut if if we could see that really was out and we did research they were not going to say there were no rules but we don't have the tools that are available that\nA news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or any of them have\nThey have ... rooms filled with people that can whack and do that we ... we\nDidn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right or in Michigan and Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information\nThat they had where they started seeing that the that the turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do now for those people that because we always get the people who call a pollster number right actually\nThey are ... you can find polls is we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time whether it was really twenty twelve and twenty six team will really started looking and saying okay well polls were actually correct and what you find out is\nUh yeah ... ... months out three months out\nFour months out the polls aren't that accurate once you start getting a thirty days in ... you start seeing that the polls start tightening and by the time you get to a couple of days beforehand or people for example say that the polls for drop are completely wrong\nNo they weren't you know there were polls that were dead on for the numbers [noise]\nThey may not have the polls didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cost them to do it right or let the the by the time you got to the to the polls are done on what the\nPeople are thinking uh and and so to get to those specific districts and and break them down you would probably need more votes you would need need more numbers than what you what your sample sizes\nYou know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to actually do to predict\nIt's your sample sizes you know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to actually do to predict but they did know\nThe internal polls they started knowing about two weeks before that there might be a shift happening uh in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and the Michigan and in Wisconsin but the fact is the polls on the where the people voted some of them were dead on yeah you're right I mean just within a half\nA percentage to a point of the actual numbers and they said don't show Hillary winning ... show with Hillary would get in the raw vote and that's what she did get very close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college ... so you know that's something that they've since we've had\nTo elect ... you know two very close votes ... ah you know back in two thousand and and uh in in twenty six team you know maybe they should start looking to see if they could pole and then figure out the electoral college you know that way if\nThere is a better right right it was a better way to do it but well you don't you start back in the day with Tim Russert he would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look if this happens here and these districts here\nAnd those districts and this this precinct here in this state and all these come together you could see the electoral votes in this state go to they he would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration as\nTo where it might go it wasn't based on sentiment wasn't based on responded that was based on basically history and indeed given precinct or or any given district in a state\nYou know they would break that down they don't try and do that anymore but if you if you watched election night\nOr twenty sixty\nWhat you saw was this I mean it was a very ... attitude was they were almost doing it was almost a parade for her\nHillary Clinton and then into the evening\nThe later it got after the polls closed it just went\nDown where it was a downward spiral because it was reality and they had painted the picture and the media helped of something that wasn't true and they saw it as landslide without looking at again\nYou know how this might add up right\nUh but looking at the polls now as we were we were you know the doing earlier\nA ... at our pre show meeting a I I see a ton of races out there I mean I'm looking at the Arizona race right now the Arizona Senate race ... versus send them a Christian sort of the Democratic a Democrat and a Martha McSally the Republican and\nYou know the the last repulsive set them up three seven six and three ah and but the but\nIn earlier polls are earlier in the month a mix Sally was up by a couple well right now the latest poll was one to the from the sixteen to the twenty rush still not into the myths of the whole\nCabinet thing and cinema was up by three by a margin of error four point seven that's a dead heat and if you if you look at that overall except for the uh the one likely voter poll by CNN\nThat was that was done where she was up by seven everything else shows that that really is a dead the that is a dead heat right there and we don't know what the polls are going into the cabinet vote I think a ... and again I think that the cabinet vote has the potential to energize both\nBut I Do believe that it may energize Republicans more be it he whether he is a not confirmed or ...\nFirmed the energy that I see right now the motivation to voter motivation on the right to me is much greater than it was two weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the left because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the last year looking at the last\nTwo years looking at this mid term right and so the energy is there I Do think just because I how important it is when you talk about the possibility of and again you don't we don't know one cabinet is going to do cabin on could get on and do what\nWhat what Roberts did you don't know but the possibility and I were talking about were\nRoberts change the uh you know the the wording mhm and Obamacare had to actually you know to fit the narrative that he wanted to ... people were shocked by it but on the other things when it comes to regulations\nIs a seems to be in construction and so all Supreme Court justices at times\nThe two people were shocked by it but on the things when it comes to regulations\nIs eight seems to be in construction and so all Supreme Court justices at times can be a mixed bag but you just you never know how this is going

think they specifically didn't put the effort in there but the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico had\nTo say this this might have been a little bit off the topic and moving more towards the cabinet thing I Believe\nI'm not a drinker I can honestly say I've never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my only good traits I don't [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be might be the world's worst\nSelf deprecating humor from Donald Trump yeah\nYou know the last time that I've given came close to that was and no one saw it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was at the the summit in Singapore ... after they did the the photo up with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference and he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might I might tell you that\nThis deal did not work out I didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and\nThe other point that that I think uh that the other thing that America Mr course was his his wind in his victory speech\nThat night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking and of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replaced by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at you know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet\nBeing settled in ... after the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these are the people who are being appointed if they accept that you know a third that nomination than\nThey know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that to put the cabinet and plays and the staff in place that he really wants and his second year\nI think the case could be made\nBy recent activity or lack of activity that may be the president has also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms could be either or but I\nI I Do believe that the president has always been in the private sector comfortable in his own shoes that changed when he\nWent from having zero bosses to having more than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place\nFor a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign\nAs he became president and I think there's a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and it has now does what he can do what he can do\nI think there's probably a little more thought based on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with media because here's the thing he's winning on the cabinet nominations they wanted an s\nOh you interact with media because here's the thing he's winning on the cabinet nominations they

that the new president should or should pick the nominee\nAnd I ... and that did not that was not there was not a given at that point\nThat Trump was going to win one on the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week\nWas the ... the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was the head of the Senate\nWhen it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that uh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice yeah\nThe people in power we

New York Joel welcome you're on ... radio show high it is just going to be a swine\n\nJust the way it is like a ... can you hear it yes\nOkay we're going to say you know but [laughter] it's if you look at most liberal in crazy people out there that are occurring and so now\n... you know the double standards it in a double standard they wouldn't have any at all and um you know here in New York state\nNo and the boss and this is a thing where their thing have you ever been arrested on the job application oh yeah yeah yeah that and hope that Dan yes but at the\nHunting you know they're going back to the war now her cat on other people like that and uh you know ... they want to have that for her little you know the criminal typically urban setting a at a polish but now they're going that his high school your books are generally it's awful\nI mean it's it's not it's not unexpected though not mean I'm I'm not I'm not surprised by it I'm surprised by\nThe lame that they will go to how ... it is and I thought they would probably have more sophistication in their attack\n[noise] uh I'm actually surprised at how they have uncovered\nYes that sort of an inside joke with us we ... we always tease him we always tease them on that show\nAre we are right now as a nation of a fiscally does anybody believe that that's a good situation to be in would anybody want to I wouldn't want to be a message nothing\nYou know\nEspecially with the bills that have to come do over the next ten years\nWhen you're talking about the millions and you're making thirty what something thousand a year yeah\nRight it's time to ration your ... but no we we don't want to do that we don't want to control our spent\nA I guess then that everything is settled in ... this just lost completely this this wasn't a part of the news whatsoever right but the president had to agree with all the spending bills with no additional funding for any I mean you\nWe added one point two trillion to the debt so that didn't happen you know that's oh wait a minute no no no no no if this is Obama's economy it also has to be Obama's debt right now [laughter] ... [laughter]\nWell I can say we're all we're all in this big part after you've got are now [laughter] [noise] well I mean what you think about it if if Republicans\nAre because remember the it's the it's the deficit this year that's going to skyrocket through the roof yes over a trillion dollars in one year and we're not at war\nNo it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not in a recession throwing seven hundred a ... billion dollars at at the banks or any of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats\nWere able to take over both uh the Senate and the house and\nWhat would there never will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats won\n\nThe Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunk and sailors but at least a drunken sailor is ... how did they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking offended they throw out ice on anybody got an relates doesn't it\nUh but how much would Democrats ... Republicans are ... are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care if there is no political pressure this will continue as\nI said this is this is my the twenty ninth anniversary this week of doing talk radio\nUh the first issue that we hit which was back in eighty nine was the uh whole clean sweep that Congress will spending too much money and it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget the protests all over the country of people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was\nFour trillion or less ...\n\nMaybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point ... but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [noise] [noise] yeah like some of them are marching ... what are you guys marching for the debt who's the\nNational debt oh\nBy the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh\nUh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar again last year from the federal get them every working American the the that's that basically as it is split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf\nBut remember in the tax bill last year mhm\nThe only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes\nBecause working norm is Lee wealthy exactly that's why we're as the one caller said a couple of years ago ... millionaire yes which was a surprise to all of us just keep it up\n\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the\nMy Fifteen year old vehicle that has two hundred and ten thousand model oh yeah yeah yeah no I put that out what the trash men that that would be gone my butler would I Would of because of certain business ... we both share of we can't take them anymore and therefore our our business did matter\n[laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset yeah we are actually looked at the tax by the tax thing was the right thing to do is we evolved in state of before a irrespective of the unfairness\nTowards us other problems 'til the spending a and and that's what it comes down to the weakening because the the the fiscal policy uh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and\nAnd while all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy become something very different because\nAnd this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides this provides this provides that\nWill start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on a this program this federal program and yours your child's school you\nKnow start taking things away that's when people start getting motivated as when they start paying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out\nAnd you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not well there is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending\nAnd a number of issues that conservatives are watching and had been watching forever and are important because they've always been important but this is an end Obamacare as one of those\nYou know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something and somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one ... in California well\nWe'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nThat's why even though you have when you had Jake Tapper of CNN and and even Chris Cuomo questioning a case yo Cortez reality and Gail I'm In Florida and and and Gillum about you know the ... of Medicare for all because they understand what we're spending right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt\nAudio pay you can't pay for all van and hey we're what we're paying\nFor today it's impossible so the only thing you can do is put massive debt on the uh on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up and how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing\nExponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a a until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens but as we've said is immoral\nAnd nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical to be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before\nWe found a loophole of taxation without representation we found the loophole your tax\nThe future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this and we have found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand let's put it on them and because I said that I\nExpect to get the emails today which I always get whenever I said that oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in control in debt is all part of a\nBad lab ... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails well because it ... us actively when it gets to the point that you can't even service the interest\nOn the debt as a nation\nThe massive hit to the economy when our global trade partners can no longer trust the U.S [noise] it will be catastrophic in nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over\nNo no you can't because no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer and would that\nHappens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren will not experience or what the expansion of wealth and the freedom and liberty it brings\nTo their families they won't experience that 'cause they only play there is going to have the gum from the federal government taking over more industry nationalizing industry\nEight six six Ninety ... village with what I told free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million
