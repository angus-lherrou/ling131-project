Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons like you said a including perhaps a ... a political agenda\nWith respect to some businesses but the thing about this about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why NAFTA was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror married it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do\nIs make a law that everything must be produced here because then prices would skyrocket through the\nRoof you would have monopolies that would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be due to and retail doors shutting raft and right I don't know who the opposite for ... you would go in a massive\nRecession if we had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services which guy rocket drew the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology\nFor the most part we probably could produce down there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get from from other countries but say we even had those rare metals\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where\nYou know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we ... really one of the most underreported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago\nOil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you\nKnow if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did by the way I think that's the number one reason icon is supporting a or the or the the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's\nNot the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but the bug you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what\nThe ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great but what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials\nIs still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly controlled by the government that is something that is policy put in place that doesn't need to be there\nNow and you don't win and we stayed at the state of China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCamera and already agreed to that\nYeah I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA\nAnd then there's not much change from the old NAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed that he claimed was the fact\nThat the tariffs worked to get what he wanted with the automobile industry right\nAll all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah nobody is debating that that's not what happened\nAnd that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals or his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA\nDoes is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent ... uh and uh the rest\nIs still the same right so you ask\nOkay what were the what were the because at the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles\nFor people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile\nFor all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods to you know it produces them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite\nOf the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean ... if you\nIf you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the um you and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the because\nAbout the political pawns president doesn't need\n\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite right because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about retaliation from\nOur trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers it's ... I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate so I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nIn terms of of getting things done as you said it was likely it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday\nThat show and and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nBut wait\nHe was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to the grocery Asian done he's a master negotiators he doesn't need to do that\nOr as I said it was said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right [noise] well and that's it except for the you know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America\nActually ... but the president did a lot of what what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business\nWith the tariffs that the president has put on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more\nOf the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion was the automobile thing I got what I wanted in automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of\nIn Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that you won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker right ah and\nEven with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said most in I forgot who else said\nWell it's only a two point five percent terror so really isn't going to affect that isn't that great so we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cause in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up as to his cap\nOn what what Mexico you know could send us in cars [noise] before other terrorists hit [noise] ... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap\nAnd car by and in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only\nDo we now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states\nAnd the United states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... weren't even running that Kevin weren't even reaching the cap well they're not read the caps that had been set in NAFTA\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving with outer preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's run I radio show dot com the red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors\nIncluding retro stopping centers how's lubricate or\nThe ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher Bond cats Gail and ... products\nIndividual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our eye with WBRC\nAm WBRC F.

you\nAre a rapist enabler that's what they were trying to sell the American people will see in a few weeks whether\nA part of America bought into what they were selling the polls so far show that they

why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\nAnd something that was already set\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that as my granddaughter ... kids was a it was a critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are\nIs that next generation and we've seen we've seen their studies that show\nWell the the generation basically behind the the the college age or college graduates now is showing more critical thinking and\nAnd not that they would be conservative ... ... what if they are assessing things for what they are instead of the fantasy that the left promotes are they the future of below we talked about during lumber who is the uh the uh uh a climate a professor that\nBelieves that yeah probably a a you know the greenhouse gases are causing global warming but leaves it everything the left is doing is actually doing the opposite\nSide of the opposite

S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon\nThey do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer ... plain and simple\nOr this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ... for those of you that are brand new listeners will do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update\nYou so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\n... who paid an opposition research from a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got or information\nHe says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order to change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign\nWhile the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of the well the cofounder of the opposition research from\nGlen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress according to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because\nThe congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n[noise] [noise] [noise] really know the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine or after\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nThat is Clyde would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nSimpsons firmed a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign ...\nFusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the CIA\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find a here's\nOur ... are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think I saw the right are are they going to ask him about a ...\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why brought\nThat up uh I don't think so what are they going to ask him a lot of money I was I gonna ask them about Kanye West probably not they're probably going to ask him about\nFusion GPS and their role\nOr in\nThe uh entire flow chart of the Democrats\nAnd the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\n[noise] so here's my question is thinking a of a a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife ... I was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the ... and an associate deputy attorney general\n... ah\nThe inspector general I Would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the ask\nA does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes the vice from the department and I and then again\nIf those are the ... that's the number of it right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that but [noise] so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think\nPart of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do\nAs you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved\nIn any way we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fit mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand from what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't [noise] let let's take him at his word ... that the house Judiciary Committee and the house oversight committee\nAren't trying to get to the true right\nThen I Would ask his lawyer than what do you think they're going after right if they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mother investigation the Mueller investigation has had nothing to do\nWith actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so\nThat would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you that there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nA fusion GPS committing any crime [noise]\nI don't know I'm One I don't know where there is any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that\nAnd it's odd that you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level\nIs is that's what you do you get dirt on the other party's candidate or whatever you do up as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\n[noise] what would\nThey be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about [noise]\n\n[noise] well and then finding the time it was interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I'll justify I'll go under oh I'll ... there are plenty of people that don't wander oh ... so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge that lens Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately\nWould be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson [noise]\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis farm ... [noise]\nThose are the questions that they are those are questions on the investigator would have running through their mind", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Torrington", "day": "14"}
