Al Gore\nTraveling the United nations as well there we have twelve more years yes ... twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first of all fears aren't we yeah yeah you never know what this twelve years they mean\nSo so how do we solve it well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax on carbon dioxide emissions would be made to be as high as\nTwenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the end of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline in that year\nWe're warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline in that year and a now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as\nFifteen five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon [noise]\nGas tax\nBy twenty thirty well then the experts we'll be right cars won't be on the Republican Party thirty in the bay won't be anywhere\nI won't be able to get it on my desk with his little centrally be a paper wait a ... you know and so all of a sudden we're back\nThe poor especially and the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately and greatest then they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they quote home and Jenkins for the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast\nSaid Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increased wetlands to handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies that encourage building in vulnerable areas and\nMentioning that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence Mr home and said\nMajor storms have become events\nThey afford great footage which feeds a false sensation viewers it's drones have become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day\nFor which the federal government does not shower them with they because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon reduction is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally a A R possible he said they could begin with Congress qualifying for the American people\nHow much they are forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael mhm uh again the blaming of President Trump oh sure and that's why like I said during lumbering if you want to check out his stuff\nUh he writes some great articles and he does believe again he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong but do we have an interest act interesting prospect\nYeah do we have an impact of course we have an impact but we're part of his life cycle here on this planet yes\nI Do as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write again I don't think anybody really knows you can take a guess but the average Joe on the average Joe I'm not a a you know atmospheric science scientist but ah from what I've read they don't know because the predictions are always wrong\nMhm there are things that we could measure in the past\n... that aren't necessarily part of the global warming thing but you do talk to them in terms of pollution\nParticularly ... matter yeah I could you want yeah you can quantify these are things that we can measure and we can understand the problem is is when you see policy especially the cost of government which keeps creeping up a that is put on the American people uh with out that\nKind of of evidence some discussion I mean again pollution you can measure\nYou can have the discussion there in fact I think the discussion is pretty much over um [noise] but it's different when it comes to well things you can see and the politically driven idea of greater taxation based on something\nThat hasn't had the pure

morning guys how are you All right well one of the reasons they start incorporating ethanol\nOr allow all into the fuel was that they used to use what was called the MTV metal tribunal ethylene as an

alcohol it ... it absorbs moisture from the air so long as you're going to get it like maybe one Ninety five Ninety like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland\nOne Ninety five Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland however alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right around them as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so which screwing the consumers ... doing yeah\nWell look we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when which part about

our problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything\nWould be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry down all that kind of monopoly the Greek government dictates All right you need to do this for the what's the reason well for global warming well what's the reason now to make sure you have a job ... or video robot here's your forecast\nHurricane Michael was a category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now forecast to be a dangerous major hurricane\nWhen it smacks the U.S Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center the forecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from between one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes life threatening storm surge is almost imminent\nA release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review now we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded golden couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days\nAs you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general an off the subject was ... ... ... that's the role of the inspector general is to do what\nIs to investigate corruption there and you it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release\nAnd what I can uh you know what I can under a deck you use that for that you use your a director of national intelligence year CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director\nThose are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know the the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to ... to ... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are the allies no they don't know what's in their ... how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa I look\nAt this but yeah the conclusion we came to was that\nIf you're looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the apartment of justice than you're basically asking him to do an investigation\nAnd to issue a report they said the experts they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz and the only reason you do that is because of the role of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office\nIn in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud uh around during the election and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a John Bolton in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff Kelly is well looking at that and saying if you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this\nInformation by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here if we jumped to the conclusion well first of all the executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there\nYou would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before committed a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items\nThat would be on the plate of the inspector general's office ... you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that\nYou're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think\nBeyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do here I think about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that\nCould be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while you already are supposed to be\nA ton of us and you know ... and\nHorror which is someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly on top of that you add\nThe fact of what the inspector general was designed to do and the kind of report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report a on the FBI there were a number of things and the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found\nNow you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under\nThe direction of a then director James Comey and what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation or was handled into and then part of late into the Russian investigation and all of that\nNow when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to you already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in\nPotentially in this classified or now de classified information so now ... having already done the investigation\nOr on the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation now has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lends support\nTo this new investigation um and it's ... I think interesting and I think very key that\nThe president turned it over the Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happened that you had somebody in the FBI\nVerify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what people who claim they're familiar with the matter\nA bully even and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that he believes there is possible perjury in the fact that ah the Pfizer warrant and they supporting documents with the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research\nAnd when the when everything was a redacted\nExcuse me on redacted when everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it ... how they got the Pfizer warned application the surrounding documents the three oh two\nAnd a communications between the higher ups of the FBI\nThat somebody in the administration said\nDon't release this Mr President because if you release this it'll be viewed as political you solve it Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially releasing what they want to release on that note if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed 'cause you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ...\n... either some being extremely wrong\nOr crimes have been committed and you give it to the inspector general because at that point\nHe can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence that you have\nBut he can go look for anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the the the ... the oversight committees could not get from the FBI there is no\n... process that stops Horowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nNow I Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI have tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security\nMake allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable to accusations that he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information another major episodes in American history\nFrom the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider\nSimilar to those offered to stop the release of information and other major episodes in American history\nFrom the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider or any it does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year in Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the put no really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report could be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking\nImpossible linked to the Trump campaign not a reporter a policymaker would have added an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday\nI broke this story John Solomon the Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat in an unclassified setting that he had met with the top lawyer at the ... representing the DNC\nAnd received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unverified salacious dossier\nBy the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became a central piece of evidence used to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying\nHere's another example again at the FBI and the department of justice ... these these things aren't top secret it sounded on national defense you know it's about covering their posture barriers otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it in a non classified setting\nI was the point\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on the end we will keep we keep you updated on it because we believe it's the most important unreported story really in the mainstream media today and that's it and thanks to Sarah a quarter and Solomon and\nEasier on the years in mind reached the stories to you will listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of vote your drivers is now available for free as an F.

Democrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue and you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming and we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that\nAnd raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always used them even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care\nIf we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well uh you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups or or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and\nGlobal warming well you haven't major case\nTo the vast majority of America let me go get a burger I is I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we we actually stay to during the Obama\nAdministration I'll never forget where we said are they doing this on purpose\nTo they actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy because remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time with the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better no it wasn't even in just a story that was being\nDiscussed and and they just went back to global warming and\nAnd race so I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you want what's the Democrats issue\nWhat are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer of former governor of of\nLouisiana ... two thousand two thousand sixty\nDemocrats or try some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional [laughter] it was just right [laughter] yeah uh it's not certain the Democrats just want to read the parts of it because I actually started laughing during it\nOr it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total cynic here at this moment but I think justifiable I can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice cabin up in a swap with Clinton era of positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on his public duties this is\nSeemingly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on those his public duties this is more a than\nA interesting irony and peach been would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base and make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton Democrats had\nAn alternative they can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to an act the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead\nSearch for common ground with marginal Trump supporters Democrats\nWon't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they won't win over ... Christians or other committed supporters buddy humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve\nOf his base Democrats can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate the richest religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nDefend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on mid term abortions fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyles expand access to health care without eliminating private insurance\nProtect minority rights without condemning law enforcement promote the immigration while protecting the borders value of multiculturalism without removing all mention of God or the tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans from hunting and defending themselves\n[noise] have you lost me now have you lost and may already on the ... yeah okay with that are not going to happen [noise] [noise]\nYeah I lost you win a while right after we started laughing [laughter]\n[laughter] they'll do respect to the governor no um you know a number one's not gonna happen no is it is not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and then it will never happen\n[noise] um no I'm\nWell it it can happen and you look [noise] we as we said this after twenty six team we said this one Democrat\nBecause I find this fascinating I I find the ... election that the Democrats go through ... you know of\nAnd they've gone through it and if you were election cycles where they say okay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we have to get outside of the Washington and there are ... we we need to we need to go into the heartland and see how people are really thinking yeah and they really said that's in twenty six team we have\nTo seriously reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction complete opposite yeah they'd gone more insane now they've gone more authoritarian\nThey've gone more dare I say using the F. word a with a fascist mindset out there while blaming the that they are the anti fascist that's the most interesting point\nYeah um and and it's that's not going that's not going to change a where it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of mind it out what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the ... the foreign left liberals are\nThose that are really I mean then they're leading the party now I mean I think after the uh\nCapital confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now [noise]\nUm but nonetheless what would bring them back [noise] what would bring them back and bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most insane part of\nUm I mean we can we can giggle it at a governor Jindal's you know\nA appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford a\nScript and his message because I Would ask both of them before we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nA as especially when they are they stunk and they can't get out of it and just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims because which ones are not the cause of it like this is this is what that's a great while yet read for once you leave the Trump is the cause of Trump's not the cause of it he has the effect\nOf it and and so tell me if you think that would change just to say for the sake of the argument I Know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately and my pants became president\nWould have a beautiful whom by our world that's right\nThat is a moral to resign effective immediately and my aunts became president\nWe would have a beautiful whom by our world that's where I'd everywhere would go back where being normal we could invite Michael Moore onto the show when we would have a love fest right\nUm well case it yeah right right oh he's sitting in your lap not mine I'm\n...\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what are the only full but God was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know what I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs\nSo and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's a here's the adult I really really do well our churches are ... well enough that simply said they don't have data they can handle the stress or not enjoy that\nThose which bed go with that yet again that's actually what I'm\nActually ... there was an engineering so [laughter] that's what it was\nSo here's the question if chase it became president tomorrow do think it would change you know it would not\nIf John McCain were still alive and ran for president and won what a change you know what they called John McCain\nWould change yes he'd go back to being Hitler yes eight six six Ninety read I", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year":
