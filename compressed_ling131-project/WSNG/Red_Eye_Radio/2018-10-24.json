Ninety run ideas are counting on ... thank you for being here this morning we um we appreciate it as we're less than two weeks out from the the the mid term election I think this is going to be a\nA mother fascinating time in in our history to see where this goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we look at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent his time especially after presidential elections looking at the polls would actually got it right\nAnd you know we we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right at on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was him and and so you know that there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is wrong statement to make a\nLot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use a you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right before an election\nWe have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are that are affecting at a you know another thing\nIs and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may if if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it a a Trump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just point that we're just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back to ...

Radio Welcome to the show Hi\n[noise] hello I called you a long time ago you guys are awesome bank wanted to point out something that you and your listeners probably do not think about or see ah\nThe rhetoric side of it with ... and all the other things like that the younger people that are all round Eighteen a lot of them love that\nI talked to a [noise] like that or whether and bitter bad\nYeah yeah we we lost we lost\nAbout half of that and we've got a bad reception there I don't know about that I you know that the bats anecdotal evidence\nAnd we're talking about influencing votes really we're talking about likely voters or the Eighteen year olds aren't in the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not so there may be something they're on social media\nUh that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at at certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're undecided during the center got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know kept that vote\nAnd that's what you're trying to do it you know you don't want it you don't want to jump into something where again it's [noise]\nIt's unnecessary it's it's not a positive I've always\nUh yeah I've I've always been about getting every when you possibly can and once you have the when a accentuate the positive about when which would have been the go after Abbott Eddie\nRight yes because ... I mean we've seen it he's a liar um he's a he's ... and and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that\nOr he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody names\nYou call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nThat is you ... you're going to bring you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's a ... well no that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nAnd then the things you want to get done but then\nYou get you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the caravan thing you get all all these\nDo you want to get done but then you get you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the care of and things you get all these other things that you know and and of course ah you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know come out with Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or work or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out we're there's aren't going to work and that's something that is extremely rare in politics even with ah other affect the presidents of the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy you know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this current economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally\nA rally is a a ton of positives and this map this massive group\nOf foreign people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media shouldn't be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positive as you can go after Chuck Schumer right it buddy ... because I\nI think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising when that's ridiculous I of course you have to point out one out sometimes you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all that you Ron right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs\nAll solve crime and you know not really like right well I'm telling you\nThat that that it then that's why I started to have the uh started laughing because ... you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe at times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabinet hair instead it's unacceptable to us and we've been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for cabinet or\nYou know they were both Democrats were trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political cord that\nHad much of the same enforcement mechanisms but a criminal court has when you testify right\nAnd and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of caring about\nAmericans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate way she can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out that\nPeople say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody that ought to pay for it because they believe they are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject the second amendment if you\nReject a due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people's about so shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not there are the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America we're just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nThey're trying to say is a well it's like when they say\nThat's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say you know we believe in free speech well no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know that this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them and you can probably say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm\nBecause they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have the when the move onto the next when well again I think\nWe got to win for calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy\nAnd look what they want to do with it and went back to and and the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective I [laughter]\nLiar Lanny I now I made that one up I don't know I'm not I'm not a [laughter] they can use the ones I I don't want to get ... was uh what was it\nI don't know when when ... when you start and they said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah I'd I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere all day like names ... no ... we've said this though well now it's brutal people in office it's pay the money it's beautiful ... that is not lying to them [laughter]\n\nAnd and as far as we know the president no longer believes that\nMr Cruz's father had involved in the U.S [laughter] as far as we know [laughter] but but look I'm we said before\nI got one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd and the name of of of policy on one side and now we were on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant any I mean that's something that works brilliant is a big word but is that something that's it it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nIt because it's real simple if it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not promote\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like because he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making you know it's not about one man for really [laughter]\nRecess appointments really [laughter] it's not about one man Mr I

you know with about\nThe egg they the excitable turn out that you know ... you know that that's what they talk about the excited voter out there on both sides by who's the motivated excited voter who wants to go out and vote\nNot just me and it's a positive excite but it can be an an angry excitement and if so if you look at the big picture out there or the Democrats that hate Trump\nNow could they hate him any more\nThan they did the\nUh the day before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is the is the anger is still there to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know we you and I talked about\nThis this president is up I every president just unique and every Republican president we forget because people will say nobody has ever been attacked by Donald Trump before\nWe forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is the difference between a Bush and Donald Trump is which never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad as her ... ... ... remember the protest\nI mean back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad as her from ... ... remember the protests started his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas ... it was everything they were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was Hitler he was\nA and and as Bill Maher said\nYeah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we called them Hitler but they really weren't but Trump is some and they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is whether\nThat's a wonderful wonderful Republican actually named Hitler runs one day but like I did I\n[laughter] I\nI'm trying to think if there is is there a politician in American aimed at where I'm I'm guessing if that's your name and you you might want to change it and most have\nBut there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've rented a well ... ... and and the thing is as I mentioned earlier\nThe danger of Trump exhaustion was blown out of the water because of capital right\nRight and is it is as it is it's not ... fire right on that I like how energize yeah is there are the Republicans yeah because I never\nIn in that time period that that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent and we'll find out in two weeks but I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so I'm you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time\nKnow was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh\nThat to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it could be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right right yeah\nUm and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know ... ... if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west or just to turn some of those districts or or to just keep people at home\nI don't even know that it will you know change your vote from right to laugh at the people but if you stay home

is currently and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety right I just reading here from CBS\nNews out now this this is they want to hear fake news yeah this this this this is what's wrong with the media today go ahead [laughter] they got the headline right but the first paragraph huh one winning ticket was apparently sold for the world record one point six million\nMega millions jak a and a and a nod million no ... and they had it right in the headlines\nThe headline was right mega millions on record one point six billion dollar jackpot ... winning tickets in South Carolina Lindsey Graham has resigned apparently the Saturday after winning out just [laughter] that would be so funny if it were if it were him yeah uh well congratulations what does that person going to a group of people going through right\nNow if they know talk about freak out mode\nThere's someone wrote the story again you know because they they did this series on a on cable I Know a rubble stories of people one of the lottery and just ended horribly\nI'm an someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell you and your family\nBecause that was a that were in those specials a you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell you and your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt that when you claim the prize the word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nAnd they just connect their phone the next day and left\nAnd you know because it it I'm sure it became crazy with\nRelatives you didn't know you had in the whole thing um\nAnd and that's the real you know that's the real risk of it because that's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing and they were trying to win the money\nAnd their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative a wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know and sometimes it's not not even people view you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop knocking at your door\nYou know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that way if you fulfilled every request\nThere would've been much more exciting than when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days would be like what a hassle [laughter] well I can only take so I thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall prize a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars\nThat's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already\nYou went to bed poorer\nThan than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nGo story always goes name was one of the least rich guys and the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a Mitt Romney and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and park it anywhere\nYou know what I mean I mean where are you going to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm ... and the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would uh I and there was a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm\nI'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would\nBe a huge hassle ... uh I like my life ... I don't want to change mhm I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I\nA a a friend who uh a friend or family member who ah bad boy at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day ...\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy I found a multi billionaire although well at least one listener thinks we are [noise] um but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money\nUm but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though to know I couldn't trust anyone\nYes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though to know I couldn't trust anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would\nI'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ...\nYou know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars\nSomeone's going to notice eventually yeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to\nCome up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my own laws there are laws about raising the money away their laws about giving money to\nYour it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if not going to give it away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone my life is life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like when like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know I Would want to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about there to fight that this is one dumped ... among but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think a life it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other time allow we've we've ever done you really I mean it's not I never think that outside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up until today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know yes where you're I mean we really have it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse outweigh the everyone's ... of the show we grab our lunch pals and go to ... that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift outside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for it\nSo I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion all\nThat goes away mhm and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing that now is it in my way because I have on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death\n[laughter] right then I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of sudden I'm going to get all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking\nOn his name but he ... he developed the game and he sold it ah I I I don't know of all have to look it up but anyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nIt was a girl who you know work you know for a living at a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was look I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm I'm at I'm just saying it's a weird I'm pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motives here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for you got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has ... security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the time is one of", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "24"}
