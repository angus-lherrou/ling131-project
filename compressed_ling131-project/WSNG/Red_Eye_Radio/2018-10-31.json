to Texas said we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today\nAs the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nOverruled by the court notified by the court also you know sort of half white lie you know log on life\nIf you if you had Congress come out today and and pass a law steady and look\nYou know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just an you know an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment covered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court to decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text\nAnd we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law to include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that and I I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that\nFor a and and then at that point the the courts would say well Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter] you know delusional scenario 'cause it's not going to happen\nBut I'm saying they could do that\nBut because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that\nMany believe that the courts will use that\nIn order to differ and say now sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion Nineteen Eighteen Ninety eight even though it wasn't a precedent that was said it was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch\nYeah they could do lower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it but it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation\nNeed to have when you have a a law that clearly is that how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly not being viewed by modern society as\nThe makers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back\nA hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah now a federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was said precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right\nYeah yeah yeah thank you Scott we appreciate it um I I because yeah that\n[noise] ... the ...\nThe argument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point\nReally not a legal argument he'll here that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenged and gets\nStill here that if if they were to take this case of the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenged and gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion\nOr in the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact but the impact remember is on [noise]\nWould be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even the we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point to a parents who were here illegally\nThat's not going to apply ... that's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children\nBorn in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that is that is not immediately affected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban well you and I had to go back and\nScreamed the word temporary how many different times\nBecause the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world\nAnd and it was you know again it was played out and it ended in a different in a different way the media but it's not going to it's not going to be it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of ... what the impact would be because the impact would be a future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never said it with Congress has never that there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted\nThe only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent that was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have judges even construction is judges even cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say well\nThere really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over a fight going on constantly for that\nAnd constant president being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about a specific type\nOf behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at it and said this is pretty clear that the interpretation whether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken and accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author ... that was not what the author of the amendment thought\nIt's been accepted all the way back\nNot just recently that it should be changed the back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their opinion of the Supreme Court and a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a consensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what\nThey would [noise] that's what I see where I think it's going to go\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh any republic any constitutional republic where a lot can be passed it'll be vegan somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged well\nAnd and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't\nMatter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges or if it's a new challenge it's never a new challenge me he said no one has ever stepped up to ... ... by agree with you on that is why it took two hundred and Thirty years to get\nYou know that guns are and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country after every Eighteen Ninety eight case would be\nDifferent because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of running\nRight what about the parents who aren't here ...\nThe opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that ... made the claim that they're running that every court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever ... challenge at and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you could be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it's stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically\n... that's the problem right well it hasn't\nBeen challenged ah so that's the\nA hundred years and then came back again magically ... that's the problem\nRight [noise] well it hasn't been challenged uh so that's the question is do we ignore it because it hasn't been child because nobody challenged it or not one sought to define that clause as well [noise] [noise]\nI I agree with you I Will leave without question you have\nSomebody on a ... a lot a ... ... when when you see that when if I was a judge and I'd say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution and say well I'm gonna flip a coin and and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back\nAnd you look at the first to men or the second amendment as many of the just as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you know it's\nIt's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that because it isn't a\nIt isn't a law that has written specifically there is no specific\n[noise] ... it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship [noise]\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] than ... ... they still went back and look to do it it's done ... clearly in their ... it really does because\nThe argument would be made then and this case coming from the other side well if if ah [laughter] if you uh Jacob powered the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be as such then citizenship clause should have been Britain's\nExactly and since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was well actually wrote

I don't believe it ever will but but I still do when people say well he's just does she just campaigning\n... an\nHour and ... why not doing this is part of the campaign promise ... from ... that's my my that was where I'll be I don't want exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nThat I could see if you're upset say he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill trying to paint herself as a Republican fried judge who happens to be running as a Democrat\nYeah now that's something you should complain about because she got telling you the truth right when you when you have\nNow when you got many Democrats trying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats want to know we're we're very very moderate they've gone back\nTo that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president [noise] this is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he's he got elected was illegal immigration and immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to\nUh just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is if\nHe's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did All right I don't think so and therefore when this is happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMinded help his campaign ... ... yeah but it's what he's always run on and it'd be consistent in his opinion ... why would anybody your buddy be upset about it or call it strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans ... right\nExactly that's a campaign that you should be upset about [noise]\nBecause that would be an action and I did the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged in the ... he knows that so he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yes politically\nAdded to that I told you about an old old friend of mine who I saw here in the last month and when I had last asked the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs do you have no she said seven cats and for dogs ...\nWhen I saw her recently I said hey how many catch you have them and she said well I have four dogs is at all but\nI said what nine cats ten thirty three ... thirty three cat yes her and her spouse actually put a extra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to non heated room but that's where the cats\nCan stay in congregate together well but uh thirty three that three cases of cat food a day\nI\nI don't know it's it's ... name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those are one hundred and sixty three million pets heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume too the ways that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats and consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ... here the energy\nAnd animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal\nProducts fed to them including ... feet goal production of\nThe problem isn't just the United states now or the or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest\nPet owners or be owned more pets probably both but tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue in pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally\nPet ownership all compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices if continues there's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help and emotional benefits would considerably reduce those impact the study concludes\n... one of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that jazz festivals yes so so what do we do with the dogs\nAre we supposed to put the dog down or\nOr just after this dog not get another\n... I never search for a cat\nI rescue rescued you let's be clear\nBy the fact is you're not the only person that sets that to me this week yeah I think that we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a\nAs a black cat just relies Halloween ... Halloween you know the funny thing is I had I had a bad few weeks ago and I\nHad all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector actually the smoke detector ... I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it beeps after about ... of an eight year oh yeah the toll is part of my house of course so\nDetector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it beeps after about ... oh yeah the tall is part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out really tested capabilities right\nSo I get up there and realize okay this is in my I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days\nSo do I take down a ladder not leave the ladder they've been able to buy tickets out yeah the letters there for a couple of days and I keep noticing the cat black cat keeps walking under the ladder thought that is good luck on that side and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's good luck thoughts I never had before\nUh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets but offer similar help and emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets\nPets go vegetarian [noise] you know something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous [noise]\n[noise] yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nYou know you know\nSo uh are there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from\nTaking the maximum number of pets possible yeah\nIt is yeah this is it's actually a point but to encourage Americans to consume less meat [laughter] so that's the point are and I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian I'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to have both of them today\nOr I might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember this goes back ten years ago\nI think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he has no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people ... and ... ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go yeah we don't want to go to I think was more than half\nWe're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with them I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes and and I think it\nWas out of the of the probably closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one\nRight so what do you give it to me [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay what's what's your plan I there are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first is that\nRight [noise] [noise] [noise] hey that'd be a cool psi phi movie right it's the end of the planet we're down to what ten years\nOr just some kind of doomsday whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base because that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say\nYou know the big chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then it freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter] let's not make it about climate change this time I Do not want to\nWrite but if we could whittle it down to one billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this a series over the period of years you know because you got ten years of Fifteen\nYears to figure it out to go to Victor up to deplete the population\n[laughter] I don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek didn't remember how the the\nTwo forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand um they like managed war and then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall and the ... member that one yeah\nI don't they were they open the window and there were like all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that problem yeah\nI don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six\nUh I haven't seen\nYou're seeing post apocalyptic type movies was children of men pliable and two thousand six\nUh I haven't seen it was about essentially a the there was women could not give birth there was whatever happened and the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her\nBecause all governments would want you know to\nA study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically\nAs lessening not in the crazy way that the Democrats are talking this far out far left liberals are talking about and just in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a ... of okay there was only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean the ... it's not that it would be one of those those questions almost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh Well Bruce Willis you know yeah it's got it's got to take one for the ... not no no that oh yeah no I was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Torrington", "day": "31"}
