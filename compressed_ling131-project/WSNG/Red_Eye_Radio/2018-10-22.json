a fairly comfortable lead and is over fifty in the most recent polls\n[noise] this is a bubble [noise] ... that's what the Democrats will try or just a bunch of others out there oh Trump Globes America we love America are\nWondering I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be but you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have\nYou and I've talked about it when you talk about the fact\nNow they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's see is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go ... or what they don't understand it those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of\nThe minority best way to protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claimed that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I've always got response old it's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on the actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting\nOr ... or we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution [noise]\nOh yeah and we can make that point and you and I've said for the longest time but it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before\nThey don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong and we've talked about that you know the support of the judges\nOn the judge has become activists judges and how that is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that\n[noise] and so the average person I think sees that and Trump is anything they look at ... and I look at Trump and you look at Trump as anything but an authoritarian and a fascist\nEven at times though his words ... ... ... ... don't say that yeah I when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's all a constitutional yes it's all\nPart of the process that was put in place [noise] hundreds of years

think I I don't think we should discount how important that is in this election debt reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing a especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards\nThat he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned B\nTwo years afterwards that he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Tibet O'Rourke a small little theater he couldn't filled that\nHere in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out is was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there was an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nIt and that's what it is but that's when it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to how the left as having an end type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the Kavanaugh confirmation process or you know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side\nAnd we'll see and a couple of weeks for video road log here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to

... you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't on\nYou know but it all away with it but then again you can't make the case that he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no one was on President what happened\nRight mhm and you you didn't look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five or ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was\nHe was confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe it was a Democrat Senate at the time\nYeah\nAh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we have ever seen a ... in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows that ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity of means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up so that didn't happen with sort of lawyer and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn

written by a majority opinion written by Scalia is exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm\nMhm ... what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we should look ... you know conservatism Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republican keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not [noise] I'm not voting for a conservative judge\nI'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right there their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting to see that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the ultimate vote on on a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based\nThat even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment\nYou can look at it from ... was recess appointments which was ... ... against all by against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process yes and so\nRespecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or\nWhether they're descending or majority opinions you can we can turtles apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nBut in terms of the process I think a by and large I have seen them\nDisplay consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but there are others [noise] a recess appointments was that unanimous decision where you can't do that and\nAnd and that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left\nBecause what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the president said do away with the

maybe\nTwo years ago you could have two years in six months ago that this would ever happen where President Trump is coming to Texas [laughter] the campaign and rally were were Ted Cruz for for for Ted Cruz yeah\nRight ... and\nThe vote your conscience Ted Cruz [laughter]\nThat'll our point of the other twenty Sylvie ... we're remembering their member and and this this is why again a lot of times what happens in her party between a a you know a couple of candidates means nothing right right right and\nWhen you think about it broke her member the remember what Trump was you know Trump was promoting the conspiracy theory remember that that Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination [noise]\nThis is a whole vote your conscience well that's [laughter] that's\nWhy we said anything anything since then they're probably because it was a minor it's like well don't you did you hear what he said well now did you hear what he said that two years in six months to get\nYour father was part of the plot that ...\nLed to the ... at assassination of a president\nThat's not a small claim you know like your father was once a Democrat [laughter] he killed Kennedy\nYou know and today there will be a really yeah I mean to you right now and and I had a much bigger like white as they were in a small place over a bigger place now the campaign\nAnd you know and today there will be it really yeah you're right now and and I had like white as they were in a small place over a bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump's twenty twenty campaign boasting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nOkay so Washington Examiner a late Sunday evening posted ... ... supporters are lining up for blocks one day before or the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early Sunday\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolated out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between those numb if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns are run you you would have the better you know a better guess at that right\nYeah again here it is a a a Dems midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances\nOf a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal\nPoll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters would prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP the seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap that Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this [noise] it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation [noise]\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats\nI Can't tell you that now I I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because my was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and moving to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike\n... [noise] I don't think honestly [noise]\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do think that we have looked at more [noise] uh as investigators in partisan and we believe that\nI have that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence including with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to giving the money to\nA ... to give it to a fusion GPS gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who\nSaid he got his information his salacious on verified information or I or against Donald Trump from\nPeople close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have at this particular point but I don't think right now\nThat's driving anybody\nTo go to the polls no it really isn't [noise]\nUm ... ... ... ... is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this\nThing if you really followed it but [noise] I [noise] couldn't be there again is that underlying motivator [noise] that's I don't think that's the big\nBut [noise]\n[noise] it could be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now\nUm I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly has become president [noise] uh and they never showed anything for it and\nAnd it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't\nSee it I look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thing and how long for they believe it is and maybe that's currently what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\n[noise] in the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out which\n[noise] I Would make the difference in keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate ... none of that has to do with Russian collusion\nRight ... or the mall or investigation it up right now\nAnd see I don't know what a of a ... report does the if the ... if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the term\nI I don't know what that does a politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that\nOf how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know that no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nAnd ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't think they do it's it's incomplete um what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians\n... I I just because where where it would be the evidence if there is not going to be in a movement on ... ... if it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN\n[noise] a former Washington Post I ride that you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just got to be a reporter it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing entering or I mean most of us probably will never see ... right\nBecause in and that'll be a complete done that it'll just happened in ... right it's it's not the landing on\nThe last two years you had accusations gone just\nAccept for the fact\nThat you have the I. G. are working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz and we've been asking this way I still haven't seen anybody else I\nAsk what ... what we asked why would the White House said it to the inspector general\n... ... we're talking about the ...\nThat is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking about is asking the company has taught by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said\nWise you send it into the IGA and the only reason you're sort of the ideas because you suspect corruption why are they are no links on this is nothing coming out on the story at All right ... when ... and people have just a refresher when rubber when\nPresident Trump said he's going to declassify ... the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice Rosa Twenty one different pages or and\nThen it came out well he uh uh we have some allies that don't want us to ah you know release it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and ...\n[noise] whatever that are meant for it yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it oh\nCorruption and how how to our allies know would be in how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't so why you sent into the ID so one reason you're sending the I. G. is that you believe you because you declassify to have spotted a criminal event and\nYou know that\nIt'd be I G is that you believe you because you declassify to have spotted a criminal event and you know that\nAs ... they ... the role of the I. G.\nAnd because of the power that they have the G can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get within the department of justice and the White House [noise]\nWouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and it's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war which and see what or what you can find in which has\nAccess to every corner note and cranny\nAnd the deal Jay and and since that happened\nWhat almost three weeks ago mobile maybe you and I said what are we missing here is that what what are we missing or nobody else was talking about those are we missing something completely in it right at eight six six Ninety red eye\n[noise] over age ... widow [noise]\nRight now as he and Petro stuffing centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions is on sale for only sixty four Ninety seven", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "22"}
