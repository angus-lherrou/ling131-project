about ... and the way things are going now oh Hillary broader deplorable ...\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't realize what they voted for too you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voted good account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand so that's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody's\nThat it be before you go\nI'm voting for something you don't really understand so that's really all I wanted my own out just to make sure everybody's liberate it be\nBefore you go in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say that everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote I think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way to\nVote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said a knowing the facts and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me\nBut at least go in there don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man\nAnd you know we don't want to listen to ... and so you're the woman I remember that was years ago maybe it is again the vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of course there's another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use the minimum wage laws they'll say oh of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or\nWhat do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nOf job of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not it's a job I teach economics java business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be you won't have any work or they won't hire you or the lay you off or they won't hire your friends\nThose are the jobs of the business they give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat is what the Soviet Union did that's with communism is that's what's socialism is\nAnd as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I've said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people\nYoung adults that the government has no money in the tone it just takes in ... from some group of people in the form of tax and given gives it bothers when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before see conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain a than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice\nGlobal warming of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just see these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain why they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily that the government should do with some bureaucrats shouldn't do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far ... this is tough to be on a ... it it takes a while and if you have the media against her oh good luck it's a wonder we win any election is one of the President Trump won\nWith all the things that against a and let's go to David in Greenwich ah let's see where that is in rented from New Jersey and sounds like fire\nDavid\n... morning thanks for taking my phone call um\nI I guess mine are six quick points on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says and and I get it it's not for what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I like them as charismatic\nThe money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen\nI mean he's a businessman he's a wheel on your show he's hated for what he said not what he done second I I think the people in this country should understand that the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations just like if you and I wanted to start our own red\nEye radio corporation political party we could do it too so when they take it so personally thinking this is us and this is that it's not an us and them their corporations and the you know that's that's how they listed myself again I think to vote in this country you should have\nTo pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five so you know how\nTo vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties common uh\nAs far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once when I mentioned the civil war and he says it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing simple about it well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly then it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave\nCome a long time in Congress and that's because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves a and you know I'm and I'm just match you question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I mean the bottom of the bus drivers are taking a bathroom break ... at a fast\nFood restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr a or ... or or or Mr ...\nAnd ... at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr or or ... or or or Mr showing so expose themselves to be in the bathroom\nDo they get a hearing from it do they not get a hearing I mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with the Capitol hearing but uh this country's out of control but does it straight now are there could be a civil war where the national\nGuard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone listening and listening out there should understand that\nYou know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this is going back\nFifty years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start carrying ourselves apart internally someone who's going to make a move on us and I appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely no ... you know you're pretty articulate about it the only I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a test\nTo see because uh just because you're going to answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on because I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom those because I have a master's read all of a doctor but I Know people doctors just because they have a degree doesn't make them very wise so I don't think I Want to\nTest for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble but I certainly don't want to test for voting\nBut I I I Know I certainly won't don't want to make it easier like who can a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election\nSaying things that you know or or voting even three months before things happen I thought it was a problem in Florida I think you know where where people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks I Want to be the reason for it I don't want to go out of my way to make it difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they saw it online and they were bullets being shot at them obviously\nAnd bloody some of them to vote and they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color was they held it whenever they were using to signify that they voted\nWe we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here he sounds like a country to take them so\nTo make it easier to the people on a reform to vote same token you can of voting in of course a test of course that was has a bad history in terms of the south terms of trying to keep the blacks from voting and others so that\nThat's not my idea nothing you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMZ and vote well go to the DMV the department of eagles that's\nThat's a chore too so yeah I've got a story later weekly here at the Generation Z I'm giving it away they're not voting because they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe ... through the Internet or whatever\nBut they don't know where to get postage stamps that's that's a true story they don't advocate postage stamps\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to the other caller was talking about\nLet's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on with mark [noise]\nHey mark [noise] ah I don't agree that the Americans in a civil war\nThe vast majority of Americans today or civil upstanding people with very bright my and the reason Trump got elected in the ... the\nAmerican public are disappointed and I mean a a legislator a\nFlip flop elected because he was an outsider empty because he's a businessman and he spend the money that his business\nBurns he's very a proven and he knows when he's in a bad deal and he [noise] I think to a great job with foreign policy I I really admired him that he puts the American sovereignty first a lot\nAre recognizing the international court them up when you get from influences the in our world a like a looming out either do to reverse they ... they're still powerful\nAnd wealthy and as a group they can they want to control the world they don't want a sovereign country they don't want them there they don't want a constitution they slowly alarm\nCould lead to a lot is being infringed upon you know no pledge allegiance and across hot\nGirls are invaded in through that with a Democrat tolerance is uh what else a\nYou may I think I I [noise] yeah I was going to say you you made your point\nWhat else\nI don't know you may I think I I [noise] yeah I was going to you you made your point there uh I don't have to agree with the deliveries necessarily but you know right we have the Europeans who have the whole system now that\nOr scroll down version is also available at Rhodes ... dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue to listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected that said or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker icon for any story and voila just start listening\nWrote the dotcom\nEra currently here for this thing Christopher truckers relief fund if you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't you every year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships\n... but with your donation to the same Christopher truckers relief fund you can help get them and their families back on the road\nDonate today a trucker spawn dot org ... responded dot org give today at truckers fond de\n... am WBRC F.

Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour\nAnd have a drink with him at night and prison regular ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill when he was speaking about the time is it that's the day time does that night we're way past\nThat and you saw us in a ground talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about that\nDoes that night we're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends that he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power and oh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink at night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying as commonplace as we've mentioned this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true\nAnd then he was a called on that he said well it would work didn't it was a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang rape\nThat Dr Ford is not being politically motivated by the way she her owner has suggested Kevin did not deserve\nDid you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right you don't deserve the process of being of the uh\nThe proven guilty just the accusation is not so she may not have been politically motivated afford but you used her you and your masters\nAnd deception used her this is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone named Feinstein's officer wanna Ford's attorneys\nMay have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to lead to harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops and here's my summation and then we'll take your calls and the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks\nHas made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed\nA resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations this is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then\nThat have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it\nDr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct you mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the inadequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest core to the land and try to shorten it\nThe standards for such an appointment of a burden is on the nominee\nThe burden on the nominee to prove that something happened how exactly does one do that the burden is not mad as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it\nOn resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed and it it goes on and on I I don't want to make it to the press but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past\nThe ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations but this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America tell me what you think of all of this application

political gang rape\nAnd that is Brett Kavanaugh\nBoy you had to you in a way with words I liked that alligators coming out of well did you say out of the swamp if you didn't do you think you did you did it very well\nYeah it said speaking of the victims less someone else who agrees with his cell in Kalamazoo, Michigan where I had some cousins or one who passed away recently who lived in Kalamazoo\nAnd I've been there I Love my allergy you had a great place isn't isn't part isn't part of the Portage, Michigan isn't that you know are they all it all around his together yeah yeah runs the I was yeah I was I was there what's on your mind Sally\nWell the thing that that there are several things ... one of them is that if Feinstein really wanted to get to the to\nWin that letter came in a month ahead of time they could have went through the background checks on gun all that she wanted political theater and she knew the me too movement to try to do that and it just made up\nOf fires and unbelievable I Am a survivor of a neat to see it happening to me and I didn't believe by the board for a minute not for a minute\nAnd they use that to make everybody I made a sham out\nOf the whole thing and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just green and I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they did kick carbon I was absolutely does that come out I Can't even ... it's unbelievable to me that you would do that to an innocent man for political gain a complete craziness\nYeah so I understand we're yeah thanks Sally I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when you know is the Democrats turn to a question him or not but they questioned him they just put on a show\nAnd it's pretty disgusting and of course is grim pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or leftist Supreme Court judges and they won big numbers you know we we often are the part where the stupid party in ... in my opinion then the evil part I heard someone else said this\nAnd um we've got to learn that we're in a civil war and I want them to get someone who felt the greed with me wherever they go they may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\nNevada mark and it's I\nI think that ah I've heard a lot of the way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political he said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one thing that the folks that listen to your show could do to help\nPut the ball over the line so to speak for whoever candidate that you want to support is to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to\nSit at the polls on election day and Greek voters\nOr what we found time and time again I've been\nBorn to here to sit at the polls on election day and Greek voters or what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago or is it if you have a friendly face at the polls\nIf you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to do you get a seven to twelve percent push\nOr those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces no it won't do any good if you've got to curb margin that's all grumpy and no one wants to get in fights with everybody the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nAre I always set up a little card table with a bullet candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you could make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller a starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting or [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days off and participate at the polls they could really make a difference\nYou know you you make some good points to the ... that personal touch I've run for office of course in California last\nAh Republicans don't usually win in California but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I seen it in the audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and they almost all say they never have\nAnd when they meet someone and you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote a than Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then we went over to consultants and TV and I think we went astray in some ways let's go to April in New York City Hi April here on with mark on the road I radio\nHi [noise] um I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war and I believe that there's a difference\nThe civil war I think we are going to prove something similar to that but on the civil war both sides who are very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death\nFor what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment\nAnd uh and there are young people they aren't they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized conservatism how organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people as they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist\nWhere all the young kids in ... in school or in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view this screen that oh how can any person as a young person in ... in college\nBe strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people this at the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing to be liberal\nSo all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be aware of the good side they think they're on the good site and they're being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and\nCocktails the windows like some of the antifa is you know group dies but we're not serving our\nRecords were being too quiet and I don't think every groan American that's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend\nI'm going here we're going to protest we're going to go down and I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in there's like ... a protest is but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there\nWith a different point of view we're being like um bullied to just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer oh and and what's his name Cuomo what he just said lately that President Trump he's trying to get\nAll ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened at a metropolitan club I think they\nSaid Republicans they love their tradition\nI did you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it he's he's a President Trump this is the way the the Republicans handled things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose\nTo go after the ... set them up present jumped any no but the kids here this and they believe that it's very serious reminds me my husband watches on TV they asked\nSet them up I jumped didn't even know but the kids he does and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me\nMy husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watches that he's twenty Twenty one and\nThey show how Hitler isolated the young people got him to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard what Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good we will be ... feet and it gets all cheering smiling faces\nThey don't know what they that they're being the hearing propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad 'cause if I knew there was something going on\nAnd I wouldn't be the only one there and the police to be there to protect and make the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know it and we're letting it happen because it trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and play pay less sweat and all these other thing is Madonna\nI mean they're not thinking in school they're not teaching them to think independently in college if they don't think with the crowd there'll be just flashed what do you think did you do that I don't think it's fair because that civil war the two sides fighting equally\nYeah we we should consider to be more passionate\nThat's the first thing I Want to say you Adam teasing you obviously you a very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this is it's not a wonder that students come out and the the liberal because that's all they ever here it's a wonder that any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if your doctor and eat them you get them early then that's the way they're gonna think can be\nExcept for this whoever the president is seems to make a difference when Reagan was president yet more Republicans up the fact that Trump is president and we're having some great success forget the media I Know that's a problem to get those schools\nThat's when he was asked about General Mattis\nA less than a month ago Madison flatly dismissed reports that he was preparing to depart the administration spokesmen for the Pentagon responded to the president's remarks saying in a statement Secretary Mattis is laser focused on doing his job ensuring the U.S military remain the most lethal force on the planet\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley announcing last week she would be leading by the end of the year after touring damaging several towns along Florida's panhandle FEMA chief Brock

the mayor held out hope for the two hundred and fifty or so missing residents who may have tried to ride out the storm\nAt least five people are reported dead in southwest France from violent storms and flooding the equivalent of several months of rain falling in just hours one river rising more than twenty feet making it too powerful for emergency services to get the route\nI'm an care again this is Fox News [noise]\n\nThis is Fox on justice Harvey Weinstein still faces criminal sexual assault charges against two women\nBut allegations by a third woman or dismissed by a New York judge prosecutors did not put up a fight when wind speeds lawyers asked for the dismissal because a police detective may have coached a witness to withhold certain information that could have made it seem like the encounter with wind steamboats consensual this case is not what he was ...\nThe wind speeds lawyer Benjamin Brafman the woman's lawyer carry Goldberg and just the allegations are true\nFan in my mind playing the game I think some of the allegations\nAgainst Harvey Weinstein one of the most powerful people in Hollywood led to the rapid expansion of the me too movement that hit a fever pitch

long it was and she seems very ... of course they hate or for it now\nBut I it's hard to get into someone's mind\nUh who knows maybe there was fooling around going on his high school kids or one of my engineers at a station suggest Louis maybe there's a lot of fooling around his high school kids do and maybe he was there and maybe she made more out of it than it was because he became very famous who knows\nAnd that's the real answer who knows that they're all of this what really happened yeah and that's why you can't\nVote no and that's what I think Susan Collins said you need some corroborating evidence can ruin someone's life or denying the Supreme Court nomination\nCause someone has an allegation that nobody has corroborated it doesn't make any sense and that's why I bet you

President Trump would have a point that they would have been out to get him that's why it's such an hypocritical monstrosity the Washington so such a bunch of ... there was Blumenthal I don't think I mentioned him tonight\n[noise] he said at one point to that a lie telling one lie could disqualify you yet\nHe told lies about his service in in the military it's well known as you just want to talk about that is true and I do you ever feel you're living on another planet I often feel that way I watch what goes on but it wasn't really about\nThe spirit of the letter of the law it was about ... and that's why the ... it was held for months or weeks whatever it was\nA ... you got to know what's going on and that's why and they they don't care if they destroy anybody saw about power and Lindsey Graham at at the best it's all about winning and he says about cutting out the you know what\nA and these were his friends but no it's it's ... it's reached new lows that's why from those just joining us I mentioned the first hour than we have a new civil war going on\nA Web soft civil war or not and it's a it's it's really a fight for the soul of this country when we know what you think let's go to mark in Fort Joni California mark you're on was mark\n[noise] ... Hi Mark I won't forget your name that's for sure I Want to learn about Christine court\nYeah I wanted to talk about Christine poured that Brett Kavanaugh I'm a I'm a former sheriff's investigator or a girl on interdiction the a little while and uh for the import is\nWas doing a lot of things during her testimony that the suspects do when they want to cover up their crime and cover up their life\nShe's a psychologist or the little girl's voice raising me inflection at the end of this that the\nThat the wires technique or body language shrinking her head down toward her shoulders not sitting up straight not what the people in the eye quite you know always up for gays those are things that stuff to do when they're trying to get away with something I I think ms forward as a liar\nI don't know what happened in that room and don't care because there is no physical evidence and have in the country and ah we presume innocence and will have guilt can be proven and there was no guilt\nBecause there is no physical evidence yeah I Am in the country [noise] ah we presume that it will have guilt can be proven and there was no guilt proven toward Brett Kavanaugh any way shape or form and that makes myth poured a liar\nAnd that that's really what she is in California we have a moot point\nFor twenty three counties that have declared that want to separate from California and they're all day and the liars here are in charge of government or they're in charge of every aspect of our politics at last we fight nothing's ever gonna get better\nWell I certainly agree with your ... and a lot of people said this about fighting back because otherwise we're going to lose the country I mean what made this country special is is that risk now left takes it over and good luck\nSo Marty couldn't remind him forget your name no you'd expressed it very well let's go to well here's a good point let's go to Troy in Nashville here on with mark\nHey I'm I uh I've got a little theory you know we we've got these kids and you know there what ten twelve Fifteen Years old before they're released\nAll you There God can you hear me now I can go ahead\nOkay um so I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to what's going on in the world they're twelve Fifteen Years old so these\nKids started paying attention and\nFor the last eight years\nIs someone that would have been spoon fed all this Obama stuff you know no winners and losers in field day now these kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know is Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty year old daughter and they are both hate\nDonald Trump one of them refused to sit down and talk with me at all the other one I got to sit down and and talk with her and I showed her some facts kind of changed her a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that\nLoves straw and he'd go to school and all the kids in his class\nThey they're Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up another mama I'm years I completed my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter to\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and\nBasically and Obama years so we've got this generation and we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us you know so I just wanted to to\nYou know kind of let you know about that or you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids from\nYou you got to get rid of your two older ones just\nTell me about it you know and and that's it you know the other thing about cabin on and you've got this a huge silent majority [noise] um that ... year they're they're\nThey're afraid you're talking about fighting and that's what the Democrats and the the liberals are doing they're I think I'm In the silent\nMajority is you know they're afraid to say anything like that guy you know earlier said that uh he voted libertarian you know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump you know that's a very scare and you've got a small group of people\nWho are scared and the majority and I think this props\nAnd uh all the spin on it is really going to show at the polls with the we've got a huge silent majority\nI'm you know so well\nI think you're right ... yeah yeah no I I think you're right I Know you guys are move me a little bit you know I came on pessimistic about losing the house I don't know just listening to an end by the way you try you also made a very good point\nWhich is and I said this before who the president is it makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that's what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration got a lot of young people all they hear is that side and now with Trump will do we have the media against this which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them in more people like that ... in his own microcosm in his family\nThe ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama and he can't even talk to them I Know that feeling [laughter] I Would have my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran was mark [noise]\nHey how are you using her [noise] [noise] yeah I think\nOriginal argument was whether there was\nThere is no California Iran with mark [noise]\nHey how are you there [noise] yeah I think\nYou're ready to argue that it was whether there was an of a war going on\nYou\nKnow um [noise] it is going on and it's a Cold War [noise] ...\nWhat's what's that sounds that on your end I think we're hearing something on your end\nBut to go ahead ...\n... per year it's a hero aggression or if or is a Cold War or are they the war going on it is definitely going on in the cold one [noise]\nFor for now you hope it doesn't get hot as we see within ... and groups like that maybe black lives matter or any groups that don't let people speak just because they disagree with him and uh what was that the New York state Republican Party or the ... some\nGroup out there a had a sub smeared and a note left threatening them\nWhat's happening more and more frequently and uh I don't know how long that stays as a Cold War you know let's try let's get a good yeah yeah we have time calling in steals whereas in Alabama and I say that wrong you yeah go ahead call\nYeah there is still Alabama you know this killer nine lives in the red eye radio every morning all the way to address [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye
