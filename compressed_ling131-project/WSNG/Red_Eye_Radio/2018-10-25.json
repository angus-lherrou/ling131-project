I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well hadn't Donald that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years\nCan't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made\nThan not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group the the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now are they are capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out there but\nThere is this an and we continue to to fight this all the time or we will get people to call when you guys think that you can convince everybody or we don't know\nWhy that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the ... one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have told the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started all you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you rent for some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it and we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that is the goal the goal is to win\n\nThe goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me in terms of you in life but just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show host for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an Tom [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time entertainment oh it's like sitting on a beach\nSites that are just sitting there and I'm ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their emerging island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay here has cures and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with and you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's not\nGoal look after them on the issues go after them when I was with a you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be the the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the windows closed and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing it so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean massive doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... you can set\nThe messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board\nOr create some more of those economic wins and you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation and they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they're spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work well\nWell you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president in two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night and Nevada ... do well\nOn well almost big was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater Brock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win the ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay can you can you\nCan in Atlanta and I and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side and but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate and get still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it\nBut as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day from what you saw was the shell of the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism yes\nWell except for free stuff yeah yep I ... in art eight six six Ninety read I\nRead your book read are ready to do with a record ...

you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nAnd thanks for taking my call say um I just like to take exception a kind of cheer premise of belief that President Trump's going to have a long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean\nIt can be ... you know he's got three branches or the ... all three branches of government um ... first by presidents come and go\nAh ah okay I'll tell you what it will because we're short on time John I'll tell you what I Am the reverse go ahead or to construction is on the Supreme Court good point yeah excellent\nPoint yeah and I I don't I that's why I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim that we stayed\nOr leave it at about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they've got all the all the answers\nAnd I'll make this is John John John John slowdown we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah saying I made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with Kavanaugh Anne Gorsuch you have to construct right on the\nKnowledge that right and and and when we want we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch of we look at Obama most of what Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you used executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch\nYeah it's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well ... here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent or ... who was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last administration tried they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all over the roads bridges\nRight you know so it's just because\nThe problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know hit it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it's still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they've ... where's that oversight fear in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all I can understand that because when I run it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh\nThat's not what the scent was Washington Post on there headline had it right\nThere headline habit that the powder that was sent along with ... you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that that\nNarrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us it hurt they're saying the bomb was harmless right this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realize oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence in Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb not again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off\nA ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go often would they've gone off or were they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well\nWho would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent pray political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh\nWhen we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't add the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the little person or persons\nNobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing you of something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know the trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nNo sources of said they believe it's the same you know white people or ... or group of people based on the ... which again that the the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\n[noise] yeah if you look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um\nThe the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN or you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts um each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male uh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources that the secret service as a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from\nOh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bombs or not they know right they haven't said that we haven't heard\nBut these were sent from when I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bonds or not they know right they haven't said that we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go on and could have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in in and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they were\nArmed or or or if they were\nAt that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off then and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level of security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real and that that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of inclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n... ... you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety red eye\nSomebody else was gilly McNamara and record it's raining [noise]\nListen to read I radio shell wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or Android more info at red eye radio show dot com and use the key word mobile to keep you trucking cc are\nLearn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself and fears on this thing Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to best truckers won dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nTruck tires things to talk about the unit ... twenty four year old physician tire yes Ellis twenty four and he complained groups and Microsoft I don't know what any of that means what advice your regular where a right\nIran alone I was twenty four as what smart truckers want without the high price risen royal truck tires and dot com today\nWBRC am WBRC F.

later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen\nBut you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material costs especially with steel and

actually signed right or whatever it is the new the new nagging we're not calling now [laughter]\nAll right uh but as far as I Am and so ... has gone up you know we look at there is an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's how many units are in there maybe three four hundred days which is pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slowly as a labor is a material I'd never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer or in North Dallas for video road Bob here's your forecast\nHeavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly you only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from uh the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned in very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I've argued elsewhere the party should have embraced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong\nUh uh you know a Democrat any from a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we've said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five ... just ... they they made the decisions to couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats won open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you wouldn't want done issued them the challenge and\nThat's what it was shown Hussein here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't and they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that\nAnd there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we and brought it to your attention the demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country\nAre blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf\nOf\nIn this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about\nOrtiz in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically\nBut the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you don't want the president wants you know with the Republicans\nWon and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force him and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying well poll well we're going to poll aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own\nPeople from that but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way he's also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunger and flag\n... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here right\nDo you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that now that's Doug was shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat\nWho are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time\nActually to get out of illegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary counting policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level telling me too\nAnd I mean the from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that\nNancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe cliff [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we have and how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans Republicans of uh\nWon't even have the debate why right\nAnd that's what Republicans the Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will be is

here\nOn the events from yesterday the FBI said a last DVD that it had identified seven suspicious\nPackages addressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contain quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages or were similar in appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a pair of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nOr this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest Weber is responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have been permission to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News that the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland water set in a statement that the Capitol police are told her that her Washington DC office was a targeted based suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI\nLate Wednesday the Los Angeles central male facility was evacuated after employees found a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement the LA police department we did that its bomb squad had rendered the package\nAt the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we uh have a ...\nI have an investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we are have a right now a again a the one thing that is\nA bit I I think uh\nAnd then I read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the ... they're not saying that both were harmless right\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source at the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say either way right on that one so\nUh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the Democrats are you know we're picking where well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any\nVery few very and when you're ... we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities are told us already ... the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday\nSaying well it looks like see what you got here and what you've got your okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label on the packaging that went to see Annette\nWell we know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of\nThe the bomb experts that Ron well here's what it looks like still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be or what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people the cry that you know there are the um\nThere are the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time they're ... their their behavior is the most divisive which is compass responsible for this and you have no idea who did you have no idea the auto idea who did it and you're claiming you're

latest poll Missouri scout has Holly up by one ... and that was ten Seventeen and ten Eighteen\nRight guy a buy a buy one um we see\nOut of the last one two three four five out of the last five polls one has been a tie and he's been up and three and she's been up in one or three of those were taken in September a the two taken in\nA ... October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has all the up by one and that and a dead heat yeah it is\nThose were ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has all the up by one and that and a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that\nUh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting per cent of raised to be the main accusation and an ad that clearly is a desperation at\nYeah they were just why not but he drinks ready when he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours you're probably a salaried workers we just did you stay a salaried employee is uh yeah\nIf it is\nOne of those it's it's it's a horrible attempt I hate the contrived well gee you Bob what are you thinking in terms of your vote\nIt's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people who are the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\nMy ... I I Will send in us all I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we we have brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to\nHelp them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry of the particular industry right and and and that is the case in infused farm states\nIt even if you're not a farmer or you know what to do ... yeah right wow you know but you know to you know the effect on the farmers in neighboring very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her saying she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the main stream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know ... or you know with my ... my party in at ... approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men\nHaving the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy\nThe un so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and\nNot a you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme is something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter\nThat you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions\nGo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so\nThat's the effect is that combat one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going look or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point uh come out with Harris or you know as side with as you're crazy Democrats she ... as she just did as having us [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we've talked about it before the vote happened\nWhere does she go on this well she made the choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats than it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no votes she condones that behavioral Lenny we saw\nDuring the cop Kevin I'm proud and and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should thing and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for her you know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back\n... that had made me received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion you have to come in to that conclusion yes\nAlso condoning their behavior is not you
