some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump\nFor his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news for Republicans face you know election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash but some reports national\nTelevision and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters\nGive the president good or excellent marks for handling\nThe economy thirty three percent still raise his performance in this area as poor Trump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic performance\nGood or excellent marks for months ago\nWhen it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June forty four percent consider his performance poor bought the cab yet here\nJust six percent right national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's the point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're as long as we're not in the war you know new a new war people don't care right or the me see uh a survey this is what does this year the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties of for most days in recent months speaking at a high up fifty one percent two weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the president's seat\nOn the Rasmussen poll predictably eighty eight percent of Republicans in Trump is doing a good or excellent job handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the G O P voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve of the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy bump black unemployment is at a historic low blacks were much more critical of the president's second\nIt comes to both the economy and foreign policy\nWhile black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy economic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen\nConsumer spending enough they now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating and here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent black voter approval\nAt record high as well\nSo we were talking about the economic and inform but overall they say from black approval right now I'm at a record high\nYeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question [noise]\nAs it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out you know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but\nI Would assume that would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy\nBut but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about\nIt because there were conservatives before Kavanaugh there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but\nThey're still never Trump or they're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nA number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of them right now so there's that that part of the Republican Party after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real\nAnd we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do there are terrorists know terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies all of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be\nProtecting the constitution because the process is being ... it was it was all the shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh [noise] ah they were given a way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works I think\nTo the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've\nNever seen it in a one thing I just wanted to bring up here because we were talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or whatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news endorsed a better or ... and they claim you know you hear other the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news or conservative Dallas Morning news with\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative and support paid or work number Ted Cruz you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with how many think about this in the media\nThere seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not\nYou're not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the ... for you I could talk ... former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute\n[laughter] yeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of a him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter and which is like the most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um\nA Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case ec ah who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have\nA ... a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump [noise]\nUh I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact that\nIn the allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like a a Donald Trump but I don't like the fact the cruise now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote to say you're voting for ... because because the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you\nIs the most bizarre thing on the planet you could possibly say\nIt makes no critical thinking sense at all\n... you're not a conservative why because as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show\nAnd we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve mhm Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump would Donald Trump was done today [noise] I'd be happy I was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but in the works not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax\nCuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me ... and the ... would you please um [laughter] but imagine\nThat the you know there were a number of things and and imagine even that the economy board weren't growing as as fast a ... and I just wouldn't be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't\nIt's not the we never cheer the endgame you and I are ... the rates is never finished because there are so many things to do but it's what we're looking at right\nNow [noise] Gorsuch and capital [noise]\nI I can I can sleep I go back I can sleep at night while I can sleep during the day well I don't usually sleep will go back to march twenty sixteen them the depression that existed mhm\nThe health that other Americans enjoy the unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitals they should and\nDisability the driver then they lose their studio and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers one dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need to learn how to get up and help\nWe encourage you to educate yourself and fears honest in Christopher truckers fun today I donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to best talkers on dot org let's band\nTogether for a better tomorrow\nOr WBRC am WBRC F.

six Ninety read I was just looking at a Fox News article from Newt Gingrich a ...\n... ... and remember the contract with America that\nThat he had come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with 'cause he's talking about all proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember health care's one balloon issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it as their fault for not solving the problem of help you're not going in with a plan for it\nAnd he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that they\nThat they should take a and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do\nAnd they should have had this a long time ago I Believe you when I talk about this a long time ago when they\n... you know they they got rid of the individual mandate passed a little bit but we said look the premiums and everything else is going to come back to haunt them right if they don't do something this could cause them\n... a Republican accomplishment so they go to the accomplishments you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate of\nThe uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission or as the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited\nTo ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there\nThen they say the Republican promises for additional improvements if the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy\nAnd provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick these legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block every grant right we do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches\nLike high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states the states make a decision as to what they wish to do\n... and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain a lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limited choices the drive a cause for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive\nTelevision ads leading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it up and this is two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah it does sound like\nIt's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's\nBecause a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nUm because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with uh the Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about in twenty sixteen although they were going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the some of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then undid the funding mechanism and then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing [noise]\nAnd we've we've talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen and the end of last year ...\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what then why wouldn't you do that to say\nIf you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a joint by point as Newt Gingrich did\nAnd and it should have been it should've been Ryan and ...\nOr ... this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich did and and and it should have been it should've been Ryan\nAnd the president ... this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylight side of it yet because it's one of the top issues that Americans\nCare of all because here's what I Would say too is that\nThere's nothing wrong with saying look the the Senate by the American people is is shifting on health care and this this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nOr you don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do the Newt Gingrich wrote it because\nYou saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way and we got criticism\n... we are criticism we got criticism when we sat\nThere not repealing Obamacare right stop saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just\nThey were what were they were doing was really what the mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately there should have been the president and and and this is why we have said [noise] that\nWe know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all\n... ... ... so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our healthcare system and this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for and they did not do this\nThey did not do it and we've criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just send me whatever and outside right now because the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any keeps fighting in a lot of people have been told us last couple of weeks the but the like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight and has to be more than just rhetorical ...\nYou've got to take the hard issues and one of the hardest issues out there is health care [noise] [noise] well\nAnd and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that that that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman\n... you can or not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns the number one thing that this president did as candidate\nWas to what they do knowledge well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but that's one of the problems deregulation a no Donald jing what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the\nRight now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily could point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up\nAs a result of a I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to curb what they can do\nIs get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now this choking hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people in premiums and so\nAre you an ad in front of it and when they got out and in payments to the insurance company ...\nAnd and and the the president pointing that out how that's not too difficult you know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't and his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people\nYou know recognizing the ... the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care\nIs well within this will happen until\nIn his mind he believes in Medicare for all right well\nIs well within this will undo unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for all\nRight well and then that case she's going to start talking about 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done because that's what you thought [noise] than you should have brought that up already ...\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah\nNo doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore held let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when really did ... ... ... is that was the cry and then the president finally had to admit no well no we did get rid of all of Obamacare but I mean but that's ... by the way that's part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem that we had with the right\n... we should look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I just you know we didn't know and people would argue with this why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe and the facts didn't matter in that because the heavy cost is coming from the regulation that are still in place the hospitals and employers\nAnd by what you know those those policies and plans have to cover [noise] and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the costs yeah eight to ... considered a matter of what ... six Ninety right I [noise]\n... red on red or the radio
