the FBI will will will clear Cavanaugh\nI'm\nIn the supplemental background check to with this is Bob will be interviewed olive agreed to fully cooperate they will answer questions asked\nAnd an elected give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they previously said\nThis is something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different because you can compare forge testimony\nTo her what she told the Washington Post the Washington Post things could change drastically\nBy the time she testifies and some things did change\nSo\nNow what's different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI bought\nIt is official record after she's testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday she hasn't been interviewed yet not Ramirez has not testify under oath she has been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony\nThen that opens the door to perjury and the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants to the White House reviews or that report which will come later this week and mark judge said he would fully cooperate right\nAh in in this investigation even though he did write another letter\nOver the weekend ... uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors ... looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here\nOr after the Democratic party attempted to have cabinet rested on Saturday [laughter] merely officials reiterated their findings by their standards are worse charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations and additional prosecutors run record setting the evidence is insufficient to merit\nA basis for even a search warrant much less than the rest we said that already before and that you couldn't even get Iran a grand jury wouldn't even indict with all the law enforcement bodies are well\nWhat all of the law enforcement bodies continue to point out as a lack of time and place and while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused and three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description the FBI or will also highly greater amounts\nOf evidence against Dr Ford her if you're applying for miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway second door if it only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nIs a part of this particular process and they'll probably as those people who's running body else we should talk to mhm once they talk to those people it's done\nWorlds do you go you talk to the witnesses\nAnd then at that point it's done so if it's done by one\nDo you talk to the witnesses or and then at that point it's done so if it's done by Wednesday and it's still the same [noise]\nDo you see the ... I cannot see the Republicans delaying it any further [noise]\nNo I don't know that they'll have the votes um if it comes back early ah I'm I'm I suspect that uh that you will have further scrutiny\nYou know and and it could be a Jeff Flake or anybody else but you're this comes down to the votes of those people who were on the fence\nWell if they if they interview him or mirrors and anybody she wants them to interview\nAnybody who's come forward that will likely and by the way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the long is that likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr Ford testimony is a matter of record\nAnd there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case there's only so far you can go and it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the temperament on Web\nBombing politically if they get ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just one and so the Democrats can't make that point\nYou know they'll try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but when they build what's allowed when someone like flake did\nWhat he did will will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way did you see the story too had got a little bit of publicity that ah the ah the weekend poll that came out of the poll that friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn a I'm On tester no no no I'm In I'm In\nMissouri thought well right and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McKay if that if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late\nOr it could be potentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week but I think the hesitation by those senators who backed this\nYou know the further investigation the FBI background check then I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed\nYou did the damage anyway are you allowed the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it\nAnd we don't like is not up for reelection which is why I think it it became more convenient [noise]\nThe the other the other senators likely jump on board a you know and and by the way they ... they did so potentially at their own peril politically flake I had to be the guy because\nHe's not up for reelection [noise]\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine by the way for what a two week about a part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming FBI investigation at the FBI investigation story from the hill the headline\nWhite

kindergarten and if there was any inappropriate behavior when he was in the garden [laughter] think was a ... anyway\nI was ... when you're under a as we understand your we understand your point [laughter] set\nI mean really how those two women a cameraman get in an elevator with the U.S Canada in that building that's what I Want to know ...\nIt's again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you are we're following the procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out\nAnd then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else so you had a ton of chaos five I'm with you but that's it's not I guess as secure as you would think\nEven for senators it's not as secure five as most people would think it is in that sense\nOf all the senators\nIt's not as secure or as most people would think it is and that says\nThe Senate is it with that particular center that\n[laughter] I Know that was the target yeah right right yeah that\nWould be that right up but that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target that they would be looking for or I understand it does seem like you're you're the question in your mind is seems set up a [laughter] I Would have to think that that that that white that white set it up right right oh I just did this or they they could in front of me and they made a good point and so I\nDo agree with them yeah and and that's when I say\nI'm with a cameraman right what yeah what do you know Lindsey Graham of all people of this whole\nWhile at the age it it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point and and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case\nBecause he has crossed the aisle so many times I think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming\nAnd also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum and while ultimately it didn't work [noise] uh in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff like\nIt did it did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general will see that translates in November at election time but\nA pie week from tomorrow by the way\nAlso but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think so I think he's old school yeah you understand what the Senate's roller and you advice and consent\nAnd and as you so that's why he brought up sort of ... ... I'm sure that he had problems with Kagan and sort of my ... and the things that they believed ... but that isn't the job to job isn't the job is to say as a senator was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\n[noise]\nJoined the conversation using the shell wrote several hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three night radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nAnd at the desk ... we have hundreds of flat bed specialize million mile drivers\nWhy because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you as a as a family of sixty locally run sleds bagging specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your ruse\nYou on short haul or long haul [noise]\nWant to drive our late model drug for your own trying to do you like to drive shown over as a team about the challenge of specialized loads for them the desk ... family of companies is your million mile hole if\nThis along with consisted miles great ... and Tom deer benefits sounds like what you're looking for and go to Dr ... dot com and learn more about our family of trucking companies\nFind them flat fairly specialized opportunity that fits your knees at Dr ... dot com\nThat's Dr da ...

as a the developments on Thursday came out the centrally she Iran must and his lawyers early in the day had reached an agreement\nWith the SEC\nSaying and and and and apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to happen to them by the end of the day there were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it uh this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take the\nCompany private and that he had access to fund a he had done that some time ago and\nAs a publicly traded company the chairman of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on route\nAnd that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it was a secured had been promised to him or any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private [noise] that I started this whole thing into okay\nAnd then of course the or some other things that he has done on social media that question his ability to run the company but this is special because you're manipulating the stock price or the company\nUh it had a jump when he announced that the stock price at a jump because it was you know people investors if it were true might have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they draw\nIf it were true ... might have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drove the stock up because he would have to buy out all of that existing stock then it came out on friday which was interesting actually late ah Thursday and friday morning\nThe

Radio Welcome to the show\nWell thank you\nYeah my my uh my thoughts on that uh that the judge Kavanaugh uh the the old Bolshevik like Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer even at the Lowes they\nAre they're going to continue to attack him a even after he's confirmed it as a Supreme Court justice I'm sure the\n... and I have another question\nIs where they they made but it's not going to go anywhere and no one would let her know once just once it's done I mean I I think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him that's not going to happen\nNo no that's not on the back of the Israeli there's nothing that's going to happen Rob the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I think a move I I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control\nI I see what you mean yeah the the lip service that is where the attack is the parent is is the lip service and I think that they'll continue to add and that\nThat but that that's the norm they call that\nTuesday right they'll they'll they'll attack him when there's a Supreme Court decision I don't like that when he was on her door to give\nIn on something right on funny because Mario uh uh Gary and I were talking during the break about the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself\nFrom any case involving if he ceded any case involving a democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the [laughter]\nWell you know that I can I can make the case that if you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or or or vice versa or\nI'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person in the case [laughter]\nIt's worse or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person\nIn the case you should read humans yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defender's edge of your game you're not a person making the point you have no standing or wouldn't be interested in Congress ... played one of the interesting conversations that got I got an over\nThe weekend with a with a few other people which was well how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have\nTo be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty what is it fifty three fifty four Mm genders uh the the that are out there and then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of why don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFor video road here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today\nWe'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana\nAnd so everything along the line of who paid for the the ... you know a ... ... ... lie detector uh the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\n[noise] and [noise]\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind as it as a dead he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that now\nWhen I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he found at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left ... remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't gonna run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be or the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday she was being called out [noise] and even after he decided to go to the White House basically and asked the administration request demand really [noise] but he was not going to vote on the floor [noise]\nHe would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out\nThere were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still [noise]\nBecause they if they believe in this to my approach is never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together Republicans coming over to the left [noise]\nThey don't hail Joe Manchin\nThere's somebody who is a bipartisan a wild technically he is\nHe's not getting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean I've heard McCain was Hitler after he ran for president for and then went away and was no longer a threat [noise]\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the law but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\nAnd I do very good [noise] and I say more bloody and brought the investigation I started to find out a little more about this stock their high school college oh heard have that\nOh you mean expand the investigation on her\n... upset about this is so hey this is this better just as bad as the shooter Vegas there's nothing about it than I Will not you know nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on an forward we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about Kavanaugh than you are going to know about forward but it's a it's it's coming out ...\n... ...\nWell if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] well if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check\nSo the I guess the the the players that have been named in\nThis so far you might not be what the FBI limits themselves to a ... and and discussing it with Ford or according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she still not yet been interview [noise]\nWell my question is\n[noise] you're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on you start with Kevin ... then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony [noise] you're likely going to go and and interview maybe even\nFamily members somebody who could back it up because what you're trying to do the idea\nIs to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims so there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat could be interviewed during this process\nAnd that might not be good news for Dr Ford\nOr her attorney smaller the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Gail who said no he he drank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove ... that's\n... that's the bad plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically there's this old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right [noise] so we'll see where that goes [noise]\nHow do you perjure yourself in the amount that you drank 'cause you know 'cause I didn't want to buy it you know there was there was no ... and there's no proof\n\nHe hasn't been asked about that specific incident\nRight so it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident ... and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and once amount you talk and your judgment of it compared to somebody else's judgment\nThirty five years ago that would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't know well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and\nThat's now that's not going to happen to them [noise]\nAnd they'll they'll see that they will interview this person\nLike they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was [noise] by that person's claim can be corroborated not just with Dr Ford cleans but what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have\nThose claims backed up by somebody else\n[noise] Marty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\n... yes I'm

I'm Sorry just and it really is I'm Sorry I and we call ourselves idiots so [noise] well it's at ease in everyone's mind [laughter] you know ... talks about a flight calling him a hero Jeff the real year over year really\nAnd and ... went on to say that if I were up for reelection we couldn't have come to this agreement to call for the FBI background check investigation which tells me that you don't care what the people of Arizona think well he's but at least that that is a moment of honesty mhm [noise] yeah\nI wouldn't have voted this way if it was my own if it were up to the Peter bent would if it was my own posterior on the line yeah if I couldn't get if I was running for reelection and knew I couldn't win or I wouldn't do this\nRight wow it\nWhich is to say I don't care what the people say of my state and I'm only in it for myself haven't retired he's not retired yeah\n[noise] he still supposedly serves the people of his state [noise] no he admitted that he does not ... because he knows and Senate\n... there was no way if he were up for reelection he would have the political currency to get this thing done [noise]\n\nA lettuce head gee you we go to Terry in Georgia Terry you're on Radio Welcome to the show high\nThe ex Joe ... great show great show first time caller here I'll be brief but I might have a real problem with a ... it ... the Democrat actors as well as the Republicans was giving the doctor so much praise\nAnd to me it was it was there was no competition to me she seemed like she was just totally full orbit or harm education or [noise]\nUm she didn't come off as being too broad a for one thing\nI'd say myself and this was the theory that I'll be brief for you and you guys talk you talk about it but I'm sick and she was from the get go I I mean even though\nI think cabinet all was ... just happened to be the one I said she was on the on the road getting ready to run with federal with with that which would you nominate\nA guy that um it's just that she was too much ... when she said she believed a hundred per se but it was traveling All right there and there I mean\nI well I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible is because you only remembers one thing\nI mean well well I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible is because you only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love to in a never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible out [noise] forget about the fact\nThat her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names that backs her story\n[noise] but the fact is what she says her so [noise] if you just came and you'd say well look how can we remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible\nMhm [noise] yeah I mean that's\nBut it doesn't matter and that's the attitude on the left which by the way it's it's clear it doesn't matter because they leak this\n\nOne's even try to defend the right one and there are there any way with it yeah it's a great point they're just ignoring the question\nOr are\nWe now a ... he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on a biggest will he called for an investigation and we call them or one Yeah Yup\nLet us go to Lee in Chapel Hill north\nCarolina Lee welcome you're on Radio Welcome highly\nThey're\nA good show and you're listening to thanks I uh ... strolling in Portland um Ford last week says she couldn't remember\nWhere it happens all\nThe ... I think she said she couldn't remember what year it happened if I Love steak right now she got there actually I don't get mad\nCode I needed to only dance or they all also kill a little while she had one last away\nWho are for the yeah you you would have to you without a doubt you and may laugh to weigh in Las Vegas lawyer would have to\nYou would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats aren't as ... as I said very easily I that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to bakar up when they say she was credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this isn't a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through but when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't\nKnow how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know all you know as\nHe did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave\nA stock credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't know if somebody is that the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos lesser question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer you want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the\nWhich we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it\nRight there in Port in that there's an expectation [laughter] remember\nWho ... who who wants to who asked to Obama the follow up question or was that was that ... that was here\nIn ah in there was ... was was it oh no yeah yeah yeah well there's two separate ... okay or one where you have a local reporter here uh from W F a a TV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be ...\nThat that is that if you asked a question did make sense to be a follow up question by that that there's actually an and this is something that has to stop this ... this kind of was sorrow world respect that we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I\nAsked you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down and write to it and say you're not answering my question well I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I\nPhrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre world respect but a journalist is supposed to give a a politician who won't answer a question on an issue\nWell it's just supposed to give a a politician who won't answer a question on an issue that is the reason that you brought them\nOn the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're going to be got Liz go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them and and [laughter] you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up all you know because people like well Stephanopoulos when everybody else allow them to get away with\nThe\nThe person especially a public servant was being interviewed does not dictate the questions I don't know\nWhat would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question ... well and that's\nJust [noise] they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just stayed it we're going to help this person build a narrative here so let's talk to the let's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking [noise] oh my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the\nEasy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I would've said okay so you're saying the Democrats did like\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did lakes is\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people read it at least frustrate the daylight Saddam ... this is why people hate\nIt no but you're going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they were on they knew they were going to face tough questions or remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they\nDo is is if you do that you become black bowl\n[noise] [noise] yeah they won't come on your show any more because you demand that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be yeah when you come in with look when you're a a senator and you come\nIn to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House when you go on a show you know while you're going on the show they'll tell you we want to talk about this and so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need\nTo figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster we the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's with is CNN\nThey all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major\nYou're not going to get the major personality is any more think about this we live in a society where the media believes we need to get the manger personalities on the major political personalities who run and drive this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\n\nFace the nation you know his face the other way [laughter] [laughter]\nI meet the press that west pressed the mean we're going to do a handshake ... that's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican\nAnd this week is weak this mhm\nWe there\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nYour mom [laughter] I might as\nWell be having that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that you're a mom\n[laughter]\nUh yeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it why not just make it I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of grade school Scrabble reduced\nYou would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of grade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words ... you got to make up a word nothing could be a real work work\nAnd you got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board and as long as you use that word [laughter] okay so that's what I Would just make it a game\nBecause that's all it is just back nobody's taking a the their constituents are seriously in the case of Jeff like he didn't care well ... ... you know how she could answer it [noise]\nI don't know I I don't know who would yeah I don't know like you're asking the question I Can't answer ... why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know ... that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an ... [laughter] ah\nBecause various or not or a very observant yeah yeah\nAnd it's not the Democrats you might think Mr coups and all of you may think that Jeff Flake is a hero\nI'll say what I said earlier on friday is a long ways away Trump just got back into the game [noise] that can often be\nVery dangerous for Democrats eight six six Ninety right I I\nReally really bug more readily radio with a record ...
