show\n[laughter] I guess let me show love talking to you I just wanted to give something about a recollection of memory about five years ago me and about six guys would go down to the coast of Texas on a fishing trip\nTo police officers twenty souvenir bedrooms thirty year veterans two guys that wasn't even a part of the group had joined the group one guy were out on the boat talk and\nHe remembered twenty seven years ago he put two and two together that I put him in jail for carrying a non lawful weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nThe man remembered that because that was a defining moment in his life and all I'm trying to say is this woman\nIf that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh one hundred percent on top of her she cannot tell us how she got to the party how she got home\nAnd\nYou know if it was such a defining moment in her life how did you get home where was this house that would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment\nAnd now all of a sudden it's just let's move to go post maybe she did maybe she didn't but this man has been nothing but exemplary his whole lab and for the presumption of innocence to be just thrown out the window by the Democrats are just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible and see you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exists\nAnd their testimony and when the ... or whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there and when those witnesses or act as the ass and say sorry we weren't there don't know about it a bad at all and even one of her friends\nAt that point your credibility starts falling apart and we don't know\nThe where the win or the hall of\nEverything surrounding it yet you are a hundred percent sure of the perp adept at that point you have problems that you enjoy credibility problems in any case they might not just this case in any case you would have complete and total credibility problems which is what the prosecutor\nSaid this and this is what it comes down to is is uh can you put a case together based on all the evidence and and it does again it's not a criminal case so it doesn't rise to those standards but it would be very different if there were a number of people let's say even two or three other people\nThat work at that party or had a\nFirst hand some kind of first hand knowledge of that event and their stories\nMimic what she was saying\nNow you still go through that process and you which is exactly what the FBI is doing has been doing since last friday or Saturday but this is what you this is the process of building that case\nIf you don't and and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but that has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used and said these are the witnesses these people witnessed it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will\nHave you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know in in you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say\nNo I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating no I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want\nBecause she is using the she is using the polygraph as cooperation that there is credibility to our accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify [noise] the lie detector test was done in a legit\nWay right now and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right now and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to again because she was always telling the truth right her attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act\nOn investigative leaves leads they\nHave provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh quotas is inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are Deborah cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials and our letter obtained by political\nUh again it's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talk toward the end\nAnd also then we'll wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they won't they if they don't understand why they would not because it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background\nCheck on Kavanaugh and so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or tapping on to get their statements because they have their statements\nBy the way there is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys\nDon't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who they don't including people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with this\nThe FBI may be doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her this is a background check on Capitol it's about her claim\nBut she is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does there there is a no there is no right for them to be a part of the process\nFor them to be included or directing the process I Know they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera\nBut that's not how it works with a background check process or you may we may not ever know the American people may not know Kavanaugh may not know who they talked to who they interview\nAnd and political here I'm renting from keeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background check as the timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney sought a call later Tuesday with your officials to discuss the investigation you don't get to do that now it's not an investigation it's a background check\nAnd it's not about her it's not about Dr Ford it's not about it's about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they're going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process she\nDoesn't get a copy of the background chat up only the senators do that's right and\nUh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI's final uh findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer pressed for the public release other redacted version of the report for Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background\nI write a which will be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week I'm Kavanaugh's nomination according to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report\nIn a secure set in after the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed his Singh said I think it will be sooner\nThan friday but I don't have a an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you'll have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive release something or have\nHorror a partial part of the transcript that would be damning mhm uh you know to uh\nKavanaugh in the context of not to complete a paragraph or sentence or whatever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know or at least a holding released the entire thing so I'm\nA\nCity\nYeah I think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation as as the report came out\nLate in the day on Tuesday that the investigation is winding down then by the way back\nDown Jack ... yes [laughter] thank you well know but we know but my point is black was the record investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is raising it yes\nAnd and we're joined it's a criminal investigation and it's not it's ... well because that's what they wanted they wanted to criminal investigation\nThat was never going to happen it was never going to happen\nBut keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear directive and and go on in terms of the time you got to get it done in seven days so of course\nIf it's done let's say the the interviews are done with a report still has to be written so imagine\nThat the that that the interviews are are winding down now\nAnd and maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday than the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\nAnd that likely will take what I'm at least a day and they were then we went\nWe we've been told that they can get it on early as today later on today yeah well if you have\nMultiple people talking about it there would be one person one lead likely at the FBI that would compile all of what the different ages found because it's not just one agents and it's not just in one town in fact that they're doing these interviews\nSo it's it's all over the country depending on where those subjects of those interviews are ...\nBut the point being is that it it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's it ... it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each interview\nAnd then the the lead would be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I'm guessing\nIf you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety ride I\nEnjoy ... radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell roads

Bush [noise] and they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut remember right rhinos rentals started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was when\nPaul Were really came to the fruition especially when McConnell and banner there were same weren't topping off and the budgets when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone wouldn't that was it that ah that that the uh\nPaul Ryan proposed\nThe balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty oh that that was a that would have been a pretty that out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when you know a of\nOf ah twenties well okay it was the summer spring sort of only get so it was before this one and two of election but yeah\nAll right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical you know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right\nI mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the the president credit [noise] uh in fact I I think that\nFalls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because you and I thought that was never going to write based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending ... rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger\nAnd created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending ... from the the campaigning on twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that\nRemember you know you and I sitting here late at night when painter came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shot down the shutdowns of never been about tax cuts the shutdown spend about spending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were called rhinos who recalled the swamp\nTrump was coming in to get rid of the swamp desktop to send him to stop the sand and even going out to the the uh the school lunch program\nYou know in the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything right on and so when you got goes back he's so much for when he got twenty Fifteen and you know and and\nA ... a banner was leaving and wind was coming in Bangor didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans ... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected or Brian\nWas to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he was automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the the the president back then\nYuri as they wanted him out Trump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos off the swamp out we've got to cut spending look where we are today and so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party in in just a you know roughly or three years that's laying well remembered leap\nGo back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket\nFor conservative street cred [noise] remember and the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate it was our final question to\nAh the light of Andrew Breitbart ... you know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was that was still early but it but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know that I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nThat he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on\nHis answer basically was ... because ... which by the way rings so\nRight now does today is thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words but I think it's important but yeah it's I mean look at history and and see what why anyone swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was everything on ... being a rhino and\nVina but now it's changed mhm but back three years ago yeah swamp of the state now but yeah a swamp is deep state a swamp is what's going on right now in the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over no nobody's viewing McConnell right now as part of the swamp well I don't think no matter who's a Republican leadership\nThe swap if they had done if they had ... and and the green to a budget that they did this year and last\nYear three years ago these are Trump supporters would have been absolutely\nUp in arms these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution it's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation aboard the Republican Party has gone you know we're you know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of\nWhat those terms meant back three years ago and the fact that the definition has evolved completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is the Republican voter I don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to talk we're going to ... we're going to cut as to where they are today because they're simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file Boehner has gas\nIf there were pressure at there were pressure right now\nOn spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all that would have been done it would've been a priority and the president is not wrong for ... focusing on national security and and border control but it's part of the again\nWhere's the mindset of the voter that's the question the mindset of the voters that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away\nWe just want the\nPenalty to go away and we said look at the ... look look at the polling from five years ago a until they were discussing it last year\nAnd you could see the I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes\nAnd the mandates and let the benefits we like yes well as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no\nBecause there was no bad there's no there's a small core and so what do we identify a senator and a half\n[laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it and maybe twenty

the three countries and setting labor standards and some ... wages in Mexico\nWhat you're doing is you're going to be driving out the lower\nUh the the the the lower worker and expect to see a ton more automation coming to Mexico and the United states lower skilled workers will be again\nRight I Love lower as we look lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked and they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because fewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada\nAnd that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's ... mangled we talked about this yesterday was to\nHave [noise] companies in the United states producing it here in selling it elsewhere\nWell by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite right there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell make cars here and sell them elsewhere and because of all the rules and regulations we have put on cars and all of North America and Canada and I have to say North American than say Canada Mexico\nAnd not in the United states because they have changed North America to that in the actual\nName of it and and so you know we discussed it a yesterday I ... the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt car production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico but there's something going to say fine you're gone automation [noise]\nYou know automation a that comes in ... comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to defeat all the\nCost of the regulation from government in the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now\nHe's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating pardon well keep in mind in two thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash their\nTheir foreign arms their foreign business was what was\nKeeping them alive you you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them

the time I drink wine or fall asleep\n[noise] it'll blackout you fall asleep [noise] a lot of times when people drink wine at night\nOr in the rural and fifty two percent said there is by is the fact that you have sixty six percent of American voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway [noise]\nYou're talking about again the independence there are those are independence and her saying okay a notch or maybe I don't think so but\nYeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American of voters favor\nA that an investigation where we are right now the FBI report could be released only to the Senate\n... ... it will not be made public unless it's late ... uh uh uh uh yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency ... the first time they screamed transparency\nAh regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so or you know it's interesting that seems like a after\nTwo years Americans are paying attention and fell into the Russian investigation of sixty five percent of Americans mold\nOr a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started ... a is a is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said that believe that Trump committed collusion\nAnd they want to find out what my ... and they're willing to release it to ... to ... that he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nA you know beyond that uh that typical party line number of just strictly you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which means there's likely a ... a few Democrats are liberal\nMixed in that and who knows why they want to but yeah maybe they think\nThat it's going to show that he's guilty but we've been we've been saying that it doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparency\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to uh we talked about earlier because we had received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week and and this is the because we've been getting some question said what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant application and and and those are\nTwenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from listeners saying hey just disappeared president says gonna declassified it disappeared what happened\nNobody's talking about the story right well we did a a early last week when we said because we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guys just started talking about it casually on the air and saying I mean what in the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know you get it because what what what they're saying is okay\nAh there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies\nOr we're going to release it ah but ah we're a ... we have so much action for our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the same in an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret mature\nBy the way we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence\nBut that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because his former CIA director and talking about OK what our allies subject to which we heard was was a Great Britain and an information on Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still started thinking to ourselves wait a minute why wouldn't go to\nThe inspector general inspector general ... we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption ... oh\nYeah so when the un redacted version\nThey have found information that they wish to give to the inspector general of the United states whose or ... to the inspector general of the department of justice and whose job is to find corruption and the abuses in the department of justice\nBecause you look at that scenario imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that certainly uh you have Kelly in the room\nWith him and then that advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I could see General Kelly looking at us and and the president clearly looking at this going okay if this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration\nIf that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here\nThan this actually will require Horwitz the inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes spot\nYou take the politics out of it\nBecause you let the I. G. to all the investigation on it or tell us what happened here because the I ... going to have\nAccess to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know ... echoing a the the uh the ... and\nAnd the death of a new noses of the world and calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that\nGene has access to it directly yet\nSo the gene takes this and the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this uh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president\nWhile the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to classify that that's not the issue you take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents\nBut the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice and any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years\nFor the president's call for that and for that to\nTo be handed over and you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation\nThat you're selectively yeah just declassified part of advice because when you give it to the inspector general\nHe's going to cover that part of it okay what are you a context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about uh uh that you know Devin Nunes has initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody\nHas gone quiet on this you hear nothing and\nThe media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen\nOne story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general why is the inspector general looking at all this they only have only looks at corruption right that's what he's learned he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general\nWell did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right and so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say what Russia probe right ... ... which one which one because I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia probe\nWe initially thought you know to because I'm On the one time they said well mothers in but there's this limit for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian pro right and I went oh that must have been more investigation\nOne time they said well mothers and but the this listener for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian probe right and I went oh that must have been more investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be you know it may not be the investigation that they're talking about you didn't by Mahler you said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the pattern of behavior in the in the entire\nHistory of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right and what was that pattern of behavior\nLeaked to the media\nHow many of those leagues favored Trump or almost or maybe exactly zero zero so you have this situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if there's an redacted classified material\nHad damaging\nInformation about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging\nOn Trump and if that were the case would he also turned it over to the inspector general if it were because it\nWouldn't serve him politically I don't know it's not required to turn it over to the ... right but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any information", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Torrington", "day": "03"}
