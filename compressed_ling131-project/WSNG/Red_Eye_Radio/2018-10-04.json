that they write this the same day that you know do the same week that\nYou know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAh and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet is part of you know ... isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing he's he suffered from that can believe that we've

mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd in supportive of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that it builds alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump\nAnd now they're fighting with each other [noise] because when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol the

a great point spend twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization from\n... from a I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump ... and\nDon't like where the Republican Party is going where they realized we\nUh we got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation\nItself is enough to destroy someone's life this goes beyond a political issue it goes to one ... one Trump ... the election it is [noise] the it is the culture war but it's also and and and\nI say a culture where because it's a war on\nIt it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look [noise]\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never on that never I never got about ... we voted for a ... or you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see a ... rallies\nGoing ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why and we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not\nEverything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that many friends [laughter] I think I Would only vote for air as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election than twenty six being you know well uh you know I guess she wasn't your first choice if he told the interviewer will know my first choice was me [laughter]\nAnd and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back\nTo many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the left or you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that our number Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this I mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat were you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there are actually\nPeople out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have\nAnd now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a\nOr listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to this point to the actual election it's a binary choice [noise] [noise] it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and\nI think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa you know who you know when when um [noise] oh ... who was it a try to think of the the the the person [noise]\nOh yeah yeah it was a ... member it was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah uh\nI thought this would because I I ... I saw that a\nA Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media and a lot of people furious excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol a and and uh\nAnd that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now ... well except for Bill Kristol\nA A N and does that does Jonathan is it ... they're at\nA use it on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox Business news as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that what came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right\nBy the way that was after [noise] the the the house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report on ...\nYeah so I I think that's you know what's happening so again uh you look at that and you say wow liver looks would Republicans then\nI see this Washington Examiner\nA which is eight for anybody to know a very conservative outlet a GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending sooner ...\nFive weeks before the critical mid term elections House Republicans are outgunned and out man as a constellation of well sourced democratic groups dedicated to winning the majority\nOverwhelmed GOP defenses from financially flushed superPACs\nFlooding the zone with advertising to grassroots organizations directing money and volunteers to targeted areas around a dozen political groups are feeling the Democratic party to flip twenties receipts and capture\nThe house on November sex in a toxic environment driven by discontent with President Donald Trump the barrage has become too much to handle for the two groups\nManning the barricades for House Republicans the national Republican congressional committee or official campaign arm and congressional leadership on their designated superPACs are guys are taking a beating\nSaid robbed Sims a Republican consultant a and former and\nAre cc executive director said Tuesday in an\nInterview with the Washington or an egg examiner or and so I mean just your you go through this whole article there they they go through it specifically you know the money that's being spent by the Democrats and the vulnerabilities we're there to the point and these are the people the money people behind it saying\nWe're going to be swept by the Democrats so which one is true ... well ... and and there's what yeah that's why you have\nThe election right exact election and and remember I'm a Casio Cortez her opponent spent a I think it was somewhere around three million\nAnd she spent right merge early enough yeah money doesn't always when you you know it it is the message is also the motivating factors that we've talked about and clearly Kavanaugh one way or the other I mean it and and I I Would agree with the peace\nTo a certain extent a written and then uh at at our CPA and I'll get the author here in an intimate or they deserve the credit ... but the idea that\nYou know it's theoretically it could benefit either side you know to a certain extent again but typically what do you see historical ah there's been a\nA younger demos turned out for the primaries this year they don't always turn out necessarily\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind read the stories to you will listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of vote your drivers is now available for free as an F.

[noise] um and you can make no if you're a senator looking at it but your notes will be secured in the same way that the forms will be and those forms are highly secure so\nThis is how it's going down and this is the procedure there's one copy of it it's going that one copy is going to go into a room\nWith the senators the GOP will have an hour with the the Democrats have an hour with it we were told it was being widely reported that they were looking over that a late Wednesday evening I'm the report from the hill a earlier in the day Thursday Afternoon into Thursday evening was that they would review it on Thursday\nOr but the report came out that they you know it was the senators had\nIt and I assume we're reviewing it and taking that time to review it or at least the G O P might have been\nA as late as a Wednesday evening so that you could pour over into Thursday now there's been some some concern there and of course protests by Dick Durban ride a Democrat to whip a he has been\nWell I mean again you look at it and someone making a claim [noise]\nAnd and the problem is is that the ... claim they can't find anything to back it up the left screens for an FBI investigation well that wasn't going to happen but it's a supplemental background check the president agreed to that you know I was watching ah Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the\nPress conference on Wednesday you know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking you know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question from a female reporter\nWell why is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse and the Catholic Church and those are those who are claiming that they were abused were men\nBut yet he won't defend any women [noise]\nAnd those are those who are claiming that they were abused were men\nBut yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question [noise] and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers or wait a minute he he's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating\nIn this entire process\nSo his comments or the rally or were factual base but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims you know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left at once again has created their own little fantasy\nThat these are credible claims\nBut sorry in this setting there or not if you can't find anyone to back it up eight six six Ninety red eye looking to purchase your own

I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that because the ah Republicans\nMost likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim for example is Adam Schiff\nHas done all along and Adam Schiff firms and not on this but Adam ships as we will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell\nA out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which\nPaddling was but uh in in touch closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat\nThe Democratic national committee's lawyers\nRight before they got the warrant\nRight and and and James Baker top FBI official or at that time which without question shows the politics played a part any talk to them about what was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion\nInvestigation that was going on which is absolutely the wrong thing to do right\n... you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I asked questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know the thing is every question that we asked about where this where what might have happened\nHere in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on\nHas come true it is all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right ...\nUm that [noise] [noise] well first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross ... abuse of power under the\nPrevious administration that that uh a person or persons knowingly used false information to which is the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um\nBut they they in soliciting for that Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling of the top of the hour my point that Adam ship is though Adam Schiff has claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats\nAre the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it and they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans you know uh it uh in the in the Senate want to keep\nA this\n... rural and the fact that hey we can't be ... ...\nYou are in the in the Senate want to keep a this ruling affect that hey we can't be ... every background check we do have our bridges ... of every judge we're not going to do that and so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nAnd the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours\nThe rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...

up in the FBI\nWas actually connected adopt them so it's not evidence it's not email you know it's it's not evidence of an email\nOr a text or anything like this is somebody testifying along with other read that in the right before the election [noise] a top member of the general towns will be FBI met\nWith the law firm of the DNC\n[noise] a top member of the general towns will be FBI met\nWith the law firm of the DNC who initiated being higher monetary transaction to get dirt from the Russians in order to destroy the Trump campaign and then destroyed the legitimacy of the election you've got somebody now\nFrom the FBI that has connected that dot [noise] that shows the politics I played a huge role\nIn in the entire investigation and work goes from here I don't know where it goes with the inspector general getting the ... you know the unproductive advise application we will find out for video road log here's your forecast\nAs we predicted those showers for today in the desert southwest have tricked northward we'll see most of the ... now beyond the state of Arizona and\nInto the states of Nevada and Utah Salt Lake city central receive heavy showers today up and down I Fifteen up to I eighty four near twin\nFalls will continue to see showers from that system known as Rosa north of those showers will pick up some snow and mixed precept for central Idaho over through central Wyoming Boise idaho has a Seventy percent chance of showers today\nBasically the petition or to invoke a for cloture or that has happened that happened Wednesday late Wednesday by Senate majority leader a they basically Thursday ... is a just a kind of a blank day although it will be about reviewing the documents and\nFriday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote ... been closure for those that may not know is basically just ending the debate and discussion on it and and saying okay now it's ready for a vote so that vote would happen I'm assuming if\nAnd don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them you know with what the headcount is for the vote and\nI I doubt they're going to want to delay\nA much longer after that cloture vote\nIf they get fifty or more we're going to Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nThey are good that [noise] ah [noise]\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that\nThe whole reason they held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by a claiming that he was kind of partition and attacking them\nOr is that\nThey didn't think they were actually gonna be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward there are going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself\nOr abstained from any boats be happy\nTo be with anything they want to but they they don't and they can do\nHe's ... now it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they they claim it does ruin your cell\nScreaming all day long but they'll get nowhere that get anywhere with it\nOK because I've heard lawyers you know I Try and no show that judges should recused themselves oh yeah bring out our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules [noise]\nUh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were or even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves a I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I\nCan't like lay were an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were saved it down the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if\nI were or there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company that high and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at that\nSelf but to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any more than\n... you remember when they talk about ah you know is nomination this is back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like okay that's the ... she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and\nThe and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but the\nThe\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process not that they make\nThe decisions that we should always agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we'd highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter]\nBut we can talk about that but the procedure on procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court I have a great deal of\nRespect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case or it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedures are now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of them and questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with ... often out of context uh they did that with Scalia or but\nYou know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are seen\nThan right now and you know but I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that is not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great and money to make that their their their family\nTheir families used to vacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have\nAnd said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution that there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to\nAsk the judges privately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they're going to the door this is my point earlier about\nWhat I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background check secret and the the content of the three of his secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if there's a if some content came out just imagine that we never her doctor Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay was there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh two\nExcept if they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThan they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well ... they know the Senate knew back then\nThat you take something like that a simple plain that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about\nAll the federal judgeship Salter forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done how many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there\nAnd the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done how many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are uncorroborated I ordered to defeat somebody and never get known to the public eye only reason this one did\nWas because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ...\nWe would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete ...\nOkay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the set of complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because the end\nJustifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is well journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now that puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI the vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official Rio to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never it would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this exists did write her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... ... would not have been able to cooperate and then at that\nPoint it dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation yes and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades\nAnd that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a client now now what makes sense as to why Feinstein for her political white worked to her in\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in\nThe report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six nine to read I\nWas very much tomorrow and Carly ... radio [noise]\nThat the c._e._o. of Paris swaps and

time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nEnd or changed because of change than to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and then in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today [noise]\nAnd
