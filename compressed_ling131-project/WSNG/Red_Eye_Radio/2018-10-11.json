the roads were blocked their their trees are downed\nPower lines are down somewhere active the water is still hot we're working hard you know everyone was among the ...\nUh and uh that is a U.S representative Neal done of a speaking what what a day at a what a day was I Know you and I were communicating back and forth watching the weather channel and other news channels that were uh\nUh uh you know are covering the landing of a of hurricane\nA Michael and I think in most of the you know the video that we saw in and I knew it when we when you know and I'm sure you do when we were watching it we weren't seeing the major damage that was being done in some of those areas because for example in Mexico beach and nobody was there filming\nRight because you you just couldn't be there they wouldn't show that um you know the the the conditions as a Michael came ashore on ah with with a a a very strong at a very strong category for uh you look at a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and\nAnd just incredible I mean just look at the time span of from last weekend up and chill\nOr the storm arrived\nUh the unpredictable nature of these storms\nAnd and how Michael gain strength and was still gaining strength I ... if\nIf the storm hadn't been moving as quickly as it as it was had it slowed down at all over water there's no telling I mean this but I'm I'm confident this thing would have been a category five began to I mean we do they became close to it anyway\nA mile a mile per hour away Riley yeah\nFrom from getting to that point and they did say later on you know the analysis of it they could you know a revisited it say that it was a fiber why lower for right uh I said when they when they get all the\nYou know a data from all the instrumentation ... uh they they could still updated but how uh\nHow terrifying it must be a whole blaming all I've seen so far still report I haven't checked in about twenty minutes last time I checked only one death so far tribute to right and that was a hurricane Michael and that was because of the fallen trees there may be more people but right just as at the moment just one well end\nTo end the clean up a ... as you just heard the representative talking a you the cleanup it's gonna it's gonna take weeks months I\nThere will be structures that will in some cases never be rebuilt a depending on their age and and and ownership a you know you go back in in the history storms like this and there were well very few that that can really equal this\nI haven't seen in any publication and make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it\nWhere you have one Democrat come out and say stop this ... is that this is ridiculous and its\nWhen you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because wherever else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country and we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction and talk about the economy and talk about those things\nOr you were going to say our bases radical left and we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this side we add ... last week\nThere is no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back reverse direction will you we'd said that two letters again really well and and you know when we set an after the election [noise]\nAh you because there is that once they took that break and you know are considered going to the mid west for a moment\nThey came back from watching what wait what are we said before lunch or we're totally not do not only planned to them that we're not doing that um but when you when you go back and look at the history of of basically this this ramping up to this point\nThere at it there at this point now now ask yourself do you think they're going to reverse course they're not going to so what is next\n... where do you go from here\nUh we've been asking that and every time they find a new place to go to because it's just now they're going to get in your age is not going to shout well what is what is beyond that right now I Believe it's a terrible political strategy that's going to backfire\nIt is I think it's already backfiring up but you know this this is where they've decided to go which uh again\nI'm not surprised because once they're only as and we'll talk about this more coming up on the show with a bit later on but there were only two places to go right either moderate and become more centrist and really become more centrist or go to the left and if you go to the lab the only place to go is what the tactics of\nOccupy Wall street antifa whenever right that's the only

I I I'm surprised we all saw him um\nThis morning he was actually streaming on our station in Panama City um\nAnd I believe is from Jacksonville television station um\nAnd um\nHe was in a parking garage yeah right it yes\nAnd and and his coverage or was seen\nWorldwide people were picking them up worldwide and and we threw out um you know the TV station a that would be a W. J. H. G. ah which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went\nOff the air they started their streaming coverage and and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above\nA sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station in our system through and this gentleman in that garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because what he basically did was documented\nWhere he was where he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I just the ... is his name and\nA lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lean a early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing you know the well a calm literally calm before the storm and\nAnd ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope ah for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times\nBut then as you mentioned ah going live later and\nThis is something that again it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us that have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHave been through a storm like this but when you're able to show people how powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way\nHe anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows that's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind\nAnd that's what you hope to do you hope to show people that this damage and how powerful this storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar a Tom this thing right now Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect\nOf Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas\nWhat do we expect them next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect is life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on\nUm to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a a you know the water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia but the Carolinas and they don't need any more water\nPatch rated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would not necessarily be out of the question to to\nFind some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five and I'm a ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise] uh the wins a\nHigh profile vehicles were\nTwelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they are going to update that\nWith a with an advisory they were given one hour advisories this was the last advisory at twelve o'clock eastern time then we'll be moving on to ah just regular a three hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed or as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing\nA probably not by the time we're off the air but twenty three miles an hour a forward speed to the northeast and wins are still gonna be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour or\nAnd so now above the surface where we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet when it's been already clocked I'm\nUsing Doppler radar or at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms in there is one currently ... crossing over highway sixteen which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there\nAnd that thunderstorm\nTranslates those higher wins to the surface and so in those storms they could see guys to eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at a a sustained spate of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five\nOf the speed of wins above the surface and and so\nRight now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states or as we get up to friday morning out into the Atlantic as a\nAs a tropical storm and uh\nSo we're not it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a in a general direction John trout and great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the court or although it will be on the west side of that court or and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nHas some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham and so forth that are\nThat have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across lumber to and Fayetteville\nAnd both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh those areas are are\nWe're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow or to see if we have more catastrophic flooding ... ... we can probably we can probably saved for the next time we talked about turning around and don't drown [laughter]\nYeah right right exactly and ... and you have to you have\nTo proceed with with caution and don't\nThink you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of the water you it's impossible to tell that so it's always best to turn around and certainly a we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale and later John Trump will also join his

now they're just insane\nAnd so people when they look and they say okay you know we're what's what's McNamara saying\nToday okay I disagree with that but ah he's not insane like they are over there I really think that's worth a ... where you you know you're you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nThat I think more people are just opened then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's a rational thought and critical thinking to it mhm right\nWell and and they were and we do hear that from time to time\nBut I don't agree with everything but I yeah I understand how you get their central right ... and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals who call and wants to have a saying in discussion on the issues\nBut ...\nThey're few and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know what they're looking at their party and asking well how do we actually win something and then move forward you think about the word progressive oh that's the whole idea right of taking the country to its next\nStep that's a great point they're still using progressive now things are in the world you know that\nThere's no way you can when they're saying get in your face and shot him out of the building that's progress [noise] the answer is it's not it's the opposite of progress I think\nThe key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks and then what has just come to this week\nWith the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know to win an\nUntil we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments on the substance of the ideas\nThey are lost and it's just pure range and emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe that we think in a in a critic of the critical thinking way and they're just pure rage and emotion\nAnd I just don't even have a debate

just\nA a Tom hale in case you're just tuning in right now are waking up a hurricane Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago of from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile with our sustained winds and heading toward South Carolina\nYeah will ah ah here from Tom uh his take on on uh the the\nThis historic storm as it came ashore but also what to expect in the coming days ah is ah the people of Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of tropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nAlso coming up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day ... and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device or was like two hundred pounds you know uh you\nYou go back a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul ... talking about where the left is going and of course after his attack he knows all too well\nUh what people will do when they're politically motivated\nBut talks about the greater potential love and and he said is concerned that there will be on the SAT there might be an assassination or in a a another attempted assassination or we go back to the uh uh the the the ball field shooting\nOf ... and how that was as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast brought you buy video roadblock\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but\nThe system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia most of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nOnly about two to four inches of rain however as the system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah why why so [laughter] yeah well\nAh to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have ... does does that does that apply the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes no guy yeah wow yeah I did\nI just assume by the time we got ... probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yeah L and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms or you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point that there's a reason to an extent this is the fourth major\nFor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it gonna kinda lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no\n[laughter] yeah if I can and you were right 'cause I\nI'd asked that question which brings in another question that is just to just personal interest to me and and that is when you get it from a you know ... ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean that\nA hurricane like this does it then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes up boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd uh I I guess I'm just letting you know [laughter] not a good or Easter season\nRight I'd hate or the came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and\nAnd and Kate came in hold onto your hat at Mexico beach wow the same place wow\nAnd for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area while\nWhile in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water and the Atlantic ah is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life span the time but Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that\nYeah yeah um it it just seems like a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always often we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned\nWe this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes you know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [noise] yeah\nAnd and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on in in in central North Carolina\nAnd so it never really picked up any news but\nWhen this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach known for and Hampton Roads area as it\nProbably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right a pound power outages there's a there's a huge swath that's going to be\nFrom power outage outages from Columbia\nPretty much all the way up to the uh\nUh Virginia border to at least a pass Wilmington and and just where you started to get into the outer banks islands I'm this is widespread power outages\nThen we also throw in here the tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are\nNormally super cells so\nWhere you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty are heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta well that's not likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where\nThe feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where those individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where we'll have an an up tick in the uh what's called the low level jetstream and wins and we get a little sunshine\nWe're going to see some ... some possible super cells develop along in those ... and\nI'm a John Trump touchdown and he said\nShouldn't have the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm and it hits the land\nOr it kind of drags the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the tornadoes are typically week they're F zeroes an F ones and um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um\nAnd they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm and four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean\nAnd the further north than the quadrant where we see these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm along in near highway Seventy five as\nAs the storm was moving its way through Panama City\nAnd northward toward Tallahassee inland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the uh the the tornado activity but as as this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one\nOr the winds are going to topple trees\nTrees are going to topple power lines a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas and possibly into a southern Virginia than we have flooding and that flooding is going to be a along and through Fayetteville\nTo the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA rally and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of ... and so forth hollers and that all creates its own issue for the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise] and\nAnd then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing [noise] um you know\nIt's a it's a pretty complete storm and it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets outta here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the are heading for the other side of the pond\nA while just incredible energy behind this storm and of course are just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael ... and a bunch of that will still have the assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now that that path that the that Michael took a and\nI were just looking at at one website ah and and the power outages here\nReporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of ... seven hundred yeah uh being affected here and they they send it for some of them it could be weeks uh I I remember my ah my brother being affected they got to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas\nA and they went in they win inland but uh they couldn't go home for a couple of

utilities when you think there's going to be if there's a possibility of a downturn in the economy ... or say people are going to be using\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and an ear it already a one and a half million people already without power and\nThat number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas they had over seven hundred and fifty thousand\nPower outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola\nAnd just draw a circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nAnd they're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas and George and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so\nYou know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to\nGet their power back so I still believe that the landfall area of the pan handle the took the greatest brunt is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean\n[noise] face it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to any more but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure dad the infrastructure itself has to be restored and\nAnd as you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but still is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be a\nHalf to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore a hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot\nLast last hour but you you actually answer that on the spot very well and and were correct and generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific are affected Hawaii but then kept going and\nBut ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier\nAnd it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path Michael that typically and very often we see\nA that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart over land and then we we hear words like the remnants of but they're on them remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc on on Georgia and\nUh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also want to\nGo where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay\nI got an right is it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regain power is considered extra tropical\nFourth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regained power is considered extra tropical but it's\n... you're right in in nailing it here the it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and because it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWhile it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling for those professional drivers out there\nAnd the high profile trucks I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know if they're seizing driver they know\nA that those those are the those sustained winds uh the book whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily\nAnd we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will kind of hog I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that as a main quarter of course\nBetween Florida and New York well and um\nAnd then go ahead to some ... some degree they're going to have the stuff that they are back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five and a twenty uh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta and\nBut there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads of the ... I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington that that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all of those east west\nRoads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nUh it goes in the record books as the number three\nA storm to hit the United states while a and it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Mila bars\nUm just beyond that position number four and the record book happens to be\nKatrina surprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book but what I found really intriguing\nAnd we talked about this yesterday about a continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure mhm atmosphere was perfect not\nIn the last hour it dropped from nine twenty two to\nNine Nineteen ... it was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty and a ... and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning\nShow [laughter] as long as either opt out of [laughter] a hundred and\nFifty yeah why and then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah now the ten I'm as Kendall Airforce base yes right at ten dull as a radar and\nThat radar was queer read as it was coming ashore at um I Believe it was clear read at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed wind speed there a hundred and Seventy seven miles now now now\nThat doesn't translate to the surface but obviously I'm there were probably there were easily guns over a hundred and thirty miles an hour and in this particular storm that made it down to the surface but that's just to give you an idea how powerful\nThis thing is and again I have to thank all the people who weren't went out there and report it uncovered this I'm ... and and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time you know you may\nHave noticed everybody in the weather channel that was out there had had their hand held Anna monitors this time Mr downright yeah they didn't want to have anybody walking behind him with a grocery cart\n[laughter] yeah right exactly you have to kind of ruined the drama if you will because you know and and that's you know if you look at this for\nA storm eight carried on it carried all that\nWell oh God yeah you know and and that's you know if you look at this ... a storm eight carried an it carried all of its drama Michael came with his own drama or it was there was plenty of it you didn't have to go\n[noise] make anything of it it was a storm that joke for itself and its intensity why are coming up or we will ah that we will ... will let you go back and get a nap after we talk to you [laughter]\nBottom of that's our time and and we'd greatly appreciate your work on this and and really putting everything into perspective\nOr as we a lot of people will still be doing in the in the coming days and weeks\nAnd I think you're probably included in that group civil we'll talk with you Tom and at the bottom of next to our library a lot yeah I learned a lot of high definitely ...\nOur will do timing and flash flooding yeah\nWow yeah maybe a Ronald just Tom hale thank you and we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour eight six six Ninety read I I\n[noise] do for for your goals eight six six zero\nVon ... radio [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered to joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThere's not much pointed driving a fuel efficient truck if you have to give up everything that makes driving a truck great\nSo step up to the extreme efficiency of the western star fifty seven hundred ... and get your top back the fifty seven hundred exceed combines western stars extreme heritage with dinosaurs advanced engineering to significantly improve efficiency dependability in profitability", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Torrington", "day": "11"}
