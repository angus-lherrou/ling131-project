employee Monica McLean right that she had coached her to take a polygraph test and then Monica Monica McLean came out the other day and said no that never happened\nRight and update to that story this year just from the last\nHour uh I Believe from the wall Street Journal or the headline is a\nFriend of Dr Ford belt pressure to revisit statements at issue a statement to the committee that she knew nothing about the alleged sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh a print of Christine of Ford told FBI investigators said she felt pressured\nBy Dr Ford's allies to revisit her initial statement\nThat she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by the by a teenager\nBrett Kavanaugh which she later updated just say she believed but couldn't cooperate Dr reports accounting according to people with the ... with the uh the matter\nFor a million with the matter Leland Kaiser who Dr Ford has said was president the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the Nineteen eighties told investigators that Monica McLean ... a retired Federal Bureau of investigation agent\nAnd a friend of Dr Ford's had urged her to clarify her statement like I said who needs a soap opera right the other people said the statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford allies and\nFriends I'm working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident as\nWe're judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh's who Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate on friday has denied the allegations\nOf sexual misconduct\nSo on Thursday day after sending to the White House to report on its investigation and the alleged of allegations against or the allegations against judge Kavanaugh you guys said the White House in the Senate an additional package of

against\nAnd I remember it was about you know we've talked about before is probably about the seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and and it was really a somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... ... do the more professional eating and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man\nWho was a huge fan of my show mhm now I sort of knew her politics were more of the liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black\nMan said he loved our show right think about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went from zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk with you have good to see a a they were stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden\nOver the top rage right with could not believe that somebody of color would be listening to and the more so be a fan\nOf aspirin right\nAnd you remember when it happened and I was like I'm sort of like laugh you know it was like well I I Can't ... this was it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system for me at least right on the personal level on on a personal level some first right on our understanding that that\nAnd and that's exactly what we're we're we're facing because the rage and bitterness I Believe is probably still there today in this person I happen to me is just I I Can't imagine that kind of mindset I have\nFriends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them\nSince grade school and we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics and there was no way that either of us none of us would ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't\nThere's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for many\nBut I'm going to let it wasn't even what I said it was a black man like yeah we talked and I have

though the story came out yesterday a late afternoon that he might not be there because his daughter's getting wedding he will be there yeah I I think\nWas it they jumped on that story a and it it I saw it on the hill a late in the day but\nI I thought to myself\nI ... I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughter's in ... wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that either of those\nTells that are operating in with all due respect to the cartels on um the the whole idea though is that you've got to broaden it\nBeyond the El Paso district right I mean he can win your Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat um and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything\nYou know so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas\nNow certainly he's done better than a ... a lot of the people who jumped into different races uh the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez\nUh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again he's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've got to go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of work he's trying to do is try and do is try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get dumber he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes\nAnd hope to get elected and that's the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to we need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle and\nThen over the last ten years or so no they were you know basically this is who we are I guess my point is\nThat when you think about ten years ago right now\nWhen you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October\nRemember he held open you know would have been the convention where who you are convention ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they\nHad like ... it looked like he was a you know the ... the entire stage it was set up with these ... and everything else where he look quite like some great forum yes\nYes ... and ... and people going crazy\nAnd and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from Newsweek at the time he's gone like yeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country mhm I ride on Obamacare we don't they don't need all but yeah when I don't know we don't need about death\nNo they don't have the Hollywood they come out and\nThat's that's a great point because here's the thing is that\nIs that ugly in inside the state it doesn't work but a work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals who have been pouring money into the state of well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz and an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so\nYou know he wants the liberals basically the liberals to\nAre you guys stay outside of Texas look we've got our liberal places in in Texas a there are plenty of the\nDistricts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here the the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact\nIs he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet but but then the bank and I'm going to hit us core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do anymore\nI don't know that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them\nAnd it only irritates someone who might be in the middle inside right\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base right\nThey don't care right we don't uh\nObama's yesterday's news well\nI mean a liar Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was a hero with 'em over the point is and not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that\nThere is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow that's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim\nOf whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be\nBecause you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor there's the person standing next to you will have a new reason to victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be\nYou here's an here's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my got\nThat liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a bed or work here in the state of Texas I look at I Can't believe we're going to use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing\nRight he just sat up there and he like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God light to pose or in ten years right by the beginning of his his inauguration till the end\nOf his term as president of the United states\nThat is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey look at him and they just say wow okay also need him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not ... as a president\nLike Kim 'cause you and I talked about this and that you know by the by the time he got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... them on sale predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or ... she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party is nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas\nAnd July twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook\nAnd one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march\nAnd was peaceful up until that point of course but they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to live Facebook\nSo I'm watching the thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was ... or yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us\nNothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those cracks in the\nFoundation if you will of the left although we had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American or what does Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us\nTo the left or the Democrats the Democratic party or thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because\nThey may agree with you at the moment the protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause now it's no rational right and it and it always will be that's why the party has no direct line\nRight now that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or gold ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goal this is probably the closest ... you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions ... then then the party is led by them they're going to try and it was every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion wrapping right now unite the Democrats right\nEight six six Ninety run I\nWas very much and regardless it's

but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's ... campaign ...\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season\nWith at least one attorney for ... the Democratic national\nCommittee private law firm\nThat's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then pay the former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the ...\nOf ... cooperated man whenever we talk about the left it's always uncooperative [laughter] not quite ready to raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon ... or\n... or the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins ... law firm and the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen\nTo further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump the interview was one of the most productive ... we've had\nAnd it opened up many new investigative leads one source said another said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI immediate\nAnd it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after\nThe election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate a new\nHow much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld\nFrom the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have\nYou have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you had\nThem now on the record yeah according to John Solomon a test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason if you're investigating Donald Trump\nTo be talking to the ... lawyers [noise] private lawyers just before you got the secured warrant\nRight Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talked to ... the lawyer\nSpecifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why ... why would that be why would that be a ... so that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about Ben I'm sure in the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly\nTo a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg del ... OPEC largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies\nIncluding Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices\nWere meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said uh the key insights this is from blue bird their analysis\nSaudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump ... now we've talked about this because we got we we got to a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war we beat started we beat ... every other country and\nSomebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low as ... ... because there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a of a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy\nSo prices have gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is that when you produce your own oil here and we've become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good at some levels well that comes from an expansion\nOf you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production is key you don't have\nTo have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point we've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion\nAnd I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nI'd give I'd give credit here to President Trump\nIs where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia\n... excuse me we're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding when you're a military were were there for you all the time ... ah and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia the OPEC member ideal pact member [laughter]\nVery avail back that video that member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we've talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat\nCourses nor the Democrats there is no one of the Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit for that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quick\nAnd especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax break knowing he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we had talked about the new NAFTA agreement and I'm\n... started to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look and we said this long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned and ... babies are the only reasonable chair of the original ... W [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look [noise]\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement\n... ... that we have now ... a ... who is leading the columnist for the wall Street Journal\nThe exact same thing in in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a lot like the old NAFTA Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicles that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance they talk to just Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by ... and a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by and as we settle on\nTruck drivers lack the same access to health that other Americans enjoy the
