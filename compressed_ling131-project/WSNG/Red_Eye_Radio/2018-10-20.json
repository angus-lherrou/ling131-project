com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to after this week I'll next to be on October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check it out on my Web\nPage there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word personal want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on on the first segment at least and see\nYour response issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally\nHave come here legally ... which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens one of the calls last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term\nOccupation an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere\nOr loss because if you acknowledge their coming here legally and the argument might be quickly over if they're legal they're not allowed to be here in the store in another caller said that what you know what is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo it was an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lacked the proper documents similarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they would be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was there a cap and they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not\nPermit them access isn't that obvious which is why\nIt is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house\nYou know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no slalom from\nYour change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that seemed to these guys are really clever on the left so the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools even force strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never\nHappen again and you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there were no better I'd taken back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs leave we but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make\nI'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents country\nIs United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed\nHere at Ellis Island they were so happy to have landed at the land\nOf freedom so let's build a wall and do everything to end the legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight

[laughter] that's a great call thing Steve appreciate\nIt very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people\n[laughter] that's a great call things do appreciate it very much\nActually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health uh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know a lot\nOf it it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were hitting someone else's leaving the administration\nIt's tough to work there especially if you're conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot\nTo become president United States you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kinda stuff I don't think he needed that I think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing\nI mentioned this last couple of days of thinking power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after tax\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though I'll probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's what his tax returns are it's just not that their business I Know certain presidents have done on I don't think they should\nIf it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business\nDemocrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I I pay what I'm supposed to pay into my share but from anybody else's business by the way Affleck Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes why to good people exactly why to good people want to serve\nA pay especially people that states why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life yeah\nThey're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those said hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things is limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government and what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they\nSay who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important what's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes it ... this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have\nEnergy but on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military I Can't\nHave a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad\nAnd they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that and there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and\nI didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this house has to pass\nThe Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it and then the Supreme Court\nSo the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it and then the Supreme Court could say you passed a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government so that's\nAnother big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special but most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration gimme call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six

hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida\nAfter that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because they can vote or in in Florida\nI don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had to live in Florida and I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I uh have down for that I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them but I Do have inside in Texas I I think ... gonna win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers\nSeem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like it was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at Florida as more\nProblematic you're correct I ended the numbers\nThe numbers I saw a little while ago showed that uh we could be were behind and the governor's race senatorial race is is also iffy so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side but you know\nI think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about the house to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or tech this but um I don't understand you know I often don't understand why\nThe one when you look at the\nPolitician than they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have\nA ten percent tax if the governor's race one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and you got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are they can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care and they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state\nAnd I don't understand why Democrats don't you don't understand that for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians\nIncluding Democrat in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nI mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight if it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... on the surface if you don't explored\nThe oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job necessarily a and then it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get\nPaying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeat ... but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is why do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway just like now\nThey they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that\nI think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through peach and again I was wrong I was bored with Bill Clinton and what happened you one ...\nI think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through a beach and again I was wrong I was bored with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection um people ... people that don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand\nWith Kevin them I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so\nThey don't the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time so let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national\nForecast ... or ... road law\n... an area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours Detroit so you can look for showers throughout the day\nAnd then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and\nThe thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip\nSo that I have the baby and of course that could go wrong if babies late I guess very late what did they figure out how to take advantage of your dumb laws that happens a lot let's go to a ... Jeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah\nIn Nashville or Jeremiah getting runners mark\nYes sir hey I'm your on your mark are you doing well great I'm well I'm a I recently had a had a relationship um ... she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant\nUm she got pregnant um ... well\nI I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married\nAnd then uh she\n... she left she's gone and it's the fast track to a green card or now the way they have you ever heard of the way they act\nAnd I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um uh you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that\nYou can come here illegally I have a I have a ... you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally just regard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can um you know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause\nMan this this is a few people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant\nAnd then they want to just stay here and and uh it it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience\nUm I met her to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nThat I guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence I'm at I'm so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here has the fast\nTrack to green card um and\nAnd and you know um I Would probably I'll run at a time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a ... George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\n... I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think\nOrange or on with mark\nAnd mark I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and everyone kind of latch don't do but I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we have an in Beijing going out\nThese are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders short or countries and we were being invaded by the failures of these other act\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda and they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America as the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against them President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to a as somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan\nIn while loosing Pennsylvania I probably missed that up standing around with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate\nIt I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped you know enemy territory for a while hopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but um I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back\nAbout Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people illegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and I'm happy to stop that\nAnd if you remember like during the ah with when we were setting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know their thumb purple\nYou know as you couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I would say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter] so we wouldn't have known not only illegals put people voting more than once and and uh [noise] you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over voter id and the other side and had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not\nCommitting voter fraud or voting illegal but you know the oh or being races were made this you know how can you do that yet I by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about a year so the a\nVoter id they make such a a big gripe about how difficult it is\nAnd I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that [noise] and while you're there voting wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get a voter id you're already there so the you take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time you could be starting of voter id form you know the sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know ah you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them\nAnd ah but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them to see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nAnd uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them to see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nAnd then well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... ... often evidently I Know that do but there's another point that but you didn't think of I don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name but Pennsylvania yes\nOr no no I'm originally you know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh Martha and that's you go over to that table you're in the wrong place and they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the literary vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to also gives them cameras to take the picture\nI don't think so but you have stand you ever so that it ideas but they're not going to work as a ... you and they\nTell you one one thing I did have a ... went into vote one time it was a primary [noise] and um I had a they ask them if I can have a right in ballot\nOr right and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in Balad they walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like you know\nTotally me they said well you know what's going on you know and he said well uh oh oh you know you're a you're one of the vote Republican and goes uh or or a Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could see says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats you can't run in his hero public and and why my laughing voter fraud

A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of aging and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with your pet and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic assets supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this supports\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offers from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word high ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. A. it it makes the well is babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and that's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joints H H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone that's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain\nRelievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's\nWhat ha does that what ha is that doctors call it's the ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nTo his home Oreos up on a thirty foot ladder\nA trimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was nine years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses and of course ah he works about six to eight hours out in the fields every day this was remarkable I almost felt\nHad I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable\nThese people just exhibit a usefulness a a flexibility in their joints certainly a healthful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted them so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung uh ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand and this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself but the ha revolution has come here pat\nAnd of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom the rights to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball with the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one out that it's pretty popular MSN how does this agency stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results do and\nMost of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have lots of benefits glucose main takes quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil and so these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joint and if we can just replace that if we can find a way to get that cushioning back\nThat's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support his lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat\nAnd they haven't heard of ...\nNow the reorder reads on aging sort of tell me the things are phenomenal the product works and study shows how but one of the customers saying what are they telling you candidly what are they saying the bill's already\nIf the horses come back to the trough there must be good water there it's amazing to me how

your liver so needless to say we need all of this energy\nThe key is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and Mac rolling peanuts\nWe're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell that's the person I was just you told you already have to be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two really ... and the reserves for all Snow White supremacist cutting edge combinations purity cause they're so cute super boost formula look at it actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage\nThe cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function is great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and a robot capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting you know we're talking with Dr Alan ... don't you tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decision\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions will be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for the you know I hear him running out of gas I got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is the key nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and pen handy if you're listening we're going to give out a phone number here in just a few minutes\nSo we age uh again we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and pen handy if

decades in your practice but now the story gets better we see an abundance of research emerging unrest spiritual\nHarvard research and was very troll for stamina endurance healthy aging so\nYou tell purity to combine there is very throw blended with the co Q. ten you tell your do you want them to give away a full size bottles for free and they finally agreed to that but how would you just still the benefits if you had to list maybe the top three or four reasons to take this formula what would they be well\nYou know I don't know if I could do three of four mocked but how about ten or twelve

levels in your body\nWould protect cell membranes and ends and Maddox function and that was just an amazing article on co Q. ten ability to decrease the roughness and find wrinkles and your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very troubling for purely products how many glasses of red wine is equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same benefits\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day and that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet yeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could well [laughter] I don't know but I have to drink a glass of red wine a day\nYeah talk to me about how many capsules I've got to take when I Do take them already got a multi um got other vitamins I take I take fish oil\nWhile you just need to take too soft shell a day and that's really easy to take and the best time to take them as right before a meal so you can take you know one before breakfast one before lunch or you could take them together but what do you have to do is take too small soft shells right before a meal\nOr I Know Dr pressing on a pause for a minute remind listeners about this amazing free bottle often it's going on and how can purity afford to
