seconds before we cracked open the microphone\nYahoo has did a story based on the American bar association the story they did they publish it on Tuesday and ignored the fact that the American bar association on friday came out and said look the president of the American bar association who said Thursday evening that they should delay the confirmation proceedings\nFor Kavanaugh that letter\nFrom the chairman of the committee that gets together to essentially go over it and decided that they go through a process themselves of of essentially a vetting and deciding if they're going to support the nominee or not\nBut that process has done behind closed doors and the president did not the president of the VA did not put that in front of them did not send that to the committee so the chairman of that committee on friday wrote a letter\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee and said I'm doesn't speak for the committee\nSo and there's you don't use them in the store and there and

make it public\n... do you end up handing\nIt right or another great opportunity for the Democrats to say you're hiding all from the people whether the normal process is to keep it quiet as we all know out\nAnd I was at the rules are on the three oh too because it because that's an official form and so and and I really don't know if is there any kind of penalty for releasing something any

happens\nI mean it's almost a a a a a guaranteed right just like when somebody asked us back in twenty sixteen oh you're going to be surprised Trump's gonna when I said well actually we won't be

tell you about you know you saw the NPR a poll that showed the it's evening up now right or as to you know for for the house so who knows we'll just we'll Germany thing by you and uh [noise] we'll

produced thunderstorms and tornadoes is the central mid west sections of central Kansas into eastern Iowa far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin we can even include the Detroit area under a\nI think it was big but this is what this is different because of the culture that's being created by the left and the media on the left this is this is different than an objection to high taxes\nAnd and things that are very real here this is a\nA behavior a pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again and I I remember a other\nIntense times that were based on a particular issue of for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan ... uh and you\nHad and and and even before that right or before the election uh you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and right on ... but that wasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there that existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together or not McCain\nFeingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that's when they you know blow the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I read that\nWas on a specific topic yeah I the ... same thing heart bright that's yet how short lived yeah sure sure this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh\n... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't\nAbout this isn't really about Trump and and reading right here it says the rather than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write this the same day that you know the ... the same way that\nYou know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now ah and it says you look at you know talks about the capital is a part of you know a isn't part of the whole\nNow and and as soon as you look at you know talks about the cabinet is part of you know ... isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing or is he suffered from that can believe that and we talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week\nHow boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd and supportive of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other because when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter]\nThe one the one old out except for except for Bill Christ and I\nHaven't seen anything from George and it's like ... yeah exactly so you know is ... ... not part of the ... he he's not some as they ride he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent and the judge is he a pending me of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spend twenty six years in public service and the hope of what what and that's why it's not about him when I think what I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\nFrom\n... from a I think you are the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump and\nDon't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized uh we got to come home for a while because those\nPeople are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what are the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is\nIs gone when an allegation\nItself is enough to destroy someone's life this goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is the it is the culture war but it's also ... and and\nI say a culture where because it's a war on\nIt it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never Trump hers we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never on that never ever got about ... we voted for you and I don't practice political high dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see a ... rallies\nGoing ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why and we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not\nEverything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that what do we know many [laughter] [laughter] I mean we don't really know for as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and ... you know well ah you know I guess she wasn't your first choice if they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me [laughter]\nAnd and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back\nTo many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the left or you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that our number Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this I mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat were you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there are actually\nPeople out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have\nAnd now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a\nOr listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice ... it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and\nI think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa I Know who you know when when um oh ... who was it a try to think of the the the the person\nOh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah ah\nI thought this would because I I I saw that\nA a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media has a lot of people furious excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of\nTo ... he interviewed Shapiro or something like that I saw it on social media and a lotta people furious excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now ... except for Bill Kristol a and\nAnd uh that uh Jonathon ... their ads are usually\nOn Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those\nOtherwise conservatives that when it came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right by the way that was after [noise] the the the house report the house GOP report the eight hundred page report on ... ...\nYes so I I think that's you know what's happening so again uh you look at that and you say wow I live really look for the Republicans then\nI see this Washington Examiner a which is a for anybody to know a very conservative outlet GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending sue nominee\nFive weeks before the critical midterm elections House Republicans are outgunned

the FBI\nOn Capitol is not going to be sent via email\nYou can't take pictures of it um and you can make note if your a senator looking at it but\nYour notes will be secured in the same way that the forms will be and those forms are highly secure so this is how it's going down this is the procedure\nThere's one copy of it\nIt's going that one copy is going to go into a room\nWith the senators the GOP will have an hour with the the Democrats have an hour with it we were told it was being widely reported that they were looking over that a late Wednesday evening I'm the report from the hill a\nEarlier in the day Thursday Afternoon into Thursday evening was that they would review it on Thursday\nOr but the reports came out that they you know it was the senators had\nIt and I assume we're reviewing it and taking that time to review it or at least the G O P might have been a as late as a Wednesday evening so\nThat could pour over into Thursday now there's been some some concern there and of course protest by Dick Durban ride a Democrat to whip a he has been you know of course Bogle through this whole thing but that's who Dick Durbin is\nWell I mean again you look at it and someone making a claim and and the problem is is that the ... claim they can't find anything to back it up the left screens for an FBI investigation well that wasn't going to happen\nBut it's a supplemental background check the president agreed to that you know I was watching ah Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the press conference on Wednesday you know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking\nYou know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question from a female reporter\nWell why is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse and the Catholic Church and\nNo reporter well why is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse than the Catholic Church and those those who were claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend\nAny women I'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers or wait a minute\nHe he's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process\nSo his comments or the rally or were factual base but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claim you know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left at once again has created their own little fantasy\nThat these are credible claims\nBut sorry in this setting they're not if you can't find anyone to back them up eight six six Ninety red eye looking to purchase your own trucker trailer exile financial company may be able to help with financing Eric

the story a just a little while ago and we did that during this past break and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity to review the report\n... over the next couple of bright as we go back and you know because the the cloture vote could happen\nYou know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday a and I suspected that well while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy 'em\nThat he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction\nA you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and they can you know take their time with a um and\nAnd they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that\nEither and one large group or or smaller groups even a in order\nTo to see everything uh we'd seen the story of late yesterday the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling\nOf the Russia probe into the Trump campaign uh and\nThat's a Fox News headline from uh yesterday was going through additional\nMaterials you're in the last hour and saw the he'll dot com and John Solomon who I Believe was with the was the circa ... ... yeah when when they when they released they and they were the ones who desert or ... Carter right need the I Believe it was both of them to do the story on the\nPfizer court's review in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of of of twenty Seventeen\nWell his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation\nBecause I could see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and\nBut but really I mean the approach would likely be\nHere because I could see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable I don't know what the punishment is um but certainly you don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be\nWorking for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate there's a lot of close races and there's no one no talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that\nRule [noise] ah because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward I'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that\nBut you probably could see them and saying look ... and ... it's going to be this it's already this from the liberal media\nOr NBC News on on Wednesday while there are dozens of people thousands of people I think they said over forty people that have said that that that have ah have information\nOr potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use to potentially and their story\nUh that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah ... that's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not\nEnough the the we need a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk\nTo Ford or Kavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ...\nI mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that because the uh Republicans most likely\nWant to abide by the rules that Democrats will do everything they can to claim for example\nIs Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff firms and not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bombshell\nA out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house ah ah I don't know which paddling was but uh in in touch closed door testimony yesterday telling\nThem hate talk to the Democrat\nThe Democratic national committee's lawyers\nRight before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official a at that time which without question shows the politics played a part any talk to them about\n[noise] what was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right ... ... you cannot\nNobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you when I ask questions over a year and a\nHalf ago is this where this is going and we ... you know the thing is every question that we asked about where this where what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true and it has all\nCome out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right\nUm that I well first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there\nAre we looking at possibly grows abuse of power under the previous administration\nThat that a person or persons knowingly used false information to which is the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for\nThat Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour my point that Adam Schiff has do Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time\nThat there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats at the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it and they know the Republicans Romer Lisa because Republicans you know a in a in the ...\nIn this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release or do they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans you know a in a in the in the Senate want to keep a this ruling affect that hey we can't be black but not every background check we knew of every ...\n... of every judge we're not going to do that and so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage\nAnd may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...\nI really think that you may see that let's head right do you we go to mark is in Virginia Marcus welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show Hi [noise]\nHow you doing [laughter] hey I just what you say an Adam Schiff should be investigated I think he's been leak in the old time you may you know [noise] that I Know he has I mean well I don't know it has but right we all believe as\nI mean I was I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life\nAnd even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother in law everybody\nThey're they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democratic party yeah yeah I can I don't think it's going to last I mean they they of overplay their hand well they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind markers and and and thank you for the call we appreciate is a\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids in college and a fake socialism should greatest thing in the world\nGo sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has\nTo follow look uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is or what the causes the\nParty the protestors the far left now leads the party they leave the media are they're very active in the media\nLike they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former CNN officials or or management uh including Ted Turner are saying they become a CNN's become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying\nWho used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's the these\nThe people at CNN believe they are part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change it's not going to end they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell you is we didn't do enough what they'll tell you as we didn't wrap it up enough and even if he's confirmed this weekend and\nWe move on from this don't believe that they're empowered because they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate\nTrump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to\nBe around it but on the the other side they're going to know a that they're in they're in trouble because ... because at the Supreme Court at this point than you have\nA a five four maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist or\nConstruction is doors they call it conservative which would I think is a miss labeling of it but they will ah ah you know it's going to it they know that\nIf Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up on the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there it's going to be pure insanity\nFrom now till twenty twenty because they know that if there's ... between now in twenty twenty if there's a Supreme Court a seat that opens I we've seen how insane it's been now\n... where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right how do you live in\nThis is where they are right now so how far would they go who knows but they don't ... I Can't I don't think they can imagine Trump being president till twenty twenty four because then there's a possibility of two more Supreme Court seats that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win\nOr will they just up the insanity for the next two years\nThe uh the Trojan Horse or a tactic oh we'll just moved to the middle a little bit in order to gain power right what does what they used to do that\nA a a tactic oh we'll just moved to the middle a little bit in order to gain power right which is what they used to do that's what I said they pretend to move yeah middle ... eight six six Ninety right I I\nThe sink Christopher ... cats scale and ... products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways ...\nProfessional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month job opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hub right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nFind truckers connection and job opportunities free at ... traveled centers of America we'll goes and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just ...\nWBRC am WBRC F.

and then not much happened afterwards\nUh but that's where I really first you know got to know John Solomon and some of his work he's been around you see them now on on different you know a panelists and uh on on different shows out there but he works for the hell dot com this from the hill congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith Democratic Party lawyers to talk about Donald Trump and the Russian collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign ... a former FBI general counsel James Baker met\nThey must believe that the inspector general\nCan find the corruption in the department of justice concerning the procedure over the Pfizer warns [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah that's if you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that have listening for a while to the show understand where we are going well it it it ultimately when you when you look\nAt that especially with the idea being given all this ah on redacted information from the White House\nYou you know that there's only one reason the inspector general\nExists that's\nTo look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds Staley in the department of justice accounting irregularities like there's like a pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump polluted with Russians to act the election mhm that was the initial charge or what\nHave we all find out and we all know now nobody's debating it is it was the\nDemocratic National committee and the Hillary campaign the paid a law firm ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS\nWho paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin on verified that they then took to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign and when that\nDidn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that on verified information that they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and what we're being told now\nIs that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\nAnd a number of details coming about uh you know with the Solomon a report that broke on a Wednesday Wednesday evening\nAnd then of course you'd go back to the fact that a Bruce or or at the time a high ranking a an official at the department of

I think\nEspecially after from Thursday last Thursday on uh the capital here a couple of things I Want to briefly touched on coming up on the bottom of the hour Saudi Arabia has increase or crude production why ... ... is from Bloomberg\nTrump ... yeah St you better do it you want military stuff you'd better do it that were on the way for on attracts here's your forecast\nAn unusually persistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies\nAh procedurally basically the petition\nTo invoke a foreclosure a that has happened that happened Wednesday late Wednesday by Senate majority leader a they basically Thursday is a just a kind of a blank day although it will be about reviewing the documents\nAnd friday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote the enclosure for those that may not know is basically just ending the debate and discussion on it\nAnd and saying okay now it's ready for a vote so that vote would happen I'm assuming if I don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them you know ... what the headcount is for the vote and\nI I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote if they get fifty or more\nWe go to Chris in battle creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nThey are good [noise] ah\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that\nThe whole reason they held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearing by a claiming that he was kinda partisan and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing this laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward [noise] they're going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself\nOr abstained from any boats they haven't\nAnybody with anything they want to but they they don't and they can do\nHe's ... now it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't screen that\nWell they every day Graham it'll ruin your cell screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere with Hank anywhere with it okay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and no show that judges should recused themselves Oh yes for an hour well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we've even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I\nCan't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were saved on the ... got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because\nIf if they were or there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company that high rise for the economy at that point to have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we've we've heard\nNow with the company and their wife works for the company ... high and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold anyone\nWho you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister you know and it was like okay let's see if she would have to recuse herself from every case of [laughter]\nWell that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and\nThat and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that uh well\nShe's part of his family but the the the process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there is a great deal of respect by\nEveryone that she does on the court right now for the process not that they make a decision that we should always agree with in fact the uh well I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure on procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case uh\nIt is not it is not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of them\nAnd questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with ... often out of context uh they did that with Scalia um but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd ... but I I think you make a great\nPoint by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that is not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know that a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great I'm One needs to make that their their their family their families\nUsed to vacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have\nAnd said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution that there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to\nAsk the judges privately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say is absolutely horrendous and should not be that way\nBecause ... door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three of his secret is likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if there's a if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the ... came out\nWhat they would do is look at that and go okay was there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThan they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well they know the Senate knew back then\n... that you take something like that a simple plain that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out\nThere that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the\nProcess that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody and never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ...\nThe public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the set of complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow\nA five to four majority\nThat is a more construction as well as journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never it would if you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... ... would not have been able to been cooperate and then at that\nPoint it dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation yes and you know that have\nCome out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades\nAnd that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why Feinstein for her political you why work to her in\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak it to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because of that work in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight

Democrat\nMhm he may have his opinions of what he wants day to day on do you know what we should do with immigration or or how far a welfare should go or what catches\nShould be but on the constitution there used to be agreement\nBetween liberals and conservatives on how they view the constitution that's one big difference that we have today and that's why you have somebody like

for six weeks founder lawyer\nMidwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed an orchestrated the rollout of her accusations Mr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive in

sometimes for us to be puzzled that more than ... percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase that they're ... methods Republicans have figured out that if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man as distinguished

John Solomon\nOr has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official Matt\n... with the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out\nA former FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney ... the Democratic National Committee is private\nLaw firms just we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... used you know they accused of the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election okay remember that was the original\nOf a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign\nGave money to their law for ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy Christopher Steele who then got information he claims\nFrom people Russians very close to the Kremlin which was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh\nDestroy the reputation of Donald Trump during the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met with the law firm Perkins too we ... that really when you look at it\nThey're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign when we got to the law firm they were the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and

I mean it was a great neighborhood and I remember being a little kid and some of the kids are played with started going to school I thought man I Want to go to school he'll be cool to go to school\nWhen I can go to school [noise] I'll be happy than ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it I'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy\nThen\nIn a grade with a number on it I'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when I back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school\n... and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right and so you're like man I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be I'd be ruined the school man\nI'll be happy then\nThen you finally get the sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was seven eight nine ... the school I went to and I thought man if I could just get out of the sixth grade and go over there in middle school\n\nThank you for joining us America we're glad your hair but NASA and Miami, Florida five an hour you\nHave the one that fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up until a few years ago a resigned our children are from Florida prepaid college\nPlan and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and since then\nOur income has gone down and we added another child and we've gotten into San credit card debt and we have a car loan now um\nWe can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we just half our debts and leave that money and continue contributing to their\nPre paid plan how much is in there [noise]\nUm about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars or how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards uh five thousand\nAnd uh and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe just started at ... and that's and I realized we did that baby steps out of order with having the pizza pan pre played pan and then I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay I'm\nIn your household income is one [noise] um I had the next forty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand over to our um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um\nAnd um\nYou do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial position where the and just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nOr no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in\nPrice and so\nIf I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars in increases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be nice rate of return right\nSo how much the increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation rate so that means you're making about some bowing to present on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time mind and so uh you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college\nThe other problem with prepaid college is a is and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness\nGovernment are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my stayed happens to be well run if I were in the state of Tennessee\nProcess I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I don't want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition so all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget crank your lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call the vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things\nAnd that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes\nMatthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you first off for a a ... I was going through a few for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing it's fixing the happened\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil but not not at ... ... ah speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell ... and cash out or\nHopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's the only reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom baby here I mean but ah you know and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in\nA [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would because you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them\nYou have to sell although it all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or what the it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all the and the or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you're just and on ...\n... yeah and my biggest concern is the wrist yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling house\nWe're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business\nAs if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights with it\nMy answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that okay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it than I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate\nAnd it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the middle kitchen table when I go go by our rights in West Texas where this is the answer is no then it's time to sell the same reason I and then you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with as getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash\nYeah well it might but I can tell you start getting less rock markets less risk than growing holes\nWe hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be an old person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father and make a decision\nOh I see so is it just ... they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five percent of it\nYou're not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they're all business and they're scared to death of ...\nYou know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not some advisors to the families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nWe taught them and all that [noise] um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me as a financial coach as I Do that I Would say no [noise] so\nThat money off the tides\nThanks for calling in to the news to have a blessing like this oh\nThis is the ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent out we've got a\nUh like house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there\nIn the ... or weeks that we don't use it and um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth\nAnd so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with them you know going on in the you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to be on a condo over knocks when when the ball game over there\nAnd he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie
