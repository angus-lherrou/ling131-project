eight days away and just looking at the some of the polling are out there by the way to the best call I got was this past weekend we're independent Bob called me and said I'll come Valdez or the Democrat candidate running against governor Abbott here in Texas I haven't seen any commercials\nAre at a plane to him that you don't run many commercials you're not going to going to get major backing for many major political party\nWhen you're down by twenty points so it's it becomes really hard to raise money when no one's backing you I I did read that Republicans think they may have a shot New Jersey and in\nA with a with a a Bob Hugin against or Rob yeah and as I don't know about the ah last when shows uh this is ten sixteen minutes is up by five margin of her four point or ... excuse me Bob Menendez a by five ... five point one Menendez all over the fifty percent\nSixteen minutes is up by five margin of her four point or ... excuse me Bob Menendez a by five ... five point one Menendez all over the fifty percent mark which is usually a great indicator that you're going to win but uh they claim they believe that they have a chance so\nI don't know yeah I I don't know why they think that I'd like to see why\n... and ... and unless you could say you've seen the polls closed he\nHas been in his was up by nine the middle of a you know just a two weeks ago and and\nA couple of days later okay he was only up by five okay there was just a day difference so I'm really not a lot you're talking about a couple of days difference there was momentum there hasn't been a poll since the sixteenth so I don't know if they see something that and they were in journals writing their internal so we haven't seen yet yeah I'd love to know what they're seeing them\nUm that that would be very interesting that would be very interesting uh some very close races though right now in the Senate\nI I think you know you you look at those and and you would get down to election day is going to be really tied on about for at least three or four of those races for video road look here's your forecast\n... if you missed a chance this weekend to being a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed\nThe peak season for many locations around the country the upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota most of Pennsylvania New York in the New England states are past week\nThis week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois and portions of central Iowa and\nWe can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true that nobody deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing the ... believed if things are hyper ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ... and the way you talk to them which\nIs the way he talks about it not want to see not what he wants to do nothing subtle people are against what he wants to do that where you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is the the seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you and I have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends\nWe're all brothers we're all brothers\nWhat I'm saying is that it seems to me that Trump and the way he characterizes people who are\nIn need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me the\nLanguage and have okay but a lot is not the last ... you're not there after that we're just as guilty okay well let me we airs Jerry Lee are using language to characterize ride right well here's not here to energy it's here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion on those are okay are you able are dying but as a result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOr not here's the saints here's the point that I Want to get too because you this is very important 'cause one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that the the\nYanks when we're we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate I Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter]\nYou know the example of been a gym [laughter] had keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's\nOne heck of an allegation\nSo we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance [noise]\nIs it only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it or not what you say [noise] and you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America [noise] buy a lot of people including Trump when you see [noise] the Democrats wish to protect\nIllegal immigrant criminals this is not [noise] Oprah partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today stayed in reality\nNot [noise] Oprah parties in to get people angry it is\nThe reality of what exists today ... dating reality is not hate talk\n[noise] but when you have the Democrats who ... for ... their preference\nIs the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens\nYeah you're going to get people angry including the president\n... what's gonna happen\nUm look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and and\nYou know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was that he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across the border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact he clarified that right after it happened ... but again\nIt was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it now that all are rapists ...\nNow you said all he said rape as\nWell and he didn't say they were all rape is William across it and and ... changed\nMaking the point the very simple point that we have to vent every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making yes [noise] because those the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear [noise] [noise]\nVery simple or something I'd like to go point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are\nBecause you have to understand word liberalism ... uh you know again and you can tell at least he conceded he was conceding some points a by the way I did see over the weekend Bridgette or third political party everything here proves that would stand for what\n... ... ... what are you going to both of them are going to vote for the third political party stand for well where's the center where's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now [noise] I don't know what a moderate is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years\nEspecially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative as a\nThink we all know other liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism but storage [noise] pretty much on the foreign left and then goes to the extreme far left [noise] well tell me what a moderate is [noise] forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is one of the stand for\nWhat are they promote and how they vote [noise]\nAnd I've talked about how a a ... ... talk to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor\nAnd he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion\nAnd even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said 'cause look my dad loved Trump Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but not a racist these dot ... come up\nIs a New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus as you said because we're not liberal anymore now he would be in his fifties\n... so he might still be some of the old school liberals that exist out there versus the new school liberals that are really have the mindset

Republican uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it wins by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question well\nYou know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in and the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that uh but we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the Damon oh I yeah I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was\nWas speaker of the house and and you know\nA ... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated grooves but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the RMC at the convention in the summer of twenty sixteen yeah baby that states but now he's beautiful dead yes right well because now he's useful\nBut if you decided to challenge the president appointed managing and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was better for him was that it actually was able to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement [noise]\nAnd now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me [noise]\nEven though the president is with him in Houston I'm not I mean I I think he would probably again with some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other\nAnd it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote\nFor Senate mhm yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's that's all great wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the in fact been more vocal about uh\nOf course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with\nHer actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department under her leadership\nSo you look at that and the end and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what word comes together\nI guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting\nQuestion and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre prep inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road\nPost trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during your next pre or post trip inspection checked to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and\nFree of any excessive were the trainer king pin must be latch properly\nThe strip inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excess of where the trainer king pin must be latched properly and the jaws of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly\nPh truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post tripping inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert\nTechnicians this maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up a whole eight hundred nine two four shot\n[noise] boy buck for red eye radio with a record ...

Bush and John McCain while they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's\nThe that's the moment the left they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent was there at the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you\nRight now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said I'm finally off the plantation\nAnd when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that what it was was I I'm I'm Out of the ... out of the mindset of groupthink that if I'm if I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin\nThen my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I've been trying to some of the other for your your your\nAccording to figure out they have a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what Glenn fish are you are on right now that we're not allowed you to think as\nYou really think because when when you talk to black folks about the the homosexual thing and the marriage thing or whatever if you talk to the mission by issue as their lives up with\nMore of a conservative mindset but because of their busy so bread brainwashed into your thinking of all races and racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I Wonder 'cause you know we've talked about the identity politics with the with the ... with the Democrats and and the identity politics that have really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and\nThe the country and laws must ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial than if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I started thinking about that and wonder how many 'cause we said this we said with the trans gender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jump to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there saying\nWait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nBecause it's a it's a challenge is so what is the fight banned for ... if we if at all in vain right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender ism there's also trans racial Islam\nAnd they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second because if if you look at a you know the the the civil rights are protected groups created under the civil rights act\nCause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights are protected groups created under the civil rights that\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups then the civil rights and their own is done it's it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there\nOh that entire battle it's we're not\nAnd not only that ... into the uh the civil war was for nothing and wouldn't you fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental systems you know why did we fight you know just to say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now I'm like no we are America's this with America we're not saying that we're\nAs individuals better than anybody or any other country were saying our ideas are better than everybody else in order to other countries\nYes and and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas\nIn in in the constitution where they they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you don't you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are its how horrendous\nRacism and slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and it came to a town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrats that well I\nI Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask them\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion\nAbortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but when you think of what they what the Republicans or Democrats\nUsed to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe a woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man\nOver the black you know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I found incredible as the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\n'cause when I talk to black men about\nOr that situation um they fully understand that the uh 'cause I don't know what you remember it was a little while later it was several years ago she ran away\nAnd uh she blamed it on to black males as so every blackmail that within the city you know came up under scrutiny and that came out that she just wanted to run away you know so\nSo and I'm like now you have to understand that that if you go to that system be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against come true for which\nJames uh thank you so much him saying some reshaped writes thoughts ... than\nThe ... [noise] yeah I mean you're not the first\nPerson who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me from conservative and live my life\nWell you know it's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right and\nOne of the streets of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there is a is six lanes [noise] so there's a lot of traffic has accrued sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here\nUm that is our our our congressmen on the state level [noise] and I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative\nAnd I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nHas anyone ever tried to ...\nAll your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that I Would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media as anyone ever tried to steal your signs\nYou know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street it and so I don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always working in the yard\nI you know I I think the\nOf a\nGroup that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit mhm and the responses that you got in the media coverage of it and James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there was a monumental change in in\nA black ... going to vote Republican but there are much higher\nProfile now and getting much more coverage the left\nHand not permit that they must demonize every single person who would tend to do that because you're talking about a solid demographic base that they have held for a long time a long time you have a long long time eight six six Ninety red eye\n... radio toll free at eight six six he wrote a [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell really tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shell row tell us what matters is inside", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Torrington", "day": "29"}
