I'm doing very very good and we've got a very fuzzy show for this Friday we do extremely busy or latest on the suspicious packages of questions still out there where they live bombs or not\nIt's really amazing going through the different news stories yesterday right from you know you can go to one news story and it will say uh you know lie bomb to go to another one say a suspicious package or go to another one that says [noise] potentially explosive uh uh uh packages\nYou'll get the you know the tweet from the FBI that were you know treating\nGo to another one that says [noise] potentially explosive or a package as you'll get the you know the tweet from the FBI that were you know treating these as potential you know potentially explosive devices and dangerous devices are Cheryl ackison formally uh you know CBS News\nShe's been following it and her latest one is look nobody has said these were actually lied bombs that could have gone off\nA officially earlier she had a a written this goes back about seven hours ago she had written a the fact that you know law enforcement has not said that any of them are and then she uh uh clarified it a couple of hours ago and said now they're you know they're still calling them suspicious packages and write potentially suspicious packages\nAnd I think it's important and I you know you just you just wonder I mean now we and we'll get into this year and a little bit\nNow you know we know the trail they're down in Florida but I think the other place you know looking at a New Jersey whatever and you're getting all these leaks right but nobody has leaked\nReally one of the most important things which would would ... would give ah you you would think the media would want the opportunity to go down different paths right right and so my first question would be where they live bombs are not ... but they were potentially explosive devices that doesn't tell me anything\nWell and and what I don't see here is this a is is this an over abundance of of of caution in a warning when we go back to a several months to the Austin bombings you saw ... of the authorities in that area\nYou know because they didn't know what they were dealing with right they were talking about how people in the Austin area shouldn't approach a any kind of package on their porch or even their own porch [noise]\nEspecially something they didn't\nOrder or anything else they had to be very careful about now there have been some you know a alerts out there but for something like what's going on right now if we were looking I think if you're looking at life bombs especially the fact that right now you've got them all over\nYou know it's not just in one location it's not just Enron area they're all over\nOr a no\nNo but game I asked Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood\nThan what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I I don't know I my two my two conspiracy theories and the ones you know initially they weren't going to initially they weren't going to fire\nThat wasn't in their plans or at least initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning you figured out they'd suspended until after Halloween ... come back after Halloween but but then they went\nOh wait a minute hold it she's not producing some weight a metal rating we can get out of this contract we can we wow one of the lawyers said you know this could be causing if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off her contract that's one side of it the other side of it is\nMy of the conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I don't want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justify all the fire me for cause [laughter]\nWell but I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference Megan Kelly's saying\nThat on her old show on Fox News would've just been another night of making ...\nYou wouldn't have heard complaints [noise]\nMaybe I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same I mean she may have had to follow up and say\nYou know hey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference and and and the type of a audience that you have\nThere are so who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was

[laughter] well you you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the\nTweet was a Donald Trump junior the put it out earlier again Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media uh\nYesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well saying well where was the call for civility when a someone sent fake rice in to his residence and\nAnd it was you know that got ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother\nHe was asking uh I forget who was he was asking uh in in that tweet ah he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened\nI mean you see a number of things have happened or that\nAnd with any president or presidential family but especially this one you've had how much you know that has happened and been said um and we have to point out because Gary laid it out a and thank you my for the call a this was several months ago [noise]\nBut you're talking about when you call someone\nA Hitler what the threat is [noise]\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the worst mass\nMurderers and history pure evil you are saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable\nThe threat to someone is\nThat guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes the threat\nThat that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat\nThat Hitler was and that's the ultimate threats so the calls for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president\nYou got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer ... one of the most evil people ever exist on earth [noise] that's\nVery different [noise] uh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist\nAnd the or Terry in mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we've said nothing to indicate set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything has it in in my opinion well let me All right let me say that\nNinety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument\nThat that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted or his rhetoric may offend you\nOr his provocative nature may offend you but what does he actually does\nDoes he deserved is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world is that\nEven close to any type of accurate portrayal no it's just pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do it is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt\nTo have a discussion on the policies of the president [noise] well let's look at this and is that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy who\nAre committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps that what Donald Trump is he's a fascist\nLet's throw Mussolini in there to ... you know ...\nLet's combine Hitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst\nBrutal evil people that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump well of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say and\nThe other point that we made over the last couple of days is after\nThe Steve Scully shooting\nUp going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a\nA you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate\nMembers of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now mhm ah they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve ... represented ...\nSeriously injured did that change the rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they amp it up to the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh under insanity\nOver the last couple of months the reality is it's not going to stop\n... why we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go\nTo the limit of ... of of of free speech they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens in our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that what will temper that\nIs if they continue to lose\nElections Americans must reject\n\nReject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so you know we we have talked about you know also the morality of the media\nAnd and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason mhm the Russian collusion almost two years of it never ending hounding by the media\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been the the law is against this president coming from the media had been ...\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been the the lives against this president coming from the media\nHad been never ending [noise] right [noise] the similar stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this what our sources told us well if you can't if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well\nIt you know you have a the remember the indictments came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort\nAnd the president tweeted a that day you know no collusion [noise] and then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proving collusion something to that effect\nNope nope you\nKnow and that's false that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that\nKind of BS out [noise]\nMuch less a major newspaper because there was no proof none still is done\nTo this day nothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows but more has in front of them know that may change [noise] ... what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative will\nThink about this was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for ...\nBecause of Russian collusion right and trees though the president now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last two years so let's move on to something something else and then they they\nAttempt to walk away as if well no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nWhen we were just really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh he got there illegally ... he came to power illegally and with the help of another major nation\nThat is the ah that that in terms of new is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat [noise]\nAnd ah he is he works for the Russians he's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing as Hitler was\nRemember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year and that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen\nYeah and we have a a an election coming up in what eleven days yeah [noise] and ah and where are they screaming about that it's gone silent now why is

Fifteen ... remember the number of people that called us some were furious at us because we were a mock and it was ridiculous you know the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and\nIt's these a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and Walmart and everything else and people are jumping aboard this crap\nMhm and it's pure crap and you buy into it separate yourself from those idiots over their deal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the truth not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world because everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter]\nWell I mean we're we're just going to start investing I'm never forget the I'll never forget that moment in a jade helm ... Fifteen when you know it was the\nNight we were getting barrage with phone calls you guys just don't understand you know understand what we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh you know something that you don't know there are more I feel special mhm because somebody else has told me in and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce at one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county frightened by\nSomebody that was going to be spent on your nose was going to be may be spent that's how sink rented was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they've spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we've we've dealt with it we we've dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to we actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics\nAnd these are people that listen to our show yes [noise] so for us it's a constant fight and\nYou know with the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were\nBuying into I remember we had to re portions of Popular Mechanics ... number of Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for these things these theories about mechanics in physics are being put out there that's what we do [noise] let's see whether they're actually possible or not\nUh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the ... brothers\nOh man so we go on we've been getting a information coming in about what was going on in Watertown uh\nUh about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven thirty central that night and we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports because there there was breaking news and we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show or\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this the Boston bombing the other bothering bombing suspects and when they essentially went through Watertown\nAnd and uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the the the ... about I don't know half way through the show when we looked at\nIt was captured the later but when you look at the\nThe the ... about I don't know half way through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about well if it then they gave us Pacific names these are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are you saying this asking us\nAnd they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names right\nAnd look we're not going to be [noise] I don't have any\nA desire to go out and be first I only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news\nWe don't I Do I Do not\nWant to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\nI don't\nBecause here's what's different about specific names if we if the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we recover and we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town when it is a specific name\nIf those names belong to people who are innocent Brian\nRoss or anyone else that might be\nReporting something then you start saying that because Brian Ross that ABC after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well\nHow do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time I\nBelieve the goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting the name out in fact you and I wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who\nThey were chased him and that at least the sunny and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify many legit source and we believe that we don't have confidence in that it is that that is true and and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right and so\nAgain we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people see that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I looked at this week that's what we've been focusing on\nIs for the Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth\nBut so you can you can passionately attack the other side don't play their game\n...

[noise]\n\nA threat I radio he's our company and I'm Mary McNamara trees is a story was made\nNational news yesterday and and I was checking in over a little bit this was Steve Bannon's get together in upstate New York I Know exactly where he spoke yesterday had been by that ... ...\nRoad volunteer fire company ... New York ... is two hundred people showed up invited you know a Republican candidates from the urge to show up nobody showed up though\nSo it was going to be like maybe some kind of informal ... whole discussion or something or died\nOr were they going to really going to talk fire prevention I mean what's the what's the point of them showing up I uh I I really don't know but uh I just\nI mean\nWhat's the what's the point of them showing up I uh I I really don't know but ah I just you know\nI don't know what to draw is for us the ban I mean I Know there is because I used used perceived as the guy who\nWho got the momentum going for Trump ...\nYeah but didn't the ... the charisma though and I understand what she did you know for the campaign but really that charisma was carried by by Trump oh I'm so I I Know I so I don't know if of course I mean ... after you know after you're done as an advisor ... not really a lot of people\nCare that's my whole point\nI don't know what the draw would be for ... for him there really wasn't a dry your two hundred and ... yeah that's what I mean you agree but you know the children now look at all of the probably not but up until now look at all the attention for Steve Bannon right once he was gone for the White House I was like\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a\nRepublican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way it's never been the most accurate way we believe\nTo truly a show the indication of economic growth because money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts the actual growth rate\nOf any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the truth expansion\nOf well yes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nA you would have had\nA a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent off from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why\nBecause of fossil fuels which drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending right\nSince April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nRoughly year and a half when that government spending goes away\nSo does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us on the increase of\nIncreasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are as a matter of whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative\nOr liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in goods in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we talked about the president\nAnd the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states\nIn Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas\nWhich was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask\nDo you have any idea what you're talking about well and as we a break\nAll over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAnd as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then his actually spent and and\nAnd and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth a leading the way into twenty to twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the gross is in the private sector or\nWhere the lack of growth is in the ... in the end of that you do yes you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for a quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not what it is that why you do it and but also that is\nThe majority of that money mhm of increase of that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now\nBut down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt ... one works against\nThe other one the other thing is the multiplier effect is not the same as in the private sector because a multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something that makes somebody else else's life more efficient or makes their business more efficient they use that and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increase in productivity\nAlong that private sector in line that really boost who really is the true economic engine\nThat that shows that you are having economic growth thinking uh see our society I think of the smartphone\nYes you know like it is so that that is that that great demand a because it's a ... because it's ... creates that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity\nAnd that's where you see again that multiplier a to create that huge expansion and well and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nWill defense spending you will build the initial product but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business\n... ... what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something\nYou're using debt down the road it's where it gets in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector and to improve the efficiency and\nProductivity above their businesses down the line it stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire\nEconomy yes and that I made a difference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism and general yeah and you roll right but it but that does not have the same and media the fact that the private sector multiples are due\nAnd that's and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of home building now when the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... until the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase\nYou you talk about the two biggest drivers of of when you talk about what ... the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars are both have been targeted by terrorists\nWe haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road for and the big terrorists haven't even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned\nWith the direction of this White House when it comes to\nEconomics and I have no idea where has has the ... Congress talked about and ... ... about what they're going to do with the new NAFTA there's been I don't know I ... zero talk on\nWhat happens if you because they want to get this done [noise]\n... [noise] and what happens when the house if the house she goes to the Democrats [noise]\nYou know can they get this thing done by the end of December ... and they get this through\nThe end it because we're talking about what to the public and how they feel about it right we're not we're not really sure young even forget about what we talk about the the house turning blue\nWe have to talk about ... the the Republicans right now and given or a assuming that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year\nAnd so you have to ask what are the plans because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right\n[noise]\nAnd serials was in ... you're you're\nSo the plants because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right [noise]\n\nAnd you're ... you're you're seeing some of the earnings reports coming out from major companies um a number of them are the that was a certain ... or or that came out\nAnd you have poured you had a with their with their foreign sales as a result of brutality retaliatory tariffs a caterpillar and others that are talking about business losses as a result of the terrorist situation\nBut material costs I mean what about all the smaller companies and if we talk about the contractors you know Lockheed Martin is a given right but there are many smaller companies that are included in that tire process hundreds of men hundreds company and the same with manufacturing\nRight on the on the private sector side with terrorists the material costs we started hearing from a you know the makers of appliances washers and dryers and everything else\nAre you and I both about the same time\nWent through uh the uh water heater a purchase\nA few weeks apart from each other and we were both told by you know the parts that did the job the costs are about to go up I Know for a fact I got I have a family member who's in the commercial H. back business and their costs are going up the businesses is still doing strong\nBut that cost cannot be denied and the question is what impact overall does it have on the economy eight six six Ninety road I", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "26"}
