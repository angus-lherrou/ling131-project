um\n[noise] there's a big problem we have to be so careful of what we say you should hear the CBC which is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for Canada [noise]\nThey report the news coast to coast and they are all the people of the last say the Trump bashing every single day every chance they get\nThey just I don't know what is going on and\nWith people my daughter just graduated a couple of years ago from death journalism school again Canada and she had to be so careful when she was going through the course\nOr to lean bit lean on the left right because here you can't get a job in

you had a good prime minister before that oh I had I Believe\nIs wonderful uh and we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd they soon as they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from was um\nOh what do you call that acting um sac\nCity island where they went to school for acting thing still doing it during his\nActing and thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing evaluate\nThe official prime minister Ali boy it makes you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the lady will ridges mail anymore daughters sisters a son it it just doesn't seem to matter how ...\nHow do we ever win elections well I guess we're just finding the people that the won't talk to us and the friend is so we don't get you know the people that are so I wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you\nBut I'll tell you this ... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh\nThe security when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or they when they found out what my news were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I\nAm a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservative talk show host or some liberals are most of them are not\nA ... you know what shepherd I'd be in one what kind of America to we have in twenty eight tea and when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for video road lot\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook it'll be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow according to the national\nWeather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter now NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that period of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nOr the left us already crazy and and so far out there let's see uh butch in Denver you're on with mark\nMark how you doing well good good I I just wanted to follow up with something you mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it as having\nAll the relationships friends family colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit for his ... five years ago because I just couldn't take reading\nSome of the things people were writing\nAnd you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was the president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationship you know\nWatch started to go in your direction first of all I I gotta say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously\nAnd was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right or if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me\nOr you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned like you kind of indicated\nI've learned not to say much about politics or the ... when they know all the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know try to\nSay all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad and I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nThat that does some good but the uh like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore\nIf I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook so I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information\nSo I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nA little mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I ah I I Do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything there is a bright spot or let the Canadians weren't aware that\nThe U.S electorate we're going to do what's best to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us and that worked out in the end show all that horrific stuff that came off of a uh\nTrying to and us and that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off\nOf a of\nPaul Kennedy and I'm a at a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green\nOr all of that probably helped a jet of Obama\nOr get a Trump elected\nBecause it was trying to hurt for when we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we'd already been told a for\nYour Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and yoga racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate and he went\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse or we were very very disappointed or you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] [noise]\nWell I think if they voted for him because uh they want the show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is that he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out I uh not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rat Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know and they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that for the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him probably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar I've got to admit that\nAh people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark a I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make um first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who said was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem the Windsor liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise in the power of the individual\nNot the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over\nUs as individuals but they are fighting\nFor their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nYou said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights and they're so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example with anti\nFascist themselves and they it when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think uh they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said\nWe want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so I I don't think that's who they are low they pretend right to protect the little guy and they they care about my minorities and they\nCared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left where the ... Democrats that you\nCould count on to be moderate the scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nAnd the Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he's six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ... on red eye radio\nBen let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine of seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark I serve on red eye radio\nWith ... radio toll free at eight six six zero [noise]\n\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy a freight line or trucks\nHave fun but be safe on all your summer adventures this year topped test that has a great line of silver battery packs\nJumps daughters and emergency lights to keep you prepared for that dead battery in your phone or in your car to fool line of tough tested emergency ready products at the all new truck tested\nDot com website tough tested products available at O'Reilly's auto parts loves wrote ranger sat brothers pilot flying J he ate Petro select staples and Sam's Club location and more non all products available at all locations\nVery truckers quick question for you how do you say entertained when you're not on the road some drivers watch DVDs on lab job so there's just reading a book on their ... some people even resorted truck stop TV or spotty wife by no thank you me I like to unwind at the end of the day with live HDTV in my cab\n... portable satellite antennas it's easier than ever known him to your roof are still until your day is over then just shut them up and your sleep or gas ban tenders or lightweight shut up and minutes and don't require allies like in\nA shit load it gets even better with this there's no long term TV contract this page or go programming you pay for only the most you actually use check it out at this from my truck\nDuck had fleet or they're just want to give your truckers the comfort\nOf home on the road is due to safety GV is perfect\nFor leads to all the TV you love to watch it at home in the comfort of your cab\nAnd you have to put up with trucks Doug TV ever again find out more desperate much truck dart gun today restrictions apply\nTo available at Rhodes ... dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue to listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected that's or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker I'd gone for any story and voila you just start listening road gene dot com\nOr many have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation ... looking for news and entertainment website like Netflix you can watch brand new original trucking shows and videos me just for us truckers and you wouldn't find it anywhere else\nThe transportation mission dot com trucking shows and videos on demand so you can watch whenever you want to do starting up and start watching what three that perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now\nI don't leave the RC am WBRC F.
