forecasters saying anywhere between a three and six PM come ashore there\nEvidence is how you judge somebody's guilt right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look for the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race\nOr because of their age you believe people because the evidence backs\nWhat they what they say now you can believe them you can sit there and why I think that sounded credible\nIt doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called them a rapist because that's what they were doing they were calling him\nArenas and the gang rape is yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes they believe cabin on did it the evidence isn't there never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them because you say no I Believe in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption of of uh of\nOf innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change\nI'm suspicious those are all rational critical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability\nTo harass you everywhere even invade your privacy weren't ever you are\nAnd it's not just the ah the old guard and Maxine Waters\nOr he'll know Clinton is Cory Booker people that are called the future of the party\nIt's ... it's now Hillary yes well and and you know that you can easily just minutes of Maxine Waters in the Hillary as the old guard but the future of the party is this so if if Hillary jumping out well by the way Hillary's jumping on board as you mentioned because everybody else's because she sees this\nAs the future of the part and and she and she also believes it's the mainstream of yeah already ... saying it's okay to call to for instability because somebody believes and due process a presumption of innocence a preponderance of evidence to decide somebody whether you believe somebody is guilty or not you went from\nWeeks ago people talking about John McCain and we need more severe multi to the official call for instability\nIn just a matter of weeks I you believe in due process under the constitution you believe in uh the presumption of innocence you don't believe somebody just because they say at the the evidence as to prove it in their story should remain consistent you believe those kinds of things which are embedded in the constitution of\nThe United states than you are a rape\nEnable list yes a rapist enable is that what you are right and because you are no stability towards you that is their opinion\nRight now I have to ask you is that insane or what well before

latest on hurricane Michael which has been\nUpgraded to over night and in fact in the last National Hurricane center advisory about an hour and a half ago hurricane or yeah we'll get another one a little over a Ninety minutes from now and and see where that goes but certainly again I'm not much is changing in terms of\nThe fact that this is a a life threatening storm a a major\nHurricane on its way to Florida so uh will will\nA life threatening storm or a major hurricane on its way to Florida so uh we'll we'll talk to Tom here in just a few minutes and\nFollow the story of course throughout the morning this morning and as well uh the rest of the week as a Michael continues its path or through the south east and then back out over the Atlantic did you see where a ... or send me Senator Tom cotton said that\nHe believes Schumer's people leaked before word letter\n[noise] really yeah he was on with on Hugh Hewitt show yeah instead I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm [noise] well I mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem\nOut of the realm of possibilities because if you were Feinstein you you don't take the chairman Grassley you take a choose sugar party letter right and and have him deal with it right for video robot here's your forecast\nData from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins\nHave increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher gusts possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane Michael extremely dangerous life threatening storm surge\nHurricane force winds and heavy rainfall expected as well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of this system will get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline and\nYou relate to what your cat and what you can uh if somebody has been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be Kate and and and and Kate was quite a devastating storm\nA and at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well ah there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm this storm is an October storm math he was an October\nStorm and there was a a failure but a Celia was a major all these are major storms but Ophelia was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida and so\nRight now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore yeah now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course ah you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in in the destruction of property and and presenting a danger to humans but but really the flooding of the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nI'm being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and\nIs often deadly um and and that is something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember that the ... in in\nAnd but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... and in past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody [laughter] and I have to go out in the lightning and right right [laughter]\nOkay yeah indoors it's lightning right you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving and and we had\nOver thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast\nAnd let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way and and so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh\nUh toward a the coastline just south of Perry and the Big Bend you're looking at a a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mentioned\nThat because you know we've seen in a recent video from the salami and Indonesia we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know uh you're right there I mean there is no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays is right there what is what is the is that how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um all the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is his Israeli and extension the northern extension of the north bay a or the grand lagoon this entire area\nFrom the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach right I'm an inland\nAll of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much and it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you see in the ... like ... turning the water on and watching your bathtub so and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so\nThe bath tub spill and so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it's darn close to it ... North Carolina I picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet\nI'm there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point I'm\nIn the sticks out there if the Carolinas um but this water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet sixteen and so forth you need to be able to get to a place\nThat's higher than the storm surge and that's a really simple as it gets and this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff\nUm and when I say it's moving it it's it's normal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed and so you've got a certain amount of uh\nIt's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's going to slow that body down but it's still moving so I the the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times\nUm because it's just a beautiful ride in your ... your\n... you know if you've done this have driven from East Point Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and they're looking at\nAppalachian ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise] um ... then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise]\nUm well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone\nAnd feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes yeah\nThat's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one ah in in in Texas\nAnd the and the guy was scenario over in summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these builds uh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but add\nAnother three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that\nIs very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroyed yeah\nSure and wildlife yeah great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily on ... and so again or the timeline here we're looking for the eyes to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that it's going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north northeast uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time um but if it picks up some speed\nOr even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth and we could anticipate the same coming in a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now I thought\nThere getting rain right now men so cold has just had a light rain a lot in fact all of this is very light rain in tropical rain starts off his little find drops in than increases from there [noise] um\nThere's a couple of little thunder storms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland and and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for all right forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out and it would take those wins back over to\nProbably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but now remember this this\nRight now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more ... are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles from All right so\nThe support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers how's lubricate or the ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fun cats scale ... and ... products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know in the records America's most red trucking Newsday [noise]\nNow every week and watch me and my co host Jessica Rose as we bring you the only weekly news show created just joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile than trucker dot com is the one from not you're not\nGoing to want to have them be he traveled down the highway so tune in every we watched the trucker nice gentle by going to the record dot com\nOr WBRC am WBRC F.

J. H. G. channel seven down there is going to be going wall to wall coverage [noise]\nUh and uh and\nThey are twenty feet I called and talk to him just a minute ago uh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level now they're\nOptimistic that they won't see a storm surge\nUm that will get up to the station right and they're also optimistic that the generators contend the pound power generator or work in the station as fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon right um\nBut obviously I tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them and a half hours after it has passed by right um but I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline\nThat are there because they realize that even though the majority of people have evacuated out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds get up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins\nUm but that being said even though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be in there in force I Know are surrounding a Panama City\nThey've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida has called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards are guardsmen or guards folks ah [laughter]\nAnd uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um\nDeclared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask you this big because you did or you had predicted\nA before the last ah advisory that showed that went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of them of a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do you see if we can even as it gets closer to shore\nNo I don't see a weakening is gets closer to shore in this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature\nUm the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air there is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near this and so\nUh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the worm sector that's the area ahead of the cold front\n... that warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and and the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr what ever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to degenerate a little bit so talent\nSo it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm eighty two maybe a little more than ...\nMile an hour gusts was sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachia cola and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore\nOr this afternoon and and then they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour as so\nYeah this is this is a fascinating point um you you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen\nUh savannah because of the wind field is going to have wins that are being gusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast\nUm all of that area um potentially as far up as Morehead City um is going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and crosses Georgia cross Valdosta\nAnd probably somewhere between savannah and Augusta a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\n... young we're looking at I'm looking at the map right here and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get it by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I\nDidn't even mentioned Virginia but yeah it goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that the Windsor gonna bring onshore flow\nAnd it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area\nOr are still pretty significant and I'm\nI'm we're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England of one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains\nWhile while uh and and\nThat causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore\nHigh water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave you earlier um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds ...\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road\nWhich is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something even if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it was being as if a a\n... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding\nOn the road back and forth just kinda bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah grade point great point on from there are\nSix its own water six its own level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be\nYou know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it and and so just imagine all those containers of why gallons of water on a giant entire Iowa the grocery store rolling across continuously\nEvery minute across the road what are the odds and it's going to tear up that road and you think you'd just\nBeing tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it it has that forces you raised six inches right\nSo you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assessed possibly assess properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there is absolutely no reason to go through a high water or a a low area that's\nThe ... and again he those warnings are there is absolutely no reason\nTo go through a high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations and heed the warnings of those local and state officials and the that that are there in Florida and those other states that will be dealing with Michael over the next twenty four thirty six forty eight hours\nI hear as we continue our conversation with Tom hill will do that next hour meteorologist Tom hills been on a with us before covering a Hurricane Florence most recently and also Hurricane Irma for us\nAs well you're on red eye radio greatly appreciate your time ... and we're going to talk to you next hour with an update ain't I guess we do we do have it on the national Hurricane Center that will come across here in just a few minutes in about forty five minutes or so Tom will break that a new update down for us and tell people what exactly it means\nThanks so much for ... uh yeah so the latest which is what I Am in and we know was a of a category for ... a a hurricane now and we'll see whether in just a little over twelve minutes we'll get the next report in and we'll have that for you you about eight six six Ninety ...\nSomebody else was guilty ...
