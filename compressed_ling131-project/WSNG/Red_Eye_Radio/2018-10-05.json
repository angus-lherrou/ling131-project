You're welcome to the show I\nThank you um I I was watching the Christian work this afternoon and what other correspondents was talking about ... forward wanting the FBI to have her therapy now from two thousand twelve and\nWanting the FBI to have her therapy notes from two thousand twelve and\nNo no no no she didn't know she did she tell you well she did and I mean that's all that's all she did not want back she was holding back the notes from the ... from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe from her from the Senate yes the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there's a big difference in other words within it it that's it as part of the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWell no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats them and they and they present it and the people get to see it the FBI were what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with him I wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check the impact\nWhat the FBI would do with it would be put it into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI and this entire equation is to give the Senate the information you're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end\nUp in the partisan body anyway that's in fact the only purpose the FBI served in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\n\nIf I mean she would officially be give putting it into the Rio too had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a bind steam of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute and do go that way no so it's useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that would if you ... if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and forged assuming Ford's lawyers were telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after\nBecause the background check the supplemental is over recover electronics here's your forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa has moved north where it will see stretches of by ten\nMainly clear today with the exception of far western Texas there is a moderate to risk of excessive rainfall however from eastern Iowa into far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin\nIndeed if the evidence supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation I don't know what other imprint we shouldn't draw\nFrom your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications\nWith the ah with the Washington Post a Dr Ford\nHas relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light\nOf recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key of look at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs\nParticularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono other than\nA year communications with me and my staff member\nA my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a deadly re mirrors Julie sweat neck or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday\nSo it was like I said in the last caller brought up was she was going to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with data there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee kind of\nEnded up in the report we wouldn't see the the the only senators\nWould set the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to the people who said she wants to people to see it\nSenators was sent the only the centers would see at ... goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to the people who says she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide give it to ...\n... directly outside of the three oh two because then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly or\nLightened legally before [laughter] just release the entire rankled the just the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n'cause they're not political [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] okay but I'm not really a well the Washington Post and the wall Street Journal [noise] no I mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that a woman sets and here in front of you were\nOkay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting a bum please let us know your please give to us you know what you have shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa mhm yeah\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have right now what what is what is that what is that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again [noise]\nWe're getting into areas or you know with the lawyers stayed in they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\n[noise] yeah\nAnd I ate a demand that doesn't even a demand that within a demand that would

the show listening online high\nThanks good afternoon from Indonesia I'm a longtime listener first time caller you know I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican as you pointed out it is just sheer committees job to investigate Kavanaugh\nAnd this whole situation and Dianne Feinstein wrote struck the justice I don't know why everybody is just not totally up in arms about this maybe eventually they will be\nBut to me that the wheel criminal in all of this because if Feinstein released it releases pervasive back in July it\nWould if they quietly handled and investigated thoroughly it would've maintain the anonymity of lives they forward it would have respected Kavanaugh's reputation and they would have gotten to the bottom of this and\nI have a cabin or would have been bounced out of the nation or and believe it was a forward would have been proved to be right or not but I Am Feinstein obstructed justice year and pull this last minute and she should be ... you know read out of town around for obstructing justice I mean it's a criminal act\nWell if you look at it as whom who betrayed the trust\nOf of Dr Ford\nIt was signed Feinstein it was ... it was the end it was the Democrats right down on them if they're the ones that leads into the media if if if we're taking Dr Ford at her word mhm then the only people that have been trained doctor Ford or the Democrats right\nExactly and that's the biggest thing that's being there and it is if what county\nOf the ends justify the means is just over and over getting more and more brutal and I just don't understand

we've talked about before is probably about the seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about him and it was really a somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professional eating and\nAnd uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man\nWho was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of the liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black\nMan said he loved our show right think about that and that was really my first taste of that type of insanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk we do have good to see a a they were stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage right with could not believe that somebody of color would be listening to and more so be a fan\nOf the ... right\nAnd you remember when it happened and I was like I'm sort of like laugh you know it was like well I I Can't do this it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system for me it like right on ... on on a personal Wilson per se right on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're\nWe're we're facing because the rage and bitterness I Believe is probably still there today in this person yeah I mean it's just I I Can't imagine that kind of mindset I have\nFriends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them since grade school and we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else\nWe love each other we tease each other about the politics and there was no way that either of us none of us would ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for\nMany but I'm going to let it wasn't even what I said it was a black man like yeah we talked and of course I was a little bit about about eight six six Ninety run I\nWhen it comes to proper tired

I didn't ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know and you\nKnow that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that\nIt does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying ah you know turning down the Obama endorsed but\nThat it does not hurt his base right\nThey don't care right ah\nWell Obama's yesterday's news well\nI mean I'm lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the hero of the ... the point is is not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that heroes going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim\nOf whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor ... there's the person standing next\nFellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor does the person standing next to you will have a new reason to weigh a victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be\nYou here's an here's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my got that\nLiberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a better work here in the state of Texas I look at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right he really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat\nUp there and he like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God light to pose or\nIn ten years went by the beginning of his his inauguration to the end of his term as president of the United states\nThat is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also need him anymore he's not to think about this now is the Obama is not ... as a president like him because you and I talked about this and that you know by the by the time we got to them in terms that Obama would be the leader we ... on sale predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or ... he's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party is nothing anymore now\nGoing back to the the tragic night here in Dallas\nIn July twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook\nAnd one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course but\nThey were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six\nPM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching the thing I remember the most is them saying\nWhat does Obama done for us to remember this was ... one is sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us\nNothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nCracks in the foundation if you will of the left although we had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling you because you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American or\nWhat does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no genes rational right and it and it always will be that's why the party has no direct I invited\nOut that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goals this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions ... then then the party is led by them they're going to try and that it was every direction and they have no direction at all except for
