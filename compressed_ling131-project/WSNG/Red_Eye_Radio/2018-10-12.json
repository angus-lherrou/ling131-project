Radio Welcome to the show\nUm I I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons like he said uh including perhaps a political agenda\nWith respect to some businesses but the thing about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why NAFTA was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo hair Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do\nIs make a law that everything must be produced here because ... prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies that would make the goods and services that you get\nPrices would be much higher than they should be dude and retail doors shutting raft and right on the opposite for ... you would go in a massive recession\nIf we had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services would sky rocket\nDrew the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology for the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get\nAble and it is changed that and it is an incentive a a again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I\nThe end of a a again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\nThe ... really one of the most underreported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states is now on an happened about three weeks ago\nBecame the number one producer of oil in the world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you know if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did [noise]\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason or communist supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the thing too is that right\nSo the but the buzz you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials\nIs still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly controlled by the government that is something that his policies put in place that doesn't need to be there\nOr what have you know when and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada\nMexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a Jew things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ... candle I had already agreed to that\nGuy or a you know book before so that was a lot of the great victory ... uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA\nAnd then there's not much change from the\nOld NAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed that he claimed was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico\nIn the United states and in Canada ... nobody is debating that that's not what happened and that's viewed as a victory [noise] well if I remember two of the president's major goals\nHis goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit [noise]\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does ... is the exact same as the old NAFTA\n... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm uh and\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the one where the because that the president's trying to make the terrorists were worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get you increase the cost of automobiles\nFor people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction\nIn the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean you if you\nIf you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer\nYou know the farmers I mean if you if you say\nIt's a very populous viewpoint right\nWe need to help the farmer but when you think of the role that they play in and the and the global market in terms of food [noise] uh you know set of before a few minutes ago but [noise]\nThey feed the world [noise] that food goes all over the world um you and and they're telling the administration\nLook your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\n[noise] and and that's [noise] the because\nForget about the political pawns ... president doesn't need them [noise]\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need\nThat [noise] and they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite [noise] right because it is you know it's just a protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers ... it's ... I mean they get their government bailout [noise] with the ten percent mandate [noise] so [noise] I have to believe inside the White House right now there probably\nAre scrambling well in terms of of getting things done and as you said it was ... it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that show\nAnd and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh\n[noise] the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation [noise] well wait a he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat [noise]\nThreatened and ultimately cost ... people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to the grocery Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nOr as I say if it was said you know ... and again in ... we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA [noise] right [noise] well and that's it except for the you know it and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually\nBut the president did allow what what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars overall\nWas that worth the loss of business is with the terrorists that the president has put on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials and\nOther goods and services for American businesses are businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule because now but now he mentioned that\nBut his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get [noise] well we made it so some uh some employers of\nIn Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some [noise] have to do that will be fine you just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker [noise] uh and\nEven with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said Boston I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great so we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and\nWe're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that [noise]\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up as to his caps\nOn what what Mexico you know could send us in cars before other terrorists hit [noise] well we haven't read they haven't reached that cap\nAnd a car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of ...\nThat for both Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only\nDo we now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety

S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon or they do one or two things\nGet rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nOr this news item the cofounder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ... for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite of the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law for her ... who paid an opposition research from a\nFusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got [noise] a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order to change the outcome of the election by getting unverified\nSalacious allegations against Donald Trump that they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign\nWhile the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of the well the cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth [noise]\nReally know the average Virginia Republican subpoena Simpson on September twenty ninth or\nAfter the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign ... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's either ... or they're going to\nAsk are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think I saw the right or are they going to ask him about a of\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league ... if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why brought\nThat up uh uh I don't think so what are they going to ask him a lot of money I was I going to ask him about Kanye West probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role [noise]\nUh in the uh entire floats\nOf the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office\nOf the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the ... and an associate deputy attorney general\n[noise] ah\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there\nBetween Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the ask\nA does see\nOh he would he yes from the department of justice yeah well yeah save because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and\nI and and again if those are ... that that's the number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nAh so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement\nWith a you know a professionally possibly with his wife\nAnd if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do\nAs you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself and we understand ... what I Would wonder is a\nLens Simpsons lawyer ...\nWhat is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word ... that the house Judiciary Committee and the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask his lawyer than\nWhat do you think they're going after right if they're not\nWell look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you that there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong\nAnd I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf a fusion GPS committing any crime [noise]\nI don't know I'm One I don't know where there was any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money ... thrown opposition research firm that are just on the level\nIs is that what you do you get hurt on the other party's candidate or whatever you you do up as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] well and then finding the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I'll testify I'll do under oh I'll do there are plenty of people that do wonder oh\nMhm so what is the crime that he is\n... ... that what is the charge that blend Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n[noise] [noise]\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating his from\nYes\nThose are the questions that went to ... those are questions on the investigator would have running through their ...\nThat's that's all we're not indicting anybody yet\nIt's the I think I was that out loud that has long enough [laughter] sorry [laughter] the microbes on six six Ninety read I", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "12"}
