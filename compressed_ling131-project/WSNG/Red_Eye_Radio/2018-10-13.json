southern Illinois and southern Indiana along the Ohio River bend as you move into Ohio we get a little break but then in northern Ohio around Cleveland up through eerie PA\nOn Kavanaugh confirmed the left is going to whine about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning\nAnd then as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a prediction because they are too predictable on the left all the protestors go home and it's over ... you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ...\nNot going to happen it's not going to happen because you're not going to move on it when when you know you want to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason\nBecause there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed ... you're not going to have them well we can move and\nWe can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change the mind of the electric cars no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary had a net loss of doors and\nTrump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality\nThey don't look at the facts in anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they flap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process\nThat was wild it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen\nIn terms of extending it out so there was a supplemental background check there was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nIt was a supplemental background check ... there was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the\nThe media or the left of course but the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well what did the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and\nYou don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do so you don't have all the details ... they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself that allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley\nThat allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single\nChance to prove her case and she could not that's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the babies I Want you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it wide you could not have given them\nOr her more of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact\nThat she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just a ...\nA preponderance of the of of running of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAnd neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh the what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out was Ford who said that her the the uh the notes and\nWhether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know and then I think she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we know\nThat there is and if you can point to go to the the\nAs the FBI said we only\nWe know that you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that ah you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point the point is they asked her directly who were the people\nThat you say are witnesses to the actual event right she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right can cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did and\nWith those notes you could have hand them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as\nFast for them because the the story came out that she uh and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI that's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to\nInterview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew then they have to come to you have\nPlenty of opportunity or they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee out where they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has\nOn the no the only thing the left has is again that was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you'd never believe the the the man you had white males in the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee but when it came to the substance of the actual case you know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and\nUh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview\nOr you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe than an\nAllegation should be enough ... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough really is that where you are now the allegation is enough and then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well\nOr it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent such as a matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yes yeah so then you get what you want to have multiple unverified allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing\nYeah you should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want to have multiple unverified allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those well that's not just the if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy they were trying to get you to buy that the allegation\nIs enough [noise]\nThen up a woman says it in this case\nIt must be bully not in other cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said\nAll women must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate\nWay shows guilt mhm [noise] ah everything that they are wild does not pass\nThe rational thought or critical thinking test ... none of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats\nThis is the mainstream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party [noise] [noise] [noise] and they're trying to get you\nJust to throw away any mind set of due process site [noise]\nAs well as we saw even independence\nWhen the polling came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that are witnesses that they couldn't cooperate it well the no\nConfirm yeah [noise] and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers uh the the process was even distorted to that extent\n... so to in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was voted along party lines with with what Chou exceptions really [noise] and then other than that that's what it's always going to be\nAnd it doesn't matter that it's Trump\nAs president it doesn't matter that it's cabin I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was cabin I was up there it would have been the exact same

getting a vote okay I'm being those fifty senators in this case so then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states right\nNecessarily oh well that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with the freedom of speech few years back when the ... came out and it was the big thing that you know corporations and any group people should not have free speech right mhm that their free speech is only for the individual uh but gun rights for for the groups right [laughter]\nFor the militia but not the individual and we should know the the bill of rights ah is\nAh about the individual and groups of individuals because you have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the argument that on freedom of speech while a cause they decided to stick to corporations even though would evolved of a ... as we know I'm\nOf the possibility of a tyrannical government hey welcome to the second amendment [noise] doubt they're excuse [noise] then pointed of course directly to this\nPresident but it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment and\nIt's often too little too late for the left they call for something something changes well we didn't know it was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change doing away with the Senate completely we didn't know we were going to happen but we've got someone else was going to pay for\nIt yeah well lesson learned\nWe didn't know we were going to happen\nBut we've got someone else was going to pay for it yeah well lessened more you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all the more\nYou know the the whole um changing of the first amendment\nIsn't just about protecting their free speech because of the things they want to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigoted\nIt needs to go away completely\nBecause we disagree with the\nFreedom of speech while we protect that when it's a it's our group talk we don't want you to be able to talk you don't have freedom of speech example

McNamara eight six six Ninety run I let's go to Brian in New York City Brian Hi you're on the road I radio walk on the line Brian\nThank you for taking my call gentleman aspires to convert our heroes go and and the confirmation it it wouldn't matter who is elected president of the Republican side they would have done this to anyone rub the crews ... whoever you know just plain chairs the way Trump fights back here it's like a lie on\nAnd and and and and and\nHe just makes me very proud to be in America and then actually very proud to say that I voted\nI er I Would say this Bryan that I I'm not sure and we will we will never know but I'm not sure how another Republican would have reacted to the heat on Kavanaugh if they\nMight have withdrawn his nomination and I think that's something to consider is that is it that Trump or wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that nomination that's a possibility I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell thank you for taking my call\nAnd your wife ... or you take care and but he brings a point that we've made along we met last week made of the week before and I you know while this is what you get when you get Trump\nNow this would have happened no matter what is this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the less behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past\nRepublicans other Republicans might have been ... apparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past have had been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a ... because we don't we'll never know\nIf Ted Cruz at one or is he mentioned a Rubio or anybody else another Republican were there or Mike Pence I have no idea uh we don't know if if they would have withdrawn the nomination\nUm when the press this president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check 'em you know the giving it the entire a vetting process of seven complete background checks [noise] so I I don't know I but I Do know that this president has been less willing to back\nBut we said from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and\nThen along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nAnd then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted grew signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one not too but a\nTotal of four they're really really voting for groups and so our time trying to um ... and and I I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really\nDo anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but\nOthers may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision or you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I if I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head\nOf that work you are back them in order\nTo you know uh to to have them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the ride a Ford judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about ... what the work and\nAnd and the results of the work\nOf this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently\nUh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates 'em by\nThe end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to a mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that\nThe left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to swallow debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in that said young people that vote Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham ... and the fight to defend\nTrump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his pick your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech [noise]\nYeah and and except for yeah it's really a ... there were some things I disagreed with her honors and beach and like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass\nAnd the big past which he shouldn't have done because Dianne\nFeinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with\nAnd to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and ah but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense then this is Susan Collins defending\nThe great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh a ... you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to uh uh get done as\nA Republican or Republican is party right now is a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives a moderate liberal really is as many when you come when it comes to\nSpending culturally uh probably ... or more right than they've been in a while a more constitutional us than they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues\nAre there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and\nYou know and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party [noise] as I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity\nPart of it is the fight [noise] uh from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric but in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and uh\nFight in rhetoric\nBut in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them\nAnd you know even you know going after sessions as you still goes after them as he did others early on major thing okay doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh wasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and\nI don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know or what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham\nTo still be on the Sunday Morning news shows same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right ... ... you know and that's it because that's where the effort has to be ... we can still have\nThe discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change\nFiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I think we are light years right now as to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lab while in social media\nAnd then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially a for her run and that kind of again ... ... there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\n... letting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat ultimately on other and the vote on other issues I'm\nOn the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill\nOf building building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process but I Do believe they can change the process and other items\nIf they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate and we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good well and the way the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't before they know that's it's not going to have\nYou know it's nothing but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen they are willing to do and\nAnd work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that most has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution you can get a few things done if you're not unified\nBut I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues\nNot defending somebody when you talk about those are all usually moral issues and that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they were able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity\nInto two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty and\nGet legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against state yeah ...\n... or a book or right by the way I remember\nAfter the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before that eight six six Ninety run I\nBefore

[noise]\nAnd I don't believe this is just about ... I think it is about the fact that you have the as I've said why'd I think we're Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as social is a quarter and\nSaid why I think it was Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as social is a quarter an app and democratic but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how why did the Republican Party is a ... right now\nAnd this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact\nThat they listen to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about a mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ... they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us a presumption of ... of of of innocence\nYeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world look here's your forecast\nAs cleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever get the U.S we are looking at again today for clear skies in the region the Florida Panhandle the big band in fact the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all\nThe way over to southern Florida looks to be dry today as a big pool of Canadian air has now filtered in through that portion of the country we're going to pick up some rain showers for portions of the mid west especially southern Illinois and\nWhen a Obama won I voted for two judges that hates it so Chuck Schumer name one person on this list she thinks acceptable there is a\nTough pollen in the New York times today than that attacks you I Want to put something up Frank Bruni writes\nI Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged approach from above ... was quite so a logical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor a place Jeff Sessions as attorney general you're a sponsor\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy judicial candidates whose conservative wasn't the Thomas lido more ... now have enough on bipartisan point it makes sense\nAh I've tried to have a good disposition costs like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because I Would not generalize McCarthyism thing good\nAnd I think I can survive in South Carolina [noise]\n[noise] [noise] well you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day\nI I think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through\nA on important things that that ah the matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and\nAnd who knows what kind of other nomination process we may go through a wild trumps the president but uh you know making some very solid point\nUh the what was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right uh Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president\nAnything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left one or do you use that\nAnd [noise] and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the ... by porters and\nWilling to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was\nBut of course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left [noise] and you were outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is calm the New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and what he was talking about the merits it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a prompt has been mean woman called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it seems I mean he doesn't get what\nTwo and therefore somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it really\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and [noise] I don't know I have to go back on ... and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday it was based on the lack\nOf merits of the case and the and and on the larger a much to a larger than a pretty much the treatment of capital\nBy the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look the Democrats on the committee for Frank Bruni has nothing to read the article he's got nothing well he's\nGet angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham where is flawed\nAt all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do\nWith ... there's a case with this nomination process or with\nThe witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we have made\n[noise] [noise]\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest going to drive them nuts and moral and correct and arise and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalked about the actual things that ... Lindsey Graham brought up a gold point by\nPoint and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying to\n\nThem I mean it is again a\nThe they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate cannot the debates to an step by the end ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what they well they used to be for drunk now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n... ... ... ... ...\nWell from their world ... absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this I don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominees that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bruni can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham dad and I might in the future ... are you running for attorney general right [laughter]\nI Wonder if you want to eat or to general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it he's only doing this because well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have\nAs he was against Trump and now he's for Trump\nWe've we've said with these simple ten you know are arguments that will never and I called them simple to arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that\nAren't aren't even a a pertinent to what you're discussing\nReverted telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah you have no evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti\nTrump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash\nJust ... ... ... that it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect\nDon't tell you that they are no they don't but\nBecause they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect are\nStill trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is\nWell he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes Trump's debate him on the points made on that day Mr Bernie can't can't do it eight six six Ninety run I had\nTo go with what I radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three night when I radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom for eighty years Detroit Diesel has been the legendary driving force inside many of the best known for us on the road through our latest destroy technology Tony ... says he earned a reputation of\nBeing a total loser solution dedicated to moving up time and our customers bottom line and we're committed to continuing legacy for another eight years and the one he demanded off demand Detroit eighty years of innovation dedication and recognition [noise]\nA great products as there's a great look how's liver caters introducing new logo on their new labels houses more than just their diesel treat anti jail they have a full family of great products from house meaner powered leader of the top of the line diesel in ... and looper\nCaters to house multi purpose liberator and penetrating oil an alcohol free products with over one thousand one uses so much for the new logo and almost ... products on the market how's lubricate or a family company with a family of products that you can trust\nIn F.

if it's relevant but I think that if mark judge were to possibly um super slander\nA stock report or other not whatever his name is uh uh I think that men do some I think I\nThink that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to hit on this guy um but I think that if judge we're the super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen Depp he could not under the same rules of capping off down or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was when I say\nBrought him I think it would slow them down that we give them food food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further um maybe there's something there and maybe there's ... they've already heard from judge at or ... or is lawyers\nBut certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was was was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else\nAh that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ...\nHere's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak forward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it\nBecause what responsibility do they have\nIn a case brought by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whomever lead to through the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out there and\nThat you could see\nI think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him yes you have in any case eliminate because I think we're getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right I the only possibility of bad as it is you wouldn't want to put his good buddy or do they already the wind is yeah yeah you got tempered problems and I wouldn't want them to think that there is joined us in spite used was invited to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every a predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question ah he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process uh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge\nThat wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden but you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that is that survived at all was Dr ... claim and\nAnd it appears they do not want to pursue that any further\nSo that's why I'm ... and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so yeah he wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah to me that would even be a\n... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor for that and I'm just using right that\nThat as a possible exception here right ah but with the any case to me that's clear I mean it go in going after Cabot all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape ... spiking drinks you know things like things like that\nOr you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that\nRight ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm because then you've got to make your case and say where's the probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I'd like to just do ... personally [noise]\nI mean well because we're the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play and pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging a it in in ...\nHow you could er he got his um the Republicans\nEnding about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody is like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I'm complaining about it though\nWell ... we're going to handle whoa whoa where's the perjury Hadi approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one how 'bout Dianne Feinstein\nWell OK well one of those ... ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a as a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe\nThat yes of course right I\nI I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that and I believe they have done it in their promise their their ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton was emails there's\n... ... says I'd followed everybody to that wasn't Republicans fault\nNo and that was the only guy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stopped doing any of\nThese you know with I don't know why it didn't get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss it is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which wasn't ended up itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you\nLook and see what exactly what we've said is that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and\nThe whole no reasonable prosecutor would would ah prosecuted we said well it what matters years the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November twenty sixteen and thank you for the call it is not always that that and not that she's above the law\nOr we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice [noise] having her in jail is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to cause it maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to when we were talking to the last\nCaller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness dating\nShe's lying about it but uh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation is there\nIn the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure uh any things in the realm because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborate it so we don't know what she what you want your it's proving ...\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't win the seat said\nThey should be winning a in a a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards\nThat almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed ... uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal ...\nSometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton was in the Republicans and you\nKnow if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there I guess that's what I Want I Want trends\nTruth I Can't do anything if the majority has one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged because there is a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right I'm Sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion [noise] and it doesn't matter\nWhether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted ... [noise] and so the best we can do is get out the truth than we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know of some\nOf his bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure if I'll be lap when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins inventions gives me you're the one the ... and\n... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally everyone in the United states\nYou could take them and you can show them a law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law and and everybody wouldn't agreement that is what she did and they would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that can't do anything about it\nThe best that we can hope for in anything is that the truth\nIs told and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption and now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz\nYou and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ... is that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and\nUh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're gonna have to find a horror which\nTo my ... I don't give it to my colleagues miss them and like they don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went ... is it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\n... oh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right Oh yes\nAnd and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\n[noise] and\nSo I we don't know what's gonna happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing\nThat's on them and that's\nThat that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it [noise] the whole Russians scandal thing we've said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent\nAnd the process the American people can decide because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house or do they really really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety run I\n[noise] usually for your goals eight six six ...

though right now we live with my mother in law which is my wife's mom and\nIf my mom leave my wife have to quit her job to take care of the kids because the cost of a child care here is exponentially Hi [noise] um and we have an option to move down there with them [noise]\nUm I'm thinking we should but to the Baltimore jobs are transferable mhm we could transfer their Phil ... both of our jobs they've she quits also we our health insurance goes to a mild insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers mhm\nAnd so what does your wife may er about thirty two thousand a year ... ... and I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to ... for daycare on that I Want to lose money she basically be working for daycare and helping\nForty okay\nYou know she's not going to know that a lot of for daycare on that you want to lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly it's not going to be there and just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a\nYou know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nYeah come to the Eighteen 'cause one will be born yeah okay\nOh two babies okay yeah I'm All right uh and what do you do for a living\nI'm In sales or my wife works for the state what are you so I'm a control in termite stuff like that mhm\nAnd that your company is a branch and the other city\nOh yeah and we're throughout the state okay All right um well here's the thing as you age which\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're you're open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Diane is on the face but what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it well a line of credit is an approved alone\nThat you take out only when you would want to know where you could get pre approved\nAnd have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and\nThat's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically\nA show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we tried to get the other way we want you to get rid of your he lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one when she could reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of bed because when you don't have any payment you know what you have\nMommy the bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity\nLines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb one buying a used car [noise] um you know what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes like one is used up and the other one is just getting started at that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I'll just give you that example for no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean again a Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body for products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing you think about that it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I wouldn't think anything about that at all\nUh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice of car you one obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought a drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something moment and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\n... the I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it um because I'm just I'm just really don't know I can I just looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting to us than is\nSo I'm just I'm just really don't you know I Can't I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left than it was so cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey they think I think ... Sherman what's up\nI'm Seventeen years go on a high cocaine here I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the town out donating said I Am back in my view in China than\nYou're going to college\n[noise] yeah I mean into college with an a plus for and then paint led and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service that five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges they die and you're right I Know of course\nYeah yeah I Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff in the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with\nThat on crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um\nYou can invest it ah here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that\nSo if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the\nYou know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um\nYou know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage uh what this amount of money in your situation\nBecause again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications in the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools and your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than broaden the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago I Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nFilm my wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can prepare for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early\nCool and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I ... that we're already contribute we don't have much left over from all the coloration\nSo when we say the earth that uh we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to toleration though is it okay to do that or am recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you invested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nAt the end and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory it's a pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty thousand uh okay uh innocent nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect 'cause I I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension\nWe're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're ... those guys [laughter]\nAh yeah no thank you so ah but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line\nWhat if we counted it as a four or five if we Canada's before then that means we need to put in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is\nI'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nBut I mean likelihood as I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly wrong and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there you know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so\nA given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and goes round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting them Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that and I read your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nI'm you know go do it that that's what that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit ... thanks for the Gulf Russia you're joining us this is the day Ramsey\nShow [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid not do that\nAnd you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can be an individual you know we're a family of four and it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money to budget all that\nIt takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board it can happen you know with with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend\nToo much [laughter] with let's really drew generally true\nOkay so when I also think that um they need to focus on why they're doing it to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why might not be the exact same reason it hits y but at the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ... okay go what was your y ...\nRight here I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I listen to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um had\nCats on legacy and love are leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching it\nMm Mm modeling it in teaching it yeah\nI can change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and then it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what you if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders Illinois or some people that kind of went yay you be more nuts\nYou know we have ah we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have something to try to play
