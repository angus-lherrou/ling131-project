Republican presidents and uh but\nWho is that we didn't we didn't catch you you you got cut off who was that\nThe Jim Webb Jim went oh he's a former smoker and he's a former secretary of the navy and uh\nI just I I don't think he would have a chance a nameless chance last time the Democrat REX so move away from men like him Sam ... was the former senator that I\nCould have voted or looked at seriously as a presidential candidate even though I'm I'm I'm not a Democrat ... but\nHe he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but I Am someone I Would like to see you then there Jim Webb he's he's a good man as has good instincts and is able to work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for a Republican president as texture the name\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nA\n... I Love to have a ... who Bernie Sanders I think it would be a ... how would enjoy that I wouldn't do it he would if he would let me call and if he was listening now who in the air and in and not you know not just a demagogue everything out on\nI like him his personality I don't want you didn't they didn't believe him but the it would be a ... call\nThey don't want Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have these stories of Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] that's funny that is\nI thought just you know how to like dang Philip thanks for your call appreciate it\nTake near ... new program\nLike you so much by oh and here's someone's going to I think is going to ask me right away the in Las Vegas Ron with mark\n... yeah I think one I Would want to have coffee with is a game that Titus\nNow she ran for governor hearing loss only two hundred vote Churchill ... was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman and I I really do think that\nIn the tide is could approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't his pitch to\nElections stealth is over because I'm sure she kisses appalled there's a lot\nAnd the ... which party affiliations shouldn't as a elections does his over 'cause I'm sure she did uphold is a lot of those\n... that is just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know so yeah that was going to have copy it was so indeed Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she can approve of any of these okay ... ...\n... except for one thing the I appreciate your call didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well but\nThe the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I that's I think he's a head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou have your national forecast or video roadblock\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible in the central part of the state with re precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and\nNew Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies temperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains into the southern Rockies under persistent clouds and precept Santa Ana winds in Southern California over the next several days should gradually abate\nUh quite frankly very few and far between\nI Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound man he's a he's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a mind and he's got a compassion for for the people of this country a ... he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I\nI I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break beat the uh as opposed to a you know I mean look at Trump Trump has already wise you chose a tense\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance to have a man like that behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically raunchy cameras all you got it\nYou've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge to for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great and made things so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right yeah Ken in nature that Hammond, Indiana\n[noise] yeah I wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise]\nUm ... you don't win much world or if you lose an election you got one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nRight I mean one of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't violate all remember on the set aside a lose lose the possibilities of Democrats going from ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back\nTo the Bush administration a lot of people both to the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nAll right so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecutes the leader\n... an oath to the former nutrition leaders of the other party\nBecause our our politics have become too hostile as idiots we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions\nThat are critical all to are are having a stable democracy that we have\nAnd rule of law is only one of the ...\nWell that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think he shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what ... what what what they want to wait a second what the FBI and and the Justice Department there with a soft to trying to get rid of the incoming president so this is a very complicated situation and she may have been described as\nDry as his Justice Department though but I but I I Would give you one ... my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam had\nCommitted treason obviously committed treason yet we do not try to lock them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back to get a\nGood point can I and you know I said he may not have hurt me I said whoever talked me last night in quite ...\nA new law that we come back to\nGood a good point and I you know I said you may not have heard me I said whoever talked me less I didn't quite say that get it but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with a civil war I presume you could you have\nCoffee with on the other the other side or ... probably\nI Would probably lean toward a bone says\nUh-huh now he's break or you know these things things are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much here I Am\nI Can't stay with Tucker Pearl sort of you ever watch Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kind of dumb but this is interesting because who'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along people of the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least\nRespected them the speaking of respect for him it was going to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark\n\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning I uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard righteous Joe and has a dissertation on how\nI'm basically he can\nShoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of signed on to the previous caller just might be for me um if she really had broken the law and been found guilty\nThen certainly she should the locked up um but right just Joe\nThat sounded like a polluted twisted demonic land\nAnd when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep his\nNasty lazy hateful\nAncestors out of this country and I would like to have coffee I waited on on the other side I'm even\nThough I disagree with most of her politics\nUm as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski because that woman she says she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side uh\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little scrape with Trump and I'm a she says she wants to go on to live in fear of a tweet wow that really knocked me\nBack uh I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength and character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers\nTo just step aside a here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lotta people liking ah his name as Conor Lamb and I really like for you know you know like for\nMore people like him to rise and I don't want to see Joe Biden run again um I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh\nI I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but um you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and uh let a new crop of progressive uh come through\nYeah\nPoint Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side of by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got an answer blows in her seventies Cliburn I think his third in line Sonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying\nA lot of people would like there was an article about ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house and you don't share a committee you're ... if it's not a very uh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I mean to them I had left\nSort of in the house and you don't share a committee or just ... it is not a very uh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know\nI made it that I'd love to be a congressman if you can point to me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but uh compared to the other physicians there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what your thinks we're asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys are surprised me it just devolved that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side that you admired least could sit down

I'm trying to get you to get a look at it\nAs much as the way it used to be that you know you have your politics you have your views and then there's still people right and you hope they're decent but it just suggest the times we live and\nWhere people don't even want to sit down with the other side\nA you know they're just so angry right I I don't blame you after the Kavanaugh hearings I wouldn't want to sit down with a sport I guess that you know I think he's got an unnamed we've got to keep that going Booker Kamala Harris what on a piece of work she is and the listening Pocahontas right the list goes on and on so I I get it that's why I came up with Bernie Sanders 'cause\nI don't know he spoke English is can be in my opinion but I think and I went to the did you go to Brooklyn College where I Would I think he did\nUm and if he didn't he certainly from New York City and uh so I thought you know I could sit there with Bernie ... maybe would walk away when he heard my views I don't know maybe they'd be intolerant but let me know what you think and let's go to a chat in Decatur, Illinois chatty around with mark [noise]\nWay mark how are you going to see the real world and you hear me wrong that's\nGood to hear a I Would like to see oh Alec Baldwin run for president it\nDid you hear that that someone else has suggested that\nUh no I didn't hear anybody else or just yeah

are actively\nCan no way I'm trying to get out of this give me a chance those are actively considering we could have a pretty good guess and I you know what you I'm going to keep you on but I Want to read the list is not fair so here's the list that I haven't looked at it I mean there are others like like I forgot Bloomberg so he'd be on the list so the Spartacus Booker attorney general Eric Holder Bernie Sanders\nYou're welcome got me a check\nYeah I it wasn't that good an idea okay [laughter]\nWell I've done this before but I Want to hear I won't do tonight I'm about those cars you said

the uh the serene issue you know we're talking about it and so it's good to talk to you again on Monday I wanted to go back to something you said earlier I Believe you're referring to something somebody said about uh this is the times that we live in and\nI hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it and the different says that\nI think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more of it's the media so embolden and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in and they don't care [laughter]\nAnd so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage\nAnd that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but all I get your take on that\nYet you while you you may have points I should have brought up thank you Daniel the the influence from the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertaining when I used to watch Johnny Carson\nOh uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there now again names and with comedian but but the media is just such a\nPowerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff [noise] talk radio but the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN\nOr like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name ...\nI don't want it in there [laughter] I don't have a mountain [laughter] Ryan my producer\nSaying Don Lemon you know I mean right and he wants to publish lead it and they don't you're right and I there is any more they don't hide they act like has kids and they're not journalists\nThe problem I have with it is is that this is supposed to be a country that has room for\nWhy is they act like I have kids if they're not journalists will the\nProblem I have with the is this that\nThis is supposed to be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view away to perceive them and to look at things that I mean to you killed ... people and that's not what America's up [noise]\nI I got to answer but I got my aunts my producer just told me he said the Anderson Cooper no 'cause I thought of a gym a cost and you didn't want me to give them publicity but that's the guy and loves it it's about it\nAnd so I'm playing right into the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producer who doesn't have it because he's told me to [laughter] wrong but there there's so many of these actors right right they they want to take on a roll of being a powerful to and making them they're not supposed to do that\nI don't understand why it's correct when I hear that they don't want to talk about issues and I think I remember correctly that when Hillary was running for the White House or the Democratic party didn't want her speaking about issues\nBecause they knew that she was so ill informed will top on it\nAnd such and I don't understand how this country can pick a Democrat for any position that will not talk about issues to do nothing but\nA call somebody racist or homophobic\nMassage in this day and this kind of stuff they getting nothing done when you don't speak about issues ... gets done\nOr that's what this country leads people to speak about the issues and then problems can be fixed the country can be fixed of is feels although right now I think is going in a very good direction would trip\nUh I think over he gets a ... related but if he wouldn't run and I would love to see a lot is I think you'll worry it Newt Gingrich is a very it man and it and if Trump on in the White House\nOr tense cancers are would be good also because I think he's learned a lot but I Would ... would be Newt Gingrich as I said he's brilliant\nAnd I'm thanks for letting me speak in a I'll Wait wait wait wait and yet but it was a\nNo no no you got to tell me who you'd have coffee with on the Democrats are\n\nProbably enhances was torn to try to to try to talk some sense into her stupid head about her claim of being Native American first All right\nYou you got out of it that way it's supposed to be friendly cup of coffee well this is supposed to be an angry cup of coffee or\nYou guys don't like because some of you but\nHe had some are certainly had some good points there which reminds me I Want to give my ah Marcus the show dot com is where you can check out my website and va Chris in Washington DC or anybody else you can email me\nA mark I sort of AOL dot com M. A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. and AOL dot com do with Chris ... who knows a ever go out to Washington DC loved to meet a lot of people out\nThere let's go to Joe in South feels Minnesota Michigan probably yeah Southfield, Michigan makes sense to me is am I right Joe\nThat said hey I'm [noise] I just think a good democratic or a opponent or more Trump would be just the the body Ventura I just think uh it'd be just be very entertaining\nUh they're both sides so you when you need a box on the on the podium and they'd just be fun to watch\nYour bank tough already what he's ... I have to be fair as my producer pointed out I gotta compliment him now no one's a announced officially I don't think and therefore in the ... that I saw somewhere so so you you you're right you all of your right if you want to come up with someone that\nHas an announced except it'd be nice if they made some sounds like there were running so it's okay you do Jesse Ventura what's he up to these days I don't even know\nThat I mean I'm not sure if they just had some stuff on the Internet here where he's been he's been hinting around the different talk shows\nThat he may be\nSure and they just had some stuff on the Internet here where he's been he's been hinting around the different talk shows\nThat he may be running a yes or no guys to art who Jeff solving it you're done okay your time\nSo that Jesse Ventura let's go to ... in a Gigi in Washington DC you're on with mark\n\nHigh ... thank you for taking my call and thank you for helping out the guy giving him a little bit sure and um\nI just want to say I love my country and I respect my president that's the first phone and I don't think I don't think this country you can go anywhere without helping Donald Trump do what he's doing\nI I don't even know how he's accomplishing what he's accomplishing with both hands tied behind his back already and he's doing it and it's because he owns nobody anything this deep state problem the only I think going to be solved\nBy making people accountable leader and FBI when the CIA and when you get justice system but Lincoln\nAnd it makes us in health and third world country I mean ... there's a whole laundry list of things the Hillary Clinton could go to prison for as long as her husband as well as their daughter\nAnd starting with ... Obama and down to the lowest person working in the White House right now under this administration they need to be held accountable and by that I Need\nThey need to go to jail and they need to give up their money because money is what gives them the power\nAnd and and without the money and without the power there nothing and we just started taking this seriously my God we ... the main Joe who called a ages ago about um you know what are we teaching our children I stand on the top one night next to him everything he said twice because\nMy tax dollars are paying are going to these college isn't giving these communist tenure they're teaching our children to hate our country\nTo hate America\nAnd and now we wonder why the countries the way it is because nobody's been taught civics nobody knows how the government works gave dumbed down\nThat's like the way they like something these kids need to be sent instead of being sent to terrorists you know uh to to to do their um say in college and give you stand to Cuba for them to Cuba or to Venezuela and see how that works out for them that socialist life\nYeah but they they don't know that I Know you're in good but they\nAnd now they're that's why ... why does it capture and I'd go down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nYou know people just aren't educated\nYou know what I mentioned Bruce or something last night one of the things you said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over\nAgain 'cause certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can and documenting the kids get them early enough they'd have future generations of voters but you're absolutely right they except for people like me the liver here the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean but\nThey never hear well Bernie Sanders forgiving\nRun but for the office of president United States the man is a pure communist [laughter] I mean what's your name Hillary Clinton is as solid Lenski personified I mean ... ... ... why do we want these people to turn this country into what Venezuela is\nRight why\nBecause your eye on her side to it\nWell people don't understand they don't how evil communism is was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore the when the you know your capital planning on women just finished what we\nCall hold on hold on one second I quote him you know it's okay I quote him Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't want capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found them yet\nSo even there are some people are proud of don't even yeah that's what he said oh you're but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and basic the young people thing today that socialism is wonderful but I have no clue because\nThey've been taught that and I mean it's I I'm sure you were taught civics in school to you're taught how the government works to three branches we had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today\nThey they don't they don't I mean me and in the street I mean to ask people these questions and they don't have a clue not a clue and the building and the next election\nI mean it may be going to be certain criteria for for being able to that maybe you need to be a landowner have to have a have a stake in this you know have a dog in their race in order to that I mean ... it come to my country I Want you to speak our language I Want you to assimilate how you can\nYes you know have a dog in that race and you get to that I mean ... it comes to my country I Want you to speak our language at one each meal is generate how you can have your culture the guy's idea to have their culture but this is America and if you want to be here ... ... ...\nYeah but the government's made it too has a they don't have to learn our language you are good thank you very much and the hang in there because
