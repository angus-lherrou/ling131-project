Ninety Rhode Island David in Oregon David welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high [noise] you know high\nYou know I I was listening to show or you were talking about Booker Harris and Booker Mm yes well they're they're trying to buy votes that's what it amounts to Montana by giving away ... giving away the whole everything they can buy their ...\n... well if they got married it could be president and first lady\nYou know\nI ah I doubt that's going to happen but clearly the it's always about buying votes\nYeah than you want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela\nIf you if you uh don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist nation now they're they're just to the remnants of a socialist nation but in Venezuela they would send checks out in the mail before election day you know yeah it's always about well\nBuying looked like I ... I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides ... looks at people's self interest now if we did it all depends what your self interested that's why I voted myself into a site I vote for my self interest me much might [laughter]\nMuch was my it it really didn't work out for me just laughed and why shouldn't we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan no but what is my what is my bigger self interest\nMy mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff\nMy self interest is freedom\nWhy don't we painting the liberty of it did and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest in flux so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people's self interest is give me free stuff\nMhm that's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe in don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about the deficit or the debt\nEither side now doesn't care about it it's completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about and that they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation so\nFor for both sides now\nKeeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure keeping the status quo of what we get from the government\nI Can't tell you when the banks were getting bailed out how many people called up and said they shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right off the government's role is to give you money well from somebody else and that's where the shift was\nFrom you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservative or voted Republican\nAnd they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and\nAt that time uh you know it's a the the end of the Bush presidency or that the world was coming to an ad remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world\nYou know because the world was coming through that\nUh but the that that ah of fear\nDrove a lot of people after the bailout started happening to say well listen you know that's going to happen then great I Want mine so it became as almost the looting effect\nRight the government money looting bright idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money grow with me and I'll throw bank tried to throw it to me we were saying no throat which no one right way and\nBooting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money grow which to me and I'll throw bank right throw it to me we were saying no roads no one right and and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life\nThey become a ... and everybody understands this when you take it out of the artist and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right should our healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats used to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about your health care well other countries spend less on healthcare\nNo they don't know not for the same services they don't know\nYou can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double for some procedures that health care and ... exact finally healthcare is if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario mhm back Twenty years ago\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college loan um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promised for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation and then\nOn top of that or does that interest me if if I'm really thinking about a generation who's having fewer kids there's the book or plan even resonate with them we were kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough\nIt's not enough so I'm not a oh wait a minute what the thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need you guys and dollars a year I think that and help with raising my child now that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families but by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all this all these items no no no no no no you're you're not\nYou're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes\nRight now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right so now I'm\nSo Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promised me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and it was my kid exact I Want and six thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course for healthcare yes Medicare panel to right yeah\nSo the what you can get me no ... or ... my ... in your ... thousand I Know I'm not having kids fifty thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets I don't get no no I'd rather get the six thousand\nDollars now all the ways that will give me ... well no give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right instead of the fifty thousand dollars of my kid can use down the road right no I Want it now and give me an now\nGimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then you're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be be born you're trying to get the adult votes they don't care about the future they care about now\nSee they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nGreat show guys thanks I was a sudden I was thinking about how when you take out the cash that bombed out by that time with the eggs will be so high that that you'll end up getting only twenty five percent that's\nOut now and then we'll be right but I Love that you're right [laughter] yeah [laughter] there you go there were always like we initially when we when we when we started\nRight but I look back [laughter] yeah [laughter] there you go we're going to like\nWe initially when we when we when we started with the program we weren't going to attack since but it hadn't years into it we realized that everybody eight years from now yes everybody eight years from now will be taxed on it right\nAnd therefore nobody's going to be against it because it's a year from now so eight years old now only be upset eight years later when we actually types that money at yes\nExactly yeah yeah thank you uh well we appreciate the call it but but again you have to go direct you have to go with who directly to the account of\nThe the person you want or the vote from so it's got to be free comics for them it's got to be a free money free you know a Medicare for all all of it for them or you and it has to be now\nYou know you can't waste any time since ... remember when they when they when they were talking about the reports of Obamacare kicking it or when they signed it rather they signed it into law and of course the rollout didn't happen right away but you have people calling and making appointments\n[laughter] I Know [laughter] where's your insurance well I have Obamacare ... no no no that's still a few years and why don't you know what do you mean I Want it now there's doesn't do me any good if you're on the other the other thing you know about ... wins in twenty twenty right and she wins on the whole Medicare for all she wins on the whole\nUh ... now you get on cheating company guaranteed income and everything free for everything and money or you just stay at home that's all
