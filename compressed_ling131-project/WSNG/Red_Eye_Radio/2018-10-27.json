I've always said for me it's very hard to figure out what people are going to do on\nElection day for me just give me an everything the pollsters may you know believe in some of the pollsters do get to get a dump a you know pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even close over the summer on a national\nPoll the Democrats had ten point lead over\nThe Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not

Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class [noise]\nRight and they're getting heads and they don't like it and\nThey're only recourse right now they're still a supporter of Trump what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman\nAnd we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election [noise] so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats\nAnd we've talked about what they face\nSo that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats\nAnd we've talked about what they face the whole cabinet thing I'm just the insanity ... that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that may bud per se that\nIs they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes [noise] so many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes number going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax than we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of\n[noise] rather than we're in the

overall\nMay not change a significant portion of people voting in this election but it will change those small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar or a worse at the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blood the terrorists are telling us the steel and and\nAutumn the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing [noise] [noise] right it's the United\nStates and Europe and and\nAnd Mexico that they're still in effect\nAnd it's killing them it's raising their price as we said when the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right and and\nUh the his you know and they only success that that he claimed the the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's been unbelievable that he's promoting the fact\nThat he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\n[noise] I was a story last week about forward grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars mhm they believe the terrorists are guns that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business of deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\n[noise] or or or or feeling it already and every dealership\nAnd every ... still terrorists really been affected that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices rough forty percent by the time we got to June of this year so you look at that\nYou look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in a price because of steel costs and now\nBecause of terror of cause and because of the new NAFTA\n[noise] uh and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about [noise] uh [noise]\nManufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump ... country and you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits but it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now\nIt's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because for the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now\nThere was a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nOr the farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's for farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers are and and you know in this region in this area in the state and\nI don't know what you do in terms of a of a of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about uh they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up\nA portrayed with ... with Canada [noise] ah\nAny nation that they're selling to ... those farmers ... if they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a chair of the that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements\nA lot of time or around the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this was one of the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and ...\nAround the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this was one of the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the ... the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses are and\nWe're ... we're we're\nUh we're out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession the problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession\nOr in two thousand eight and two and a few thousand a ... and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks\nThat were on the brink that we're\nA possible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money into all of the golfers well limit made all the banks look\nRisky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters\nWell when you talk about trade trade deals between nations that are set up um you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty anywhere in that then your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of what is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good ... well we're talking about is the old you know in the the impacts\nThat starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and of course ... of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad\nLurking out there uh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihoods so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans

you're ... says Roy radio all across\nAmerica eight six six Ninety run ideas are funny and I'm ... thank you for being here this morning we um we appreciate it as we're less than two weeks out from the the the mid term election I think this is going to be a\nA another fascinating time in in our history to see where this goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make\nPredictions we we look at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it because I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls\nActually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many because we have spent his time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we have we talked about the the the polls even for you know 'cause we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off well they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was him and and so you know that there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is a wrong statement to make\nA lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use a you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls would get it right before an election\nWe have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are that are affecting it uh you know and another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact\nAt all on this election it may it if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it a a Trump exhaustion [noise] and I've I've just clean that words just popped into my head right now and and it goes back\nTo last week when I was on vacation and I go back\nTo but I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know that\nThat I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either own their companies are in management\nUpper you know of the high management in the company's up the rent or own their own companies are or are in sales and I started talking about them during the whole me to\nYou don't need it seems that this president at times the things that the only people he has to satisfy is his base\n... in his rhetoric mhm\nSatisfied I Believe his base for the most part [noise] uh and and I think that the base has as his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing what's your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere are staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him\nThat it's ... it's those people who are okay there's some good things and bad things where am I going where you know what do I think and then boom and and so I just thought I bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who\nOr am I going where you know what am I think and then boom and and so I just thought to bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again in both probably straight ticket Republican\nI'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but it probably would vote straight ticket Republican who is just finally ... that was the limit the horse based was the limit it was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk when [noise] and then you made a less of a win right [noise]\nWhy why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base [noise] right\nAnd so there you go but uh what is your

I mean we've seen it he's a liar um he's a he's ... and and by the way\nThese lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that or he can go after them and\nThe I I mean that that's something that's an effective\nTactic that you know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody name your call Evan Eddie a liar ... well that's just\nThat's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nThat you've you've ... you've got to bring you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's a ... well no that's a positive uh what came out of the news story that\nAnd the things you want to get done but then you get you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the care of and things you get all these other things that you know and and of course uh you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know Camilla Harris plan you know this is what they want to do\nOr the or or work or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out we're there's aren't going to work and that's something that is extremely rare in politics even with\nAh other effective presidents in the past [noise] you know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy [noise] you know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um [noise] [noise]\n[noise] clarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada alone on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we should Donald Trump started this current economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing [noise]\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again\nYou you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally [noise] what is a rally at a rally is a a ton of positives and this map this massive group\nOf euphoric people that are ready to take action [noise]\nYou know that's ... that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positive you can go after Chuck Schumer writing buddy also because I I think it's very important\nTo understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising when that's ridiculous I of course you have to point out one ounce of that you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have\nTo point out the negatives that the government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs\nAll solved crime may not really like right well I'm telling you that that that it then that's why I started to have if I started laughing because you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate\nAbout it during the cabin on here and said it's unacceptable to us and we've been blunt that you're not an American that if you will if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for cabinet\nOr you know they were the Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well it's it's not accord a lot it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had\nMuch of the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has\nWhen you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence if you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked to weigh\nIn any pretense of caring about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care\nWe point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody they're not paid for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards of why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American\nI mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you reject freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate and and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people's about so shocking thing that you're saying\nYou know it's not ... they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is [noise]\nYes [noise] that's that's it I'm ... and\nThey're trying to say is a well it's like when there's\n[noise] that's that's it bomb you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech no you don't get your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to\nJail or [noise] [noise] [noise] ... free speech [noise] [noise] oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted ... your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know that this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter] ... what the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country so nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe when the ... move onto the next when well again I think we've\nGot to win for calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting and saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy\nAnd look what they want to do with it and then went back to and and and the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan aim calling or the nickname who's calling is very effective [laughter]\nLiar Lanny I now I made that one up I don't know I don't know how to they can use the ones I I don't want to get a ... or ... or ... what was it I don't know\nWhen you when you when you start and he said sure I forgot what\nIt was just ... yeah I'd I'd probably use somebody's got those listed somewhere on the nicknames ... no ... we've said this though well now it's for people in office it's running it's beautiful ... that is that line said anymore [laughter]\nUh\nAnd and as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father had involved in the ass [laughter] as far as we know about but but\nLook I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat and an end the name of of of\nPowers the on one when I was I didn't know you were on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant I mean that's something that works really is a big word but is that something that's ... ... it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's real simple it's it's brilliant in its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represent [noise]\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not from us that's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with\nDemocrats he didn't like him because he\nHe believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out\nOf the comments he was making you know it's not about one man for really [laughter]\nThe recess appointments really it's not about one man Mr I don't need Congress to get things asked\nMr recess

I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays the Texas ... while anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money\nI'm ... and the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time I was six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank it would it would a ... and there was a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm [noise] I'm not saying I wouldn't\nWant you know I [laughter] and I obviously it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life [noise] I don't want to change and I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards ... what is your life I have a a friend who uh a friend\nMember who ah ... at one time was working for a a multibillion [noise]\nUm [noise] and it is\nYou know how we talk about the president sleep or four hours a day ... and\nMy family member told me that this person was the exact same way [noise] only because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and now my schedule is very busy knocked out a multi billionaire although well at least one listener thinks we are um but but the point where\nThe other day and how my schedule was very busy knocked out a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener things we are um but but the point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing\nYour wealth is more than ... and ... and I also have\nA full time job as a you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to to know I couldn't trust anyone that do that that would be the thing because you know people that what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would\nI'd want to distance myself from the money and salt is set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut [noise]\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars [noise] someone's going to notice eventually ... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing\nThe money ... as I said you know I'd probably want to\nCome up with some type of ... what I Do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone ... well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws without having the money away their laws about giving money to your\nIt let's just say you wanted to take it [noise] you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members\nOr their tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift right well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it out in the way that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle\nYeah and it's like oh [noise]\nThis life I have is gone my life is life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's have a less of a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like when like when I'm doing\nI don't want to change my life I like my life well yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I Do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so [noise] um\n[noise] I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\n... greatly excited about that ... oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that a fight that this is one dumped ... among but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh\nWe've we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that outside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some somebody comes up until today a little shocked that we work in an older warehouse for those that don't yes where you're I mean we really have it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse where everyone

being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same\nSo I but the the the thought is and so there are still challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion all that goes away and I

death\n[laughter] right then I got all these other things that I can think about the said basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away

game and he sold it [noise] ah I\nI I I don't know of all have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly ... like one point eight so he became a billionaire\nOvernight I obviously he was earning ... before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a
