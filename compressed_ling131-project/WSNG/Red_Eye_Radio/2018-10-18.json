Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to after this we go next to be on October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check it out on my Web\nPage there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word first I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think of this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on on the first segment at least and see your response\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally\nHave come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the calls last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere\nOr loss because if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over\nIf they are legal they're not allowed to be here and store in another caller said that what you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lacked the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they would be asked to prove that it's their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not\nPermit them access it's not obvious which is why\nIt is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find\nSo that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them but how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left so the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals you're eating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools it would force strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first thing you know to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never\nHappen again and you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there were no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally we but I Would say that those who remained that's the point I Want to make\nI'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons and\nFor heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like the legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents a country is United by language\nAnd it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed\nHere at Ellis Island they were so happy to have a blended half the land\nOf freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end the loop legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an

[noise] [noise] [noise] mark\nI back with you again take your calls an eight six six Ninety read I were talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what friend in Washington DC has to say about it for at\nHey well don't a\nA a\nLanguage that you were talking about one of the biggest blaring thing that that you even do it yourself and I I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and uh the liberals are lot not a liberal that's called radicals there they actually take a network\nWas citizen in America and uh the liberals are lot not a liberal that's called radicals there\nThey actually taken that word in a ... applied it to everyone on the side of this so when they when they were talking American you know\nWe think that it's just citizens you know\nThere are thinking the whole this whole side of the world and\nImmigration means nothing to them I mean this is just\nNormal stuff and we have been brainwashed when we say American Denise they say American they brainwashed us to think that we're seeing citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that everybody uses American\nBut when you look at your passport if you have\nOne that says us says that's\nWhat we are and that's a huge difference we have to\nBe so deliberate what what state are words have got to be deliberate and that's that's gotta be ah the main thing that we have to do even when the air because the radicals or taking those words and that's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refuse to do\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans they'd be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans or whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nYou know and and you know some of the songs right American the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them as NATO chance I'm going to do that again I don't want to concede the language them at all that's what's important in legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\n[noise] um but I don't I don't see anything to him [noise] and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit no we're Americans we asked for United States citizens great I get it but there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whatever you want to\nCall it ... and so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with the system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRight on the world I mean the world we don't we give a ...\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we can have like the China you might say we give them aid because they take in fair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a endeavors\nActually they were actually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your\nPoint your point is a good one which is we're on a charge of the countries um uh for their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea yeah even though the whole process but no no it's it's an interesting idea\nFor them to monitor their own people at that point\nAnd as you as you are kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're pouring right a lot of especially Mexico right to send them send us the poor and his ... not our problem right [laughter] there's your problem\nAnd it's and then you can also add on to the health care bill um for the health care bill and public schooling villain for everything that have basically it will stop dry country of origin will stops them on a loving them up\nAnd I yeah there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the rows and this is terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe insurance interest and we can make money on interest\nThen we know what my ... yeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only about\n[laughter] that's a great call thing Steve appreciate it very much they actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people\n[laughter] that's a great call thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I\nDo know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I said since then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health uh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know a lot of\nIt it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration\nIt's tough to work there especially if you're conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well to New York trip\nThis power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that I think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing\nI mentioned this last couple of days if they get in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after his tax 'cause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't\nWhat business is it um there's what his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should it's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's one of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I\nPay what I'm supposed to pay into my share but from anybody else's business by the way Affleck Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve a pet especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life yeah\nAnd then a party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't\nKnow what makes America special one of the big things is limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least that a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what are they do when they get here they vote\nFor exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like\nA lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important what's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes\nThis country exceptional that we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have\nEnergy but on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military I Can't\nHave a tank in my backyard or grenades or as let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad\nAnd they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were had the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that and there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and\nI didn't get into this so much last night some caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there\nRight how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass\nThe Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it and then the Supreme Court could say you passed\nSenator has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it and then the Supreme Court could say you pass\nA law that's unconstitutional they\nReally were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants\nThey don't understand what makes this country so special but most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six

New Jersey ... yeah how are you I'm well how are you doing doing good I'm ...\nI Want your opinion on something I was at a restaurant I called up about a job and you're not going to believe with with these people are saying these are ... Spanish\nMeant to get and they said well you go burn the English in the language and our language to help us out with his your opinion on this\nI didn't know about jobs it just\nIt's outrageous and that's part of the entitlement mentality right you come here and you don't think you have to learn language which night countries and when it's not one language like candidate divides people what do you expect them we give people things that right they get it\nIt's like you have to learn language which nights countries and when it's not one language like Canada divides people what do you expect them we give people things that right they get in title\n... yes and one other thing I was asked you know in the same thing on the same topic I worked in a pay one time there was a legal coming into the country and you know green car no paperwork just like you were saying earlier\nThey used to work in a in a supermarket as a maintenance person again it's outrageous mark it's just outrageous what's going on what is the solution to this property\nWill ... you may have heard me earlier what I suggest is that\nUh you take away the benefits I Know the course of course say they're entitled to medical care and I guess they've also said the titles schooling which is why it's so important that President Trump appoint those lower court judges so judges aren't making law you know rulings like that and go and ... you know one person's making ruling that the rest of us wouldn't agree with\nWhat if you take away the benefits as much as you can and maybe more important 'cause I think most illegals come here for the work of make sure you can't be hired if you're an illegal than most of them would go back to their native land if they can't work here and they can get\nBenefits and the rest of them uh Charles I'd be willing to do is they are imbedded in the community and use that phrase\nOur producing our Brian we're talking about here about that if they've been here a long time and they speak the language and they share our values right um yes and I and I and we build the wall by the way let me make that clear that we make the wall secure they promised President Reagan they would do this so many years ago\nAnd the Democrats never agreed to it I mean they agreed to it never did it\nAnd so once you make the border secure and people really genuinely care about this country and want to be a part of it I I can live with that I'm not not for forcing them I won't mention this hosts name I Love when he said oh you like Obama set up strode nominees and say you guys are going to deport\nThem all no I'm not I never suggest that don't use that argument against me that our people like me that we never even make what if you take away the benefits\nYou make sure you know that they have to work here if they're legal them they would leave most people would leave and the ... ones or did you stay I I'm happy to have\nA one more thing I was a county committee and been a long time ago and back in two thousand seven and eight in my town I saw a lot of problems in my town but this topic is really a cheek subject you know\nNow what was ... and it's a winning subject when people like you so I answer to enter your two and a two and I did okay right\nIn the great\nNow I'm just saying we solve the world's problems Charles only has to do is listen to you and me and the listeners if\nNot I can't believe it's not illegal illegal yeah it's not that hard well why we're not as bad legal illegal and legal you know on legal right mark ... why is this is so difficult I Do and the answer is hard why is it hard ... because they have an agenda\nTheir agenda in many cases to get votes or to get cheap labor and so they they hide it more than just huge\nYeah that would really want direct Democrat they you know what is open right open border yeah some\nSome of them don't love this country I even though they say that or at least the way it used by al you\nDo work right like we we uh love this country after these people aren't thinking some some of these people who come in this country actually want to kill us some of these people\nWho doesn't want to work OK Charles just 'cause I I Want to get some more calls thank you so much anyway we solved it let's go to a boost in Overland Park Kansas Bruce Ron with mark\nAnd mark hey God I over have enough time on this but I'm\nA uh like the topic on on this I think from the point of view I think we need to ensure that our educational system is teaching young kids and young adults what it means the American it'd be proud to be in there I don't know if that's being done\nSo I kinda do it but most teachers do not you are right at that course an eye on their ... that happened it's it\nIn my interactions with people in their twenties and thirties I'm uh fifty year old ban such limited that happens every now and you just don't you don't know if you step that pride\nLowering the more in the morning okay so like I said before okay so in them\nGood morning okay so like I was saying before okay so\nIn my mind without we're all immigrants okay because when you didn't I mean when the ... the United states was founded on the fact of what as they say pilgrims\nLanded on playing with rock but the Native Americans were already here so that land was taken from them from the beginning second about Washington gap\nOnce they took over the land and he decided to get in here and go back over the and get African American needle will and everything else and bring them back over there to pick your cat okay then once you leave that that\nI don't even agree with the fact that in turn down Confederate flag me pulling down Confederate flag or statues because that's how my children is real good to have them up because it lets us know that the north won the south a lot\nAnd then Texas southern states didn't even want to let\nThat allowed three\nLight it with audit Cindy from the beginning we didn't find out

go to let's see what ... up to in New York City Pam you're on with mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states are the two ... that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator in Florida and the rates the senator in Texas and I\nReally haven't heard very much about it but um I get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but I don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm\nA several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida\nAfter that terrible hurricane last year and a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because they can vote or a ... in Florida\nI don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida and I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I uh have down for that I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them but\nI Do have inside in Texas I I think Korea is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time\nAlthough we finally won at Florida as more\nProblematic you're correct I ended the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that uh we\nCould be were behind in the governor's race senatorial race is is also a movie so that will depend on who it turns out you're absolutely right and of the legal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democratic side but you know\nI think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think I'm going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about the have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation into and I'm In you know Florida or tech this but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe when the when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have\nA ten percent tax if the governor's race one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and he got as that gentleman a couple\nOf callers ago that you know the states are they can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't you don't understand that for their own\nTheir own them being down there I just don't understand it and why we are not the politicians\nIncluding Democrats in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nI mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored\nThe oh that sounds like a pretty good idea or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job necessarily a and then it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get\nPaying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal\nPositions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is why do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the diversity love hiding that anyway just like now they they don't want to talk about\nThat they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that\nI think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through peach and again I was wrong I was bored with Bill Clinton and what happened\nOh that I think the overwhelming majority American people did not want to go through peach and again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection I'm a people ... people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand\nWith Canada I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did that gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so\nThey ... the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way even ounce that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time so let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast ...\nOr ... rode along\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow

too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and\nThe thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm gonna time my trip\nSo that I have a baby and of course I could go wrong if babies late I guess very late but then they figure out how to take advantage of your dumb laws that happens a lot let's go to a Jeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah\nIn Nashville or Jeremiah owners mark\nYesterday a um you're on the market you know well great I'm well I'm a recently had a had a\nRelationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone and it's the fast\nTrack to a green card\nNow the way have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous\nPrevious speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally I have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally just regard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um ...\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people\n'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant\nAnd then they want to just stay here and and uh it it it's an amazing thing I'm going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm\nI'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything I guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here has the fast\nTrack to green card um and\nAnd and you know um I Would probably I'll run at a time this week but I was going to have someone on talking to my father's rights and what happens in the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a ... George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMartin Mart I keep hearing\nWell George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMartin Mart\nI keep hearing these wonderful charge thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have a illegal immigration we have an in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we were being invaded by the failures of these other act\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America as the United states they just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against them\nPresident Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue is not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly let's go to ah there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan\nIn while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that up standing around with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate\nIt I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but I'm I'm just calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where I heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states and it was like really absurd and I was thinking um [noise] you know how to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the ah with when we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the wars [noise]\nThey were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple you know as you couldn't vote more than once and\nI Would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter]\nSo we wouldn't have\nKnown not only illegals put people voting more than once and and uh [noise]\nYou know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over voter\nId at the other side it ... doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are it let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know or being races remain this you know how can you do that yet I\nBy the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I always think of also uh about uh\nYou said the a voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and\nYou know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that [noise] and while you're there voting wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then\nYou're already there it's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get a voter id you're already there so the you take a picture of a person and say you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know what you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them to see if they're\nTwo of them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them to see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... ... off of that really I Know that do but there's another point that that you didn't think of I don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen that people work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOf they can't even find my name is the talk of Pennsylvania or I wouldn't know originally you know I'm right right so you go in the\n... who are you oh Martha that's you go over to that\nTable you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever wants to marry and vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand us so that it ideas but they're not going to work as a ... you know they\nAre I tell you one one thing I did have a I went into vote one time it was a a primary and um I had a I asked them if I can have you know a write in ballot\nOr right and um and he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in Balad I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like and I'm\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on you know and he said well oh oh you know you're a you want to vote Republican he goes uh or or Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in dollars are not right you know\nI I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't run than if you're a

another example uh\nFor the American ... does in all its name any decade in another country and has children their children aren't automatically says because they have some kind of lengths have residency in the United states before they have yet to\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have the parents don't have to have a ... as you say you know find the citizens have sovereignty and some minor ... and the colors can let us know if we're wrong or but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here
