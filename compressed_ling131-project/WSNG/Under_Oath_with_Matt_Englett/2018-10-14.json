for joining us wherever guess they've been coming up before we get to that will take a look at the week ahead in the canyons of Wall Street\nAnd uh we do have some data coming out that will get a lot of attention this week a particularly I think on Wednesday when the first revision of second quarter gross domestic product is released at eight thirty eastern time\nOn Wednesday morning now the initial quarterly increase for second quarter GDP was reported that four point one percent\nThe consensus revisions is four point oh and the range is three point eight to four point to right now the year over year rate of real growth and gross domestic product\nIs two point eight percent if this number comes in close to four percent uh there shouldn't be any change in that critical year over year number which is the actual annual growth rate of the economy adjusted for inflation now standing at two point eight percent\nI'm looking at a Wednesday morning also on Wednesday morning we will get an update on a pending home sales and a National Association of realtors developed a depending home sales index as a leading indicator of housing activity\nOr it specifically refers to existing home sales not new home sales fell a pending sale is one where a contract is signed but the deal has not yet closed generally a four to six week period\nTo close it contracted shale spending home sales will be announced Wednesday morning they're estimated to come in\nFlat no change on a month to month basis and um\nThat would be consistent with what we're seeing in housing right now which is basically we're seeing a I'm close to ... some of the recent figures have been a slightly up slightly down that a lot of movements and that would be consistent with what we have been seeing now keep in mind that ah it's flat lining at a good level it's about learning at a\nPositive level has been doing quite well\nGet an update on jobs claims Thursday morning jobless claims have been incredibly low for years estimate is sort of fourteen thousand so uh we'll continue to watch that number but it has been behaving himself a remarkably for the last three years plus\nWe take a look at what happened in September of two thousand eight and of course the the trigger moment for the the seizing of the credit markets worldwide and very quick fashion was the layman bankruptcy\nWe've really spend a lot of time on this broadcast over the last decade kicking around um why the decision was made to let leave and go\nAnd we've thrown out a lot of the excuses that were thrown out there the the ... the excuse that well we didn't have the power to do anything which we throw out because so many decisions were made at that time on the on the fly that uh you know no rules were being followed they were trying to save the system and yet when\nThere's so many decisions were made at that time on the on the fly that uh you know no rules were being followed they were trying to save the system and yet when they came here when it came to leave and they made what I Do believe was a a crucial mistake I'm not suggesting we wouldn't have had a financial crisis but I just think it made it worse what are your thoughts\nI agree I mean I Do think it ... it was a mistake I think if we look into the Iraq holder statements by psychiatry as treasury secretary Paulson in the weeks before we look at it than than an keys actions he remained basically in Washington in the run up to that crisis\nI think there's a clear I think mood to possibly even a decision\nEarly on not to do another best friends in other words not to sweetened the deal not to\nUh take some of the worst asset softly ... books also provide some kind of guarantee my own view is that ... this was really a reflection on the political price that they had paid the Bush administration that paid for the bailouts of Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac so to my mind this is the Republican policy really\nFeeling the pinch there's just a lecture and yeah they've done a truly spectacular active intervention with a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac I quite nationalized nation and are they really just I think that they can want to pay the political price I thing full of bailouts of leaving and\nI think then there's another question that follows on from that which is if one imagines them having done to leeman bailout obviously that resentment that share it with a reason to an even greater pitch I think\nThere's a real question in my mind about if they hadn't a leeman had been bailed\nWhether we would ever have gotten to top whether we would ever have gotten to a comprehensive recapitalize I should have the American banking system so bad as it was and I agree with you I think it was a mistake not to bail leeman the effect of not pay they leave and was really to fold every once in a look either the class\nI haven't looked type of the ... and we moved to a much more radical kind of a intervention with top\nAnd of course a there was an irony and all of this as you well know because within within just a couple of days a few days of deciding not to say layman and then subsequently seeing the global the credit markets freeze within twenty four hours\nAnd then they're faced with a G\nExactly I mean I think that switch back is is just dizzying 'em\nAnd you really I think see you know Monday morning that's still celebrating the treasury that they'd had the nerve to leave and go smuggled talks about pulse and number two he talked about being a good day to go to work in the treasury\nAnd then within twenty four hours with a A R G on the point to say the analogy would have been in trouble I think whether we're not leaving a was allowed to go bankrupt\nUm because he was basically just getting ... calls on the on the credit default swaps that had written and those were going to be cold weather will not leave and failed\nUm they they there's an about face a complete change of a change of mind it's a really it's a it's a whiplash or a credible threat of the ... decision making at that moment\nAnd our guest Adam too is joining us from Berlin has written a book on a vast array of topics related it's titled crashed how a decade of financial crises change the world\nUh we've also debated on this program with various or help from I'm from I guess the the topic of of of whether the Federal Reserve did function\nIn the end as the lender of last resort in the financial crisis given the fact a that leaving was let go and be a the financial crisis was such a total disaster what are your thoughts\n[noise] no I mean I think this is the one area where I Want to have to say that the ... the Federal Reserve it didn't just acted acted on a really historic scale I mean it is one of the appointed functions of central banks legitimate uncontested and uncontroversial\nTo act as a lender of last result in a situation to the bank from no bank after all even very well run bank with very solid a with a very solid balance sheet can survive bankrupt or not what we have a Federal Deposit insurance pool to prevent the positives running\nAnd that's what are the lender of last resolve function of the central bank is full over spectacular about what the fed it or not ... not only that the lens on on a normal scale trillions of dollars in liquidity to us banks but they did it for the banks of the world I provided trillions of dollars of liquidity\nTo all of Europe Spanx I'm beginning in December to thousands than seven um directly to the Bronx\nReally ends in dollars of liquidity to all of Europe's banks um beginning in December to thousands than seven um directly to that branches in New York and then indirectly by way of what a what a cool ... lines\nUm to the central banks of Europe are and in doing so it really is zero lost to the fed to the fed 'em with collateral an old time so minimizing the risk if possible um it really enabled the banking system to come to this crisis without that\nThere was no back ready that would have survived you know right\nWhy why do you think Adam that the Federal Reserve receives such a huge push back against what they did in the financial crisis I mean they had been demonized are constantly by many in this country\nI think basically because what it revealed is this profoundly disconcerting in fact about the ... on the tree and financial system which has been\nLiterally true since the early Nineteen seventies which is the money is not founded on any substantial bases it doesn't have a material in the ... the new gold sitting in the federals was of a volts which guarantee the value of money money is\nFounded on the the at the authority of the American state\nAnd on the confidence that he's maintained across the entire economy by a faith and confidence in the ... management of the monetary system and there is something just very disconcerting about the elasticity that that implies\nGoes in a crisis it's also a great advantage to have a mother tree system which can expand on that can prevent um the sorts of catastrophic deflation which America suffered in the Nineteen thirties but deep down I think many people find it extremely difficult to reconcile themselves\nTo won't in the end does put huge discretion or in the hands of politicians and the officials that they appoint\nAdam do you think the merrier drug ie with his whatever it takes a infamous quote a did a better job\nOr an oil I mean in the end Mario Draghi came true but that was off the ... of failing in another even more fundamental a function of central banks which is a central banks of the market make a full government that\nGovernments are legitimate issue that the purposes of managing public finance the needs to be a agency to stabilize that market and the fed the bank in the bank of Japan the Swiss national bank will provide this as a matter of course\nTo the government's um the ISI the is placed in such a peculiar position by its constitution\nAnd the people running it before marriage rocky was so conservative in that conception of the agency's role that they refuse to provide that supports us etched in a sustained way for the European bum bucket\nAnd it's that have you on that part which essentially is responsible for the panic and the suffering that markets of Europe\nBetween twenty ten and twenty twelve book jogging was eventually finally doing was saying that at this point the construction of Europe the consolidation of its fiscal comes all of its called fiscal consolidation is such that I can do what any other central back with ... Ninety One said that it takes\nA to stabilize the market so it was very light it was better late than never but it really was very late in the day\nOr get them to use a Columbia University his new

it would be for you or even was type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of ... life insurance is out there called term provider and speak

Manhattan also my life out of the entire basis of the deal this was true will say for the subprime feels the full two thousand tonight is that you'll have real price appreciation now you have the ... you have a sudden price poll just the prospect of a long run and sustained full then prices\nThat hits your equity and of course it does absolutely nothing to the debt that you owe the mortgage doesn't adjust downloads\nSoviet an upswing the price increase\nProvides a huge benefit to leverage to investors who has taken out to a mortgage with a small amounts of equity they gain all the profits from the appreciation the reverse happens when you guys with deflation situation\nI think insofar as the vast majority of people have most of the equity most of their assets most of that wealth in the real estate\nI don't miss the old and a very large part of that at least as leverage three mortgages to find yourself in the situation with prices falling is really a death now for for households for consumers\nYeah and then as simple model one hundred thousand dollar property where you put twenty thousand dollars down that if that property declines in price by ten thousand you've lost heavier equity\nExactly yeah it's a disaster absolute disaster our guest is Adam twos and his new book crash tell a decade of financial crises change the world and them you mentioned World War two which is my opening to a one of your prior\nBooks the wages destruction the making and breaking of the Nazi economy we talk about this from time to time with guests on the program over the last three decades plus but I've always been amazed\nAt the way that the um the salient advice of John Maynard Keynes following World War one\nAbout uh how to how to go about handling the mess that faced after World War one particularly from an economic standpoint\nAnd the way John Maynard Keynes was so so perfectly brilliant in assessing the situation unfortunately\nHe um he was ignored\nAnd we had World War two and given the consequences this is what I really am impressed by\nGiven the consequences of ignoring the Maynard Keynes line of thinking on how the subtle or reparations than the rest of it economically at the end of World War one the consequences were well beyond the pale or how did that happen\nBut I think that the the really key issue here and it's one with a certain amount of contemporary resonance is into governmental debt so they're really difficult thing to resolve\nAll debts allude between governments so not governments money markets cars and the worst cuts circumstance that you simply restructure we did this in the Latin American debt crisis in the Nineteen eighties\nUh Mexico in the Nineteen nineties if a government money to a bank to some way out by means of a debt restructuring\nThe real problem after World War one and it was a two faced problem was money over from government to government so the two parts of the problem was that the British and the French fighting alongside the United states has its associates a contract to huge debts with the American state with the American taxpayer\n... offset some of that that the ... they imposed reparations on Germany\nAnd all of these states in the Nineteen twenties a democratic states that have elected parliament which have to pass the tax is necessary to service the stats\nAnd so at that point I financial obligation gets translated into a political obligation or a ... and between sovereign states each one of which has to decide to sacrifice a large share of its GDP\nUm to to ah to service their stats\nAh in the case of us the money that it led to the British and the French constitution the full food to fetch will get that are in the Nineteen twenties so this wasn't something that you could hide anyway [noise]\nUm if the British and the French didn't pay it than American taxpayers will get a ... on that I think is the really tangled month the real the real problem of into governmental that\nAnd the agony of course is that that's exactly what we see in the euro is I'd today that Greece has just come out of its special measures it's notion Lee at least um you know in a normal state now rather than being under a crisis regime but the fact that it's going to be paying back money\nWho'd advance to it by the other governments of Europe for fifty to sixty years for the foreseeable future for the most of the rest of the century\nAnd that creates a credible political button a between those states it's very difficult to avoid the buildup of animosity\nAnd that affects the standard of living for decades to come and grace\nIt absolutely does yeah it means that a public services will be squeezed uh taxes will be high or\nRaise it absolutely does yeah it means that a public services will be squeezed uh taxes will be high or\nOr Greece has very high tax rates right now which of course then stunts investment so traits of deflation may climate um in Greece or for the foreseeable future I asked him to the twenty fifth these I mean so I really for generations to come\nBlame here is not to get political in any way professor but when you look at the situation going on right now with trade certainly is a unique situation where we have the one country the United states\nLaying down a tariffs on steel and aluminum or we have ah the the makings of a potential trade battle between the United states and China\nWe have a lot of balls in the air right now what is what is your assessment\nI mean I think they really remarkable thing a bounce it um is that the Trump Administration should have chosen to pick all of these fights are ones\nI mean it's easy enough to see why the Americans might have a beef with the residual terrorists\nOr all of American vehicles are being traded back and forth with Europe\nOr the Obama administration was trying to renegotiate NAFTA renegotiate NAFTA\nThe Europeans and the Americans couldn't agree that you know trade with China is a rather one sided thing what a lot of the time and has been a history of China riffing off other people's idea and there was very good reasons for western has\nTo be concerned about the rise of an old solitary and regime which seems bent on the ... the luggage will dominance in strategic areas all of those uh each one of those separately is a legitimate concern well it's astonishing is that the White House it is in Washington should have chosen to sort of\nLash out indiscriminately against every one simple tiniest say um which makes it very difficult to create the kind of alliance says that\nUm you know a a necessary ready to make progress in bargaining I mean the America's position versus China will be much stronger was alongside the Europeans the camera administration was using the TPP Pacific Pacific trade deal\nTo gain leverage either in Mexico and Canada are in NAFTA to address very real grievances within that trade deal the idea was to trade off concessions to them in TPP against concessions in NAFTA all of that kind of gets taken off the table if you'll see ... the picking fights with people that they\nDo have concerns professors that we could be headed for an actual major trade war\n[noise] and I think at this point one has to be concerned I think one will say that needs to say that the likely impact of that on global growth in you know a ... grade in the United states is probably not as extreme\nAs well might imagine I mean it'll be very bad individual industries which made decisions nice a nice to be the auto industry which has traveled across North America with facilities in Canada Mexico and the United states\nBut if you gave the auto industry and you trade regime they'll adjust to it and the same way as they had to the existing on the uncertainty Israeli it would affect investment but it isn't really on the trade side that I worry that the ... for me about the global economy is all about finance it's all about the effects of a stronger dollar\nOf the increase in interest rates in the United states and the impact of that on people across the world\nWho borrowed in dollars it's from finance I think an exchange rates known from trade that you get the really big batch shocks historically\nTo political crises\nAre against is professor random Tuesday of Columbia University his new book crash tell a decade of financial crisis change the world are looking ahead at this Brexit mess in the u._k. a professor or what are your thoughts\n... it is a mess I mean it is\nAn extraordinary message they go to find any other words for it um it just stretches credulity I think the Europeans have always imagined that have the British having made this extraordinary decision but at some point come up with a viable bargaining
