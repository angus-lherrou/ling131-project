hose\nBreeder [noise]\nFunny\nSo comes your way each and every weekend talking about subjects financial we talk about how you can become your own personal financial manager and if you do it successfully you can manage your money for the rest of your life somebody in the family has to do it maybe you are\nThe designated person\nThe person that takes care of those financial problems saving for the future saving for retirement savings for the education of the young sprouts [noise]\nThat's what it's all about here on America's money program money talk\nThere are so many things that all of us can do to make the future brighter from a financial point of view\nAnd we've talked about many of these topics over the years here on Monday talk and I thought we would just take a moment to review some of the key things that you can do to make a difference in your long term\nFinancial situation that we certainly talked about the economy Rhone financial manager that can\nPay tremendous dividends and the savings that you can accumulate over a lifetime from not having to pay excessive management fees\nAnd also your ability to learn and maybe even pass on to family members some of the key aspects of managing your personal financial affairs\nBut there are a number of things that you can do day in and day out they can make a big difference we've talked about for example in the insurance area we've talked about the difference between term life insurance which is low cost\nAnd yet protects the breadwinner where the pay off if their bread winner\nMitt a meets his or her maker than the term life insurance payout becomes critical the lump sum payout of the term policy but term life insurance is relatively inexpensive\nAnd so this is something that is a no brainer category as opposed to spending a lot of additional money for things like whole life and universal life and\nFrom my point of view you don't want to use whole life and universal life as a savings or investment vehicle when we come to the topic of life insurance we want a pay out\nThe index funds from the bond funds um so you have like one check coming in a ... at the end of the month\nWell what I Would do a a certainly it would be a lot easier if you had these assets assembled at one custodians at the case\n[noise] uh I'm not an portfolio three now I'm I'm In portfolio one and I'm\nOK graduations you the death penalty you test really done extremely well\nYeah we're we're getting close for getting really close um the the the the fund that I was somewhat of a upon it at vanguard was the vanguard managed payout fund and it's they would control the money in their portfolio and automatically send you one check at four percent and it's a man and\nThat's what I was that's what I was getting it okay 'cause that would mean that would mean without commenting on that particular fund that would mean you ... you have a single custodial so here's the way let me use model portfolio three since that's the portfolio you were asking about yeah let me use use that and that's the portfolio the most commonly\nOur subscribers used for purposes of using the four percent withdraw guidelines so here's the way that works and and I think it works a beautifully first of all\nThis is for purposes of are using to four percent withdraw guidelines so here's the way that works and and I think it works a beautifully first of all you have your stock market exposure you have your bond market exposure and model three and so that means you have three sources of revenue\nThat are coming in each year give or take from those assets one source is the um the stock dividends that are paid into the stock mutual funds that are then paid out to the shareholders so you have\nDividend income from your stock holdings so that's part of your four percent guideline in addition you have interests coming in from your bond holdings and that is interest income that's part also of\nThis four percent guideline and then uh and this is variable of course but from time to time you have capital gains distributions that are made out of the mutual funds mostly out of the stock ones occasionally a small amount out of the bond funds\nAnd that also represents revenue coming into the account because all of this money and the taxable account\nAll of this money is taxable in any way\nOr if it's a tax deferred account fine that comes in but of course everything that comes out um once here at the qualified age comes out as ordinary income any way in a a tax privilege to count that is not a raw so we're talking about a a personal account we have all of this money coming in a sensible\nThe dividends are generally qualified dividends they have a tax rate the interest is taxable and the capital gains have a tax rate depending on the type of game the short term long term whatever save all of this money coming in and here's what's going to happen\nIn some years it will be less than four percent\nAnd that means you'll have to sell a small number of shares across the board to make it come out to four percent and other years it will be more than four percent especially a year where you have distributions from capital gains it'll be more than four percent which gives you the ability to take you four percent and reinvest\nAnything in excess of four percent\nAnd some years it'll come in very very close almost identically to four percent\nThat is the approach that I recommend for how to go down a enforcing the four percent withdraw guideline which you want to review every year to make sure it's working very very important\nAppreciate the call Pete always great to hear from the land of the money he WLS radio Chicago\nLet's get Tony on the line in Santa Clarita hello Tony\nThank you know that ten thousand a state local tax limit rural new thing\nYeah there is a new law that limits the deductibles ... of state and local taxes of all kinds property taxes income taxes sales tax is a local taxes like wage tax is like the city of Philadelphia wage tax all of those state and local taxes now\nCobbled together can be deducted up to a limit a cap of ten thousand dollars if you have more than that you lose the duct ability\nDon't you think that will encourage more people to buy new deep bond so they could get back some money that they can't get back on their tax return and then that means that the bonds will be able to withstand higher interest rates\nBetter than they usually do when I heard when interest rates go up\nI'm not sure whether that's going to actually happen I Would say that if interest rates go up in a small bond prices will go down\nAnd I think that they will probably go down in the same proportion as they always do which is a inverse to their duration for example if you have fun with the duration of ten years\nAnd you have a one percent increase in rates I think the fund those probably drop in that as a value about ten percent I think that um you do raise a good point however Tony I Do think that the loss of folded ducked ability\nOr of state and local taxes is going to result I think it's already happening in people looking at relocating to low tax states because\nAh for higher earners a for a\nBusiness owners that have the ability to relocate I think that they have to take a look at that because uh the impact is dramatic\nBecause I figured like if you were five thousand over that made you just lost two thousand of of whatever quit or\nWhatever and the top end of top bracket uh in the top bracket and there's another you're right but there's another problem with that uh were two other problems for one or there are a lot of people that are way way more\nThan five thousand over this an dolls and limit there are states that are known as high property tax states\nUh there are a lot of people that are way way more than five thousand over the ... and limit there are states that are known as high property tax states these are states where historically the ... the the taxes assigned to real estate had been far above the national average states like a New Jersey\nOr which by the way it has the highest property taxes in the United states\nAnd uh as a former New Jersey I can tell you that's a fact a New York\nOr California Connecticut these are all very very high property tax states which also by the way happen to have high state income taxes and all so all of those have um a ... so you have all of these taxes you had this ten thousand capture your higher earners take a look at this\nAnd they have to take a look they have to take a look at no or low cost DOMA styles I mean they have to because ah it would be a irrational for them not to and I think you will see re locations\nAnd this is one of the reasons that I Would not want to have a long term pension income obligation from the states that are likely to see ...\nYou know in in California there's a bill in Sacramento where they want to consider state taxes that charitable contributions to some kind of\nState foundation charity whatever but if the if it's above the ten thousand dollar limit and then you could claim it as a turtle bought charitable contributions to sort of an income tax ... there's a guy in Sacramento trying to pass that bill right now did you\nHear about the only he does have a ... he ... I did and he does have a problem there were other states looking at this New Jersey by the way is looking at this\nAnd they do have a problem and the problem is it in order to get a charitable deduction you're supposed to have no strings attached\nYeah ... ... for example how well we're not so wanted to go well no\nNo you're supposed to have no strings attached to the donation you're not supposed to be able to make a donation and I have no idea how the courts will rule on this this will all go through the legal machine but you're not supposed to be able to make it to a donation for example let me give you a really good example\nA you're not supposed to be able to make a donation of\nThirty thousand dollars to a a a church right take a charitable deduction and then the church gives you a thirty thousand dollar car that's not a legitimate donation that quid pro quo\nIs not supposed to be that way so I think he will face a legal challenge\nIf you're trying to pass a law that says the taxes the taxes are a donation but in return you don't have to pay your property tax because that's quid pro quo I think this is going to be a a a legal train wreck that's what I expect\nMoney talks on demand is very very popular because you can stream money talk on your computer download Monday talk to your smartphone with money talk on demand of course the investment talk is
