stuff around here [noise]\nWell I think that uh one of the things you want to keep in mind is um I mean first of all let me address your uh your at effort to nuance between the raw than the traditional ... holdings\nOr I'd be more inclined to take a a a an equal approach between the two funds I think trying to nuance between a rock that a traditional is a probably a\nA analysis paralysis that's the way I Would look at it so I I'd be inclined to just just go down to ... down the middle on that\nBut keep in mind that when you talk about um the personal money that you do want to try to put your most taxable\nVehicles for example bonds are totally taxable if you're in the the bonds and the newsletter that we're using in the model portfolios those are taxable bond funds so if you're doing that\nThen you want to try to put the most taxable investments the ones that are going to hit you right away with tax liabilities in that calendar year you want to try to put them in my opinion into your personal account\nA I'm Sorry it to the attacks privilege to count as what I'm saying and to the tax privileged account so you don't get hit with those tax liabilities right away whereas in the personal account as you've already a documented with your very small capital gains rate of Fifteen Percent\nA year in a position to take advantage of the tax law there so I think that does make sense to put the investments in your personal a portfolio that are going to get the ... are going to benefit the most from the tax law\nOkay well the thing is is I Can't really move more money into Iraq without doing a conversion\nOh I don't want you know I don't want you to I don't want you to do something dramatic like a conversion because of anything I said\nAll I'm saying is you do the best you can you're not going to be able to do this perfectly you do the best you can\nYeah and the ... the the the regular traditional areas roll over from four one K. and that's kind of in a way I Can't put more into that either so\nWell and that's not really the point of adding to those accounts is not what I'm Talking about what I'm telling you about is developing a strategy where you can maximize the tax benefit of your account so you certainly have a big tax benefit in your personal account because you were only hitting with a Fifteen Percent\nCapital gains long term break Brian I thank you
