slow not a lot happening on Tuesday as well but on Wednesday we will get the report on existing home sales now\nExisting home sales are important because they comprise close to Ninety percent\nOf housing transactions\nAnd the way they derived this figure is they tally the number of previously constructed homes condos and co ops in which a sale closed during the month of this report will be for the month of July\nAnd I'm given the fact that existing transactions are like Ninety percent of all housing transactions\nIt is a matter of importance this figure that's expected to come out and then you were rated a five point four to five million that would be up from the prior month\nAnd uh it's been clicking along fairly close to the mid ... over the past year\nAnd a fairly flat lined experience with this one but um\nWe have seen a rise in pending home sales\nVending home sales will be coming out later so um we could see some improvement in this number and that's why we are using a consensus estimate of five million four hundred and twenty five thousand\nThat would be an easier and you all those figures that would be an increase of about\nForty five thousand over the prior month or less than one percent but still at a a healthy level\n\nWe will also get the federal open market committee minutes of their last meeting of this meeting was fairly close to a non event because it

University of California over thank you for joining us such great have you with us\nThanks for having those wrote this book\nYou know when you look out there today I feel like everybody feel it feels like everybody's part of the gig economy we're familiar with things like liver and up work but\nWe look beyond that and we start to see that really any on demand services or project based services that can be provided by anyone or part of this gig economy when we start to see how really big is\nAnd I wanted to give people a leg up away to get chosen and the the nature of work\nAnd we use this expression and uses expression in your book the gig economy told us what is meant to get on them\nSo they kick economy truly come back to think you have something as a gig right like you might think of from the\nAd a gig so something that his project base something that is temporary so project states are on demand services that can be provided by anyone and when we think about it in terms of United States is just ugly we might think of it in terms of ten Ninety nine labor labor\n[noise]\nNo you using expression in your book a unique value proposition told us a little about that\nOkay so when we look at value proposition what we have to understand is that how\nAll of us right a value proposition isn't inherit promise of benefits\nThat accompany gives its customers are employees or business partners and we look at that and we say what benefit minus cost but a lot of time a cost isn't really money\nUnique value proposition says hey what is it that you are able to provide that someone is not willing to provide or doesn't provide as well and that's the ... and so the idea of why someone in particular is incredibly\nImportant when it comes to understanding the gig economy and how to survive in it because you want to not only get chosen one you want to get chosen again and again and again\nIt certainly seems when you when you look at the world of the ... was liberated so in recent years\nIt's certainly a I mean let's say common sense would tell you that while this has been great for entrepreneurship that this has really generated a U.S who love me of a of a revival though to worship the issues that were\nI think it's interesting because in some cases you can look at the gig economy is kind of like a mini step towards entrepreneurship right out of a sudden I'm working\nIndependently I'm working for myself and I can see if like how I stack up against buffet other ... other people on care dot com or something like that but at some point\nEven the gators themselves will start\nTo hire out or even before you become yourself ... you may become comfortable using something like air being the\nSo you're actually becoming part of the gig economy without necessarily yourself up putting yourself out there as a gig\nAnd as you get more comfortable with this starts to proliferate and we start becoming more comfortable all of a sudden we see on both sides not only am I putting myself out there let's say on air being be as a as a or B and the host or an experience house\nBut also I myself I'm going out there and using those services whether it's left all all those are the most popular and that's fine with her to understand that beyond the lifted the world there are hundreds and hundreds of apps\nThat specialize in very specific types of gigs so if I Want to get a massage or something for that if I Want to find somebody that fellows or something very specific\nSo if I Want to get a massage and something for that if I Want to you know find somebody that fellows or something very specific I can find something for that so yeah that whole thing of there's an app for that certainly applies to the gig economy as well\nOur guest is Olga miserably of University of California and her new book is the gay goes up thrive in the gig economy where old jobs are up to leap and freelancing is the future is that what you see it the ... and use the future\nI think that when we think of jobs in terms of job security I think that's what's missing now so regardless of whether I'm a freelancer on a traditional worker the surveys show that goes group don't feel very secure in that position\nSo if I was promised the gold watch good pension and I no longer have that then what's my alternative\nSo that's why I say freelancing is the future this idea that you constantly now have to you and walk to quite frankly keeps your skills updated and be the best person to choose for that job going forward\nAnd then I Do you get chosen again and again and again on those teams so it's not like you're constantly having to pick up everything from scratch pick up everything from scratch bet yes make those relationships and have those great teams that move forward a move you fall it\nOlder you have a chapter that discusses reviews rejection and redemption till this little bell but\nYes so fast and there's nothing that puts more fear and especially a small business owners heart but I'm sure also all of us because we now all get reviewed whether it's a Lincoln recommendation\nFor the otherwise known as the people I get rich on whether my places up to snuff even as\nA passenger right if you are a passenger of an ... you actually get reviewed by those taxi driver\nAnd so all of a sudden there's this new going on where everybody's getting ready and is that going to lead to people behaving maybe a little bit nicer possibly possibly I'll tell you one thing that is a seismic shift\nThere is a company right now outside of Washington DC called snack work and they actually higher so the company itself snack hires college students and then contracts\nWith restaurant industry and hospitality industry in the area so let's say five guys burger and so now as a student I can pick up a couple of chef at\nFive guys I show up at five guys isn't my employer snack work as my employer\nSo everything goes out so I'm showing up for my shift in my five guys uniform and at the end of my shift guess what's now going\nTo wait my manager to review my manager I don't know any other time in our existence that this has been happening now this is something brand now where the reviews come up with\nChanging world for sure our guest is Olga miserably of University of California her new book the gauges up thrive in the gig economy we're taking your calls for Olga at one eight hundred\nNine three four twenty to Twenty one good time to call his right now one eight hundred\nNine three four twenty to Twenty one and you can speak\nDirectly to hold them is why he and um discuss her new book the gig is up driving the gig economy\nWith old jobs are up slowly freelancing is the future your questions were older when we return one eight hundred nicely for forty to forty one just one\n\nMoney\nLiberty mutual insurance knows you're focusing on the road right now so we'll just describe our new billboards to you do horizontal rectangles with a yellow background the headline\nTo the old model a work for a company get your gold watch get a pension or not have to worry much about unemployment than the you know being a a contractor your entire life with Fifteen thousand different drugs\nAnd I'm not up to worry much about unemployment than the you know being a a contractor you're tired of work with Fifteen thousand different drugs through your career would you do it\nYou know that's a that's an interesting a question of first of all I guess I should thank you for thinking that I'm a millennial [laughter] actually Gen x or [laughter] and in terms of baby boomers all specifically be speaking I'm a A R P actually in October in Houston\nA specifically on the topic of baby boomers and the gig economy because what we're finding is that a lot of boomers are coming to where they don't they don't feel secure in how much retirement they possibly have or they don't feel secure in the fact that\nThey'll still have like they want to keep on working but they don't know how to keep on working and part of it I think about is the stigma you know when we look at what contract worker was thought of as\nRight and in some cases still is but I'm seeing it less and less and less\nAnd when we think of a contract worker within in an environment even a corporate environment they were really thought of as less them right like I don't know how many times I went in and it was the broken chair\nAnd um you know good luck finding an office supply and good luck getting invited to the meeting right but now it's a lot better with the tools that are available and I don't think there's the stigma as much anymore as there was in terms of going towards um the contract work\nSo to answer your original question I don't know if it's possible to turn back those kinds of time and I think there are some opportunities here as far as getting to be known for\nWhat your best shot and hopefully establish yourself almost as your own brand so that you feel secure going forward in what you do\nWell things are changing ... you will know probably better than most I Need to ask you do we need to rethink ... benefits because of the gig economy\nThat is such an excellent question you know you you hear somebody like you on mosque out there and they they would like for\nUs to have kind of like a living social wage because and it's not just this idea of the gays economy it's also automation right this idea that\nYou know by some statistics Ninety percent of all jobs will be automated out or through artificial intelligence be be put to that place we don't really know what's gonna happen because you know every time we think we know something else happens and innovation happens and and other things kind of show themselves\nBut at some point we may look at it and say okay well if Ninety percent of our workforce if this is true right that Ninety percent of our workforce will look differently doesn't make sense to have a different type of social safety net so that people have a living wage regardless of whether robots doing their job or not\nAnd that will be an interesting conversation kind of going forward I can tell you that where we are today they're still very much a need for humans\nAre just as old room is right at the University of California or new book the gig as a thriving the gig economy we're all jobs are obsolete in religion is the future\nWill you know back in the ... or if you've been around a while and you were making good money\nThey used to call you a consultant has it changed\nIn some ways yes because the consultant moniker\nThat also meant that you were your own business right like you had a small business you are the one that was responsible for marketing you're the one that was out there getting that work whereas now as a consultant I I can choose to be on a platform such as up work\nAnd let my works to speak for itself and let the marketplace Dr kind of the pairing of the work to the consultant\nSo it's it's changed a little bit you have a job\nThrough all moving from freelancer too employer told us a little above the concept\nThe concept really comes down to this idea that at some point if you're thinking like an entrepreneur then certain\nParts of your time are more valuable spent doing something else so unless you get particular joy in you know picking up dog poop and walking your dog then maybe you think to yourself you know what if I hire somebody to be a dog Walker twice a day I can focus on this project\nAnd I can earn more by focusing on this project so that's just one small example of how you might hire a gig worker\nTo further your own time but there are you know dozens if not hundreds of examples like that where it might make sense to do that and we're seeing not for everything you know something that was maybe was previously only reserved for\nThe super rich or you know I think just this weekend I saw a girlfriend of mine who's a mom you know just out to Vegas with Mike Tyson\nYou were rich or you know I think just this weekend I saw a girlfriend of mine who's a mom you know jet out to Vegas with Mike Tyson on a a a jet that was a partial jet like basically something that you get on the app to get out kind of like a a a lift or Hoover but for jets\nAnd I was thinking to myself oh my gosh isn't that different than a mom's a girl's fun weekend to Vegas with a bunch of moms now includes a jet and Mike Tyson like when did that happen [laughter]\nWell I have to ask you ... iron might get involved in this heat\n[laughter] well ... that's all boy like there that the fact that there is a basically a platform or an app that allows you to buy a seat on a private jet and you might be sitting next to anyone including Mike Tyson is a\nIs definitely I opening\nThe was accidental did you happen to be on the plane or was this a of a trip that include was ... because it ...\nIt's like it's like as if you ordered a taxi and the taxi shows up and Mike Tyson's already in the taxi but in this part she knew it was a ...\n[laughter] ... so is there enough that I can use to a wind up losing next describe ...\nI Believe it's called ... [laughter]\nIt does to us to borrow for me or you have a job or you just touched on time management you have a chapter the things you're not going to think about time management is one of them was a little about that\nI think that when you work for yourself and especially when you get into where you're doing this a lot ah so you're either doing multiple side gigs or fight hassles or you have one main kind of gig [noise] it's very easy to lose yourself in this\nConcept of just being lonely you know we sometimes take for granted water cooler talk and being able to just\nTalk to somebody in the morning or over a cup of coffee or whatever and when you're constantly divided by your laptop screen even though you might be sitting at a Starbucks right or you might be sitting in your home office it's sometimes difficult to\nCombat the loneliness in that respect and also time management because now nobody's going to be looking over your shoulder to say oh you just spent the last two hours on Facebook [laughter] right it's up to you on whether you got\nKind of stuck down the rabbit hole of fake news or if you\nUm actually focused on your project and worked at through so you know all of a sudden we have to be a little bit more adult and how we treat our time and luckily there are tools for that whether they're on your phone or your laptop or even within your browser like there's um there are several tools for your browser depending on which one is that you can actually block\nSocial media during certain times so that you're not tempted\nTo uh to follow what all your friends are doing and get a serious case of phone mail fear of missing out\nSo has ah is the gig economy has contributed to a freelancers needing special services we're just going\n[noise] yeah so you know it's still in its infancy but I noticed that as of last year um there was a couple of bipartisan senators one being Sarah Mark Warner\nWho looked at something by the name of portable benefits this idea that hey if I Am constantly changing from a you know the type of work and my employers not always the same how can I keep my benefits relatively constant so there's\nThere's that there's um a new type of insurance put out by the freelancers union\nThat is more like a disability type insurance that says rather than like an ass lack where it's a particular employer and you know you hurt yourself on the way to work well what happens if you're a freelancer and you hurt yourself in on the way to work\nYou know ... where is that safety net so we're starting to see kind of products like that emerge um in terms of insurance and that's not to mention like\nA bunch of other types of services whether it's food delivery or you know getting your nails done or you know who knows what other services that might also cater to freelance workforce but those particular ones caught my eye because they're fairly universal in the needs that we all have from an insurance standpoint\n... a pillar morning talk listens to cross the ... what you would like them to take away from your book the gig is\nTo not be scared you can do it when you go out there you have an individual unique contribution to give and I'm so looking forward to what that is because you're just going to kill it and I look the connecting with you and telling I'd love to know about your journey and you're\nAnd I'm so looking forward to what that is because you're just going to kill it and I look like connecting with you and telling I'd like to know about your journey and your readers are and your listeners are more than welcome to find me on chunk of change dot com and um I'd love to hear from them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "city": "Torrington", "day": "07"}
