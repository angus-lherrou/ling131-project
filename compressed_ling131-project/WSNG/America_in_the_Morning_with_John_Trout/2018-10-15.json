who was by ... so just assume that\nOkay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans ... ... ... well not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties because keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake said but it's also the state that was represented\nA by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was not the case in the end and they weren't describing his behavior in the Senate correctly he\nMoved to the left or they didn't move to the right to be clear bought a book\nOn that on on that point she is trying to position herself an appeal to the people that might have supported

being on you get a you can get away with that\nNew York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right [noise] and you can be a Democrat and say look I Know all of people are nuts everybody here is crazy were nuts and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might\nBe a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to\nA historically speaking\nAnd soft Republicans I remember he said he'd rather than an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in this state yeah\nThat's a huge number of people in New York state death either by the way um you know and this and this is that said that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience ... gun rights it's my rights\nOr yeah the gun doesn't Amazon even doesn't that doesn't have any right by the gun has no right to gun doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers it's the people's right yes a very\nInteresting I just want to get to the top because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there's actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nAnd you can come as they design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet but the design as seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the chaos cause even embedded into the counter like they do they uh they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city\nOf for those who don't gamble or never\nBeen when you sit at a bar\nYou can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there at the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose an video [laughter]\nTo be clear you mean they're not giving anything free now that are that are just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of\nIt'll cost you whatever you losing video [laughter]\nTo be clear you mean they're not given yeah anything free now that are that are just that they don't just buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no I'm the those if ... if they [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like\nI'm a ... but but for the bar it they'll move away from ...\nNo no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about yet we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about if we did last week uh well I mean\nYou know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have the coffee vending machine where would make you a cup yes yes I was go back to terminate her to the security\nGuard making the or it was a cop actually ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as team to walk up behind the ... and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically a border it you know and\nYou know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up\nOn the counter ... by automation you know I think\nJohn ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there is no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ...\n... ... where they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy ... right\nRight uh robots not going to do that well either one but I here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd asked John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots\nAnd just a person walking around or do you have to is is there a cause he talks about the science of a bar ... and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can be pleasant trust me I Know a few\nWell a robot also can be\nAngry either brought him being angry bartender or\nA ... can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you do with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place\nThat had a robot roulette wheel now we walked by several times\nWe didn't we didn't look at it because it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated ... right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to everyone it's not crowded like a real real let's say ... and so we thought okay let's see how this works\nAnd it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right animation records that well in in the case of a a a Vegas and in a\nIn a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting nightclubs are huge\nIn in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink it's not your pub writing where is that where the bartender things to be plans that needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that [noise]\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or uh like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol ah it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the\nWhole version of the robot bartender or ah\nBeing to see how far this goes I Want to be alive when they come out with the home version\nOf the robot bartender\nA yea going you walk into your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert\n... vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and you say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nOr go out and then she hands you\nFelt you know like I made out of the whole idea to hook up and then it's ... alcohol no lights up drinking alcohol aids I Want to get drunk [laughter]
