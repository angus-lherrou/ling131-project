of the day coming up falling the bottom of the hour yeah we do with whether it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard if you want to hear\nClaire McCaskill's ad that radio ad that she started running the Missouri the Democrat and the Democrats are calling other Democrats are crazy Democrat ... not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was gone\nAlbert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] yes I think an oversight committee and get your masters and that won't happen so [laughter] yeah well I have to declassify end of yeah while\nThey now have you know that the the things that other ... and and yeah thanks that's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with it a ... it's a it is fascinating though because it has something look it isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter\nMhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today some part is going to ask 'cause the was are where the bombs Leiber not\nRight where they you know we're bored could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a\nYou know about the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible but also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals'\nFirst and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch and and they see something\nWe're these devices ready to go off could they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening a package I think that's information that needs to be made a\nAvailable to the public as soon as possible without impeding the investigation itself if possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked was six hundred down down yesterday and the the doubt as some he also down ... down I think was it four point four percent yesterday and yeah yeah uh the\nUh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that the earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the chairs from retaliatory tariffs by trade partners as having an impact on on business\nSo overnight as it is up and which I which you might expect ... all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ...\nPercent uh Europe a mixture of over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry we know there was in the housing market and we know for example about you know Ford coming down and and saying look things for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are telling us\nAnd and there's something like what happened yesterday in the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possibility you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy or that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the\nThe concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening or as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday that does make the the markets very nervous\nSo uh we'll see where it well and and that's something that was you know was was brought up a yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be\nIt could be somebody in their right it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity\nRight you know just to disrupt the American you know an electoral above a process or it could be just terrorists yeah who have decided to do it again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that nobody is tainted whether these were\nActive lie bombs that would have gone off right if ... if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled and then go off\nWell because I Would think that is there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or\nBy the handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not [noise] [noise] yeah because if we learned that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the ...\nWas the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient\nRecipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we will be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for ... here's your forecast a\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday\nAnd we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes and that system will sweep as far back\nI don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri and when you're inside of a time limit of town you know more but there\nThere are a state you know more what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time but it was interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact\nOf of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we've got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging or not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact\nThat the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists are now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west and\nYou believe in and you you you mentioned it you know why [noise] okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we had we inside this way back when in springtime or we know we said this when when the uh way before that we said this when the Republicans passed\nThe health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm so you've got that\nAnd you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that\nAnti terrorist message [noise] that Trump has been so louder mhm [noise] [noise]\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time had commercial about ... when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly\nYou're not you're and you're you're you're really you're on your ever are on the work\nYou're never offered more All right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong or the stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of people to go to the gym in the day when\nBest time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke go straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy\nDemocrat twice and by the way I was just thinking the law and order\n... I'd you know didn't didn't uh I Can't think of his name uh then he ended up running for da jak yeah jak ran for da yeah he was he became the da da da da da de ... use the fact that they\nThey ... in their office the whole time yeah we've always talked to weight loss named them on TV reminded me that great [laughter] I think I've played drink all the time after application win or lose trying to run their drinking at the end of the day and they're often not wine like our heavy lift all it was hard liquor or they're always drinking\nWe thought and so when I heard that I Would come on come on if they're if they're prosecutors I drink a [laughter] but but yet when\nWe get getting back to the ad and you would said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term ex dream is Democrat yes for leadership of the Democrat\nRush right there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the in their internal were showing that this was\nA ... day you know this was a way a hot button or that they could connect to someone\nOh in that this was\nThe day you know this was a way a hot button or that they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was huge\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of cold out research response that you get the because there's there's no other way to do there is no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty pretty close to the closest Senate race right now\nUh so I think it's it's clear that\nThey want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise vote for McCaskill the problem in that is for her actions\nAs specifically with with capital because in siding with her party Kavanaugh\nYou were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when\nWe see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially and and and this kind of situation that is that is going to end could well that issue decide and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the cabinet situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a ... if you look at these September polling ah you know as\nThe CNN a McCaskill was up by by by three ... with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was up until I was nine twenty nine to ten to and\nIt was a tie and then you know\nThrough that whole time the cabin all thing and ms Missouri scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters and holy up one still margin of error is to point seven uh and still nobody is at the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided they're\nUsing that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad\nBy the way apparently took top other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it the undecided that's part of their mindset you know\nThe Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet because for them to be to do it for that to go to the level of\nUh from fringe too extreme is too I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats\nMean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion of\nUndecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means money you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent\nIs is is this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board\nBut then if it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's giving she's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given but those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those\nAre the ones that may vote one way or the other in terms for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and\nRight now she has too many weaknesses ... that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of weakness if if it didn't help create\nYou know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the the uh insults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being nods you know everything that you remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't\nDeath but he's mentally ill and all that you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that we're talking about a political party as a whole we've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty six team where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland does\nOr go in and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff there\nThe the Democrats and twenty six team where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland as are going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff or talking you know the whole transgender saying well we have compassion for everybody\nBut if you think your if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you a man and it doesn't matter who man\nAnd shouldn't make you a man legally when you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... the vast majority of Americans believe that\nA trans racial thing that they started adopting a President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no one's not right and and so we talked about that craziness but it's gotten to the point of it's no longer the Democrats\nIn order for Claire McCaskill of put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person is W. when the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top yeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protest\nFrom from the high ranking officials and and\nAnd members of the party on those committees her McCaskill's now as a Democrat believe she's fighting against the crazy Democrats ... eight six six Ninety red eye\nWhat's the difference between standard number two diesel and
