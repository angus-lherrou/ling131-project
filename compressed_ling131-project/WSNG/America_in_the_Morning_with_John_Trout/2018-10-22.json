or a drink with and it's been a very talkative people to pick someone who knew the side which is the one of the times that we live in that\nPeople are so angry on both sides that they couldn't even sit down and have a cup of coffee with them All right so that's the those that's the order of the day and you're supposed to pick off you have two choices there to make let me know what you think and you can call and an eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine and seven thirty three\nYou're supposed to pick all you have two choices in there to make let me know what you think and you can call in his eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine and seven thirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle gone you're on with mark\nHey mark are are you there I'm here uh okay uh my thought is\nThat John K sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I always find it a public and yeah he did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget and you know whoever can balance a budget that's who I think should run against Trump\nOr you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing\nWe've had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd somehow you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget that would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump\nAlthough I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nConserve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing or you have ... have you with is\nNikki Haley I Believe she has an intellect that has a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology and I would really like to sit down and talk to her about\nWhere she thinks we ... and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet that we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are a few of my thoughts what do you think mark\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley in his ... amazing because the lady and surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal or ambassador to the United nations really letting them have\nIt in a very courageous not being afraid to say like it is she's a very impressive lady I think you're going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I I don't have someone\nWith a very large perspective on who we are as a nation and where we we can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in in the global perspective I think that's very important so thanks for I Am this ideas ...\nHold on one second I'm gonna ask you your ... your answer ... question but I don't like John Case if there's something about the guy or does it he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I\nDon't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine\nInvest neither here nor there but the something personally about him I I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that when I've heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that's rumor\nBut something about that guy\nAnd rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you like\n[noise] oh I have to balance budget I mean\nWe we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nThen you know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody has another lobbyist that you know want something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle you know and it's just been going on and on and on\nAnd they can't go on forever I mean\nWhen you get to the point where the debt is bigger than gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy and\nWe're we've got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of government spending we ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government has\nNo money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that woman or during the Obama campaign in the first one said Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to where's it going to yeah I have a stash of a stash [laughter] same out\nOf his staff ... he was going to personally pain\nYou know where's he going to have a stash stash came out\nOf his stash right she he was going to personally pay so people don't know that they said that the government has no money in its own a thank you very much recall very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now you're a national forecast for um the tracks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter now NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold\nHe may keep it is because of what he did right people may feel\nThe way you said that hey he was\nCourageous and he did vote for Kavanaugh so I hear here we are or at least I Am being unfair maybe he really felt that way would have always voted that way or there was no cooperation all that kind of stuff but there are other senators like uh what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever her name is ah she's in big trouble and in fact\nThe way it works is the\nWhole ... a cabinet fiasco has helped the Republicans just the Democrats were always ... they were always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact if Kavanaugh hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house the house representatives because\nIt is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nights if they take back the house\nYou're the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to impeach Trump with hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment is not going to be fun\nYou know it I think it's going to get our glee I personally it but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that\nThat wouldn't be crazy I mean I I honestly didn't believe anything for that to me I didn't really do any of its down credible to me um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background\nI have it all and he just seemed like the most\nHonest I used to be one of the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got old senator we've got you\nKnow I was going to say it seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case I just think they were using her as long as we're talking about who should run for president Democrats side uh Spartacus Booker and I call them that because of his own name\nThe Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined that if someone didn't do that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a little difficulty with\nThe horrible or was it really was it well then we live in orange was literally was\nYeah that's what Lindsey Graham was so good when he came out and said I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now I Want to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do a but that's what they are they ought to be\nYeah well thank you so much for\nThe absolutely I'll I'll definitely call back again [noise] [noise] well\nThanks so much time and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than these and I said I mentioned this is Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again\nFor selfish reasons I think she's going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming\nMidterm election forcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors all the way that makes sense as I've said this\nComing midterm election forcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense as I've said on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why off and none of them will be her\nI have nothing to do with her and I said she could join the OJ Simpson\nAs he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago with many concern that a high profile Clinton presidents but only dampened the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans\nYeah and they're worried about her for half the mid term elections Clinton is rarely\nRally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers\nAnd low key 'cause you can't get many people to show up she's the kiss of death won a party official said yeah I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want them to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well\nIt's worse than I thought and it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and\nThat's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't began until after November and now that\nThat was clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best positive impact and have kind of decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think the people who have been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all\nI think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our candidates\nBoy one minute you're the nominee the Democrat Party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage actually but I like the Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and\nI like our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she could run forever right but don't we have forever stamps forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI could take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give credit to George W. Bush but not for Rocco bum knees in there\nHe can't sit still he can't keep quiet so maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again if he runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of sudden same number thirty three thirty nine mark guys are filling in on red eye radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years\nBut today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have a consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from Ira horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy very clean or\nSynthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability\nResulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and semi synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run this report is a service of shell ...\nRadio toll free at eight six six [noise]\n\nDish HDTV keeping you connected coast it goes from the comfort of your guests have signed up more dish provide drug ... for my truck dog gum\nIt's easy to guess what's inside of the trunk loads of products goods packed in time in many never consider what's inside the trucker the men and women are key business moving up support community the parents in providers brothers\nSisters neighbors inside the commitment to deliver job well done\nPretty sacrifices if for some guy she wrote the engine oil to work as hard as you\nDrive now you've got plenty to manage on around and then we make life in a highly finds a we've gotten all you need more parking weren't grain coffee more clean salary than rather than a pilot finding\nProbably find gain we've gotten all you need more parking weren't\nGreat coffee more ... and pilot flying J truck can service on ... and ... around twenty four seven you want and we got it highlights ... and get them my time with them to check out our getting real time reserves salad and a lot more\nThat you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes\nHeart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy the unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses becomes severe leading to hospitalization and\nDisability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to upstream financial hardship and possible unemployment go to truckers one dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nTo learn how as you can help we encourage you to educate yourself and here's another thing Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to that trucker spawn dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nIf you were a trucking industry professional then you need to be in the no and there is no one more in the nose and the readers of wheat owner magazine written for executives and managers fleet owner provides information on operation he also maintenance regulations and information technology but that's not all", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "22"}
