I Hope I got a cute I read in your child\nThe fall and Italy [noise] questions being raised and we should not move on to another candidate\nThat was senator Spartacus in Jersey\nHuh Tucker Carlson that was the senators are to get the money I just I was I was doing the ha over Cory Booker what oh that's where he's that doesn't matter whether is innocent or not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out now\nSo you just raise just throwing the allegation yeah and and there's ... ... ... ... words later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it goes well we've been through this already\nThat letter McCarthy ... you're not a comments by the pac ... that's exactly what does this same thing that liberals were outraged about is not what they endorse exactly for on the tractors are forecast\nPersistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies rain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains severe thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty\nPercent chance of showers high Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight\nChance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow whether frontal boundary lingering around the mid west we can certainly see the difference in temperatures in Chicago from today's high sixty eight to Monday eighty one degrees and there you have a chance for thunderstorms with a pretty good difference\nThe way I found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by a liberal president who had been accused Norwood acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like to know is just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWas happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I have great\nYeah I I and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process or you know it's it's telling that we're at this point instill at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow\nUp until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens\nBut we're at this point\nBut it is all of this chaos before the actual vote and what is it that\nThat matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof\nThat this was only about the delay delay if as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it um that wasn't going to happen\nOr the one wants to lead got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and\nAnd now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but you look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here the the Kavanaugh we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this in\nPlace while you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when you know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you're getting rage and they'd say well sorry you don't have the temperament\nThe allegation itself ... you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you are and I thought ... which you know really when he said\nHe said uh so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you a combination of the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is\nAnd it's obvious because you and I have\nBeen having this discussion a back\nAnd forth because it is the left\nIt is you know antifa anti flaws we call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism is it you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here\nWhat you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whoever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett\nBrett Kavanaugh and believe the accuser that the the the uh defended has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that\nIs the mindset of a fashion that that's not the mindset of somebody who believes in the American constitution in the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fascist\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist no wonder is exact words and what does he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump and\nYou know they started on that uh and now they moved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand that I think that this is one maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump and enough people hated Trump where it's stuck for a while and then they decided to move on from Trump\nAnd they moved on to Kavanaugh\nAnd all of a sudden the realization as we said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus\nAnd lives against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else who more people look at and say well this is somebody who we really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as they don't like Trump is was a great great great great pick and then you see\nThe same tactics used against Trump\nThat might have been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they ...\nIn that it can hit him oh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists\nMindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day and said and sometimes they wake up in society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist and the fastest\nIn this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist\nAnd their name in fact has condensed down to those condensed from those two words there the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nIn New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of this\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours\nThat somebody wishes you to\nCreate we will destroy your business you wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou think like us you behave like us you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not even realizing oh my God that's what that\nParty has become an it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not\nThe fringe this is the mainstream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's the mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party\nAnd you have a vaccine waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah right because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe\nNow that this line has been cross I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have\nYet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough and then more people will start rejecting\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine\nControlling temperatures and improving fuel economy very cleaner synthetic pickup fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability\nResulting in an overall cleaner engine\nSynthetic and semi synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will\nPay off in the long run\nThis report is a service of shell wrote
