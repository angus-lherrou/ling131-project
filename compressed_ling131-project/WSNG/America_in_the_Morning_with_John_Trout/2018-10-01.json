urine run I Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nYeah Hi I I think what you're seeing here are going on with the Kavanaugh hearings is that the Democrats are intentionally using a psychological technique that's called priming the idea being that they'll so traumatized this man\nThat I don't think anybody actually on the Democratic side that thinks that he's going to be stopped from being confirmed but what they want to do\nIs disruptive process obviously but the collateral\nBenefit of this priming technique that they're doing is just so traumatized him that he will be loath to ever rule against any of their issues and he may want to rule against their issues but if it if the technique works\nOh well that he would lay and the ruling Tyler ... however I highly doubt it here's the IRS the defense either is is that there's not a a you know he doesn't do like uh the talk show circuit\nAfter there's going to be ruling on a case you know it's not like politics even where he's going to go out and campaign after a case\nRight right that's not the way it works at the Supreme Court it's not the same uh you you have\nI mean the justices do interviews and everything else\nBut they're not going to go out and and and do the circuit necessarily yeah he's ... he never has to be elected again he ... the the the ... if you're the process is all I that's why Chuck it all I was coming back because I saw that might have talked about I said okay I have to go to this call yeah if that's\nTheir philosophy now again it's a pretty bad with no we are trying to do is they want him they want him not confirming the or they want the the the president to withdraw or him to withdraw and eliminate it comes down to and and it's all about delaying and keeping them from being seated in the first place\nUh do some of them\nHope that that might be the effect if he is seated as possible but it's so horrible plan\nBecause frankly it's it's just it doesn't work that way\nOr eight now having said that I Know\nWhy some of them on the left might think that which is why the ... [laughter] because I'm kind of Li knows the left has been found out I mean we have I go back to the Sotomayor they was actually being recorded when she was talking about legislating from the bench and then went book um ... they were\nThey were being recorded ... I Know we're not supposed to say that\nBut um and then she moved on a no ... ... ... ... not\nTaking that out of the realm of possibility and except for the fact that it just won't be affected and I think the priming effect ... look it is\nI'm not taking that out of the realm of possibility and except for the fact that it just won't be affected and I think the Crimean effect ... look at it if if he was going to be affected by it I think most people would be affected the opposite way by it but I don't know the way to rule against women and ... ...\nWell the feminist wave or just them ever met okay where many ruined against communism is not necessarily rooming against a female so that is true for um the tractors report that\nWe're watching hurricane Rosa in the Pacific making its way toward the U.S out across from central Mexico in the Pacific we're expecting heavier showers for Southern California and portions of Arizona\nFor the beginning of the week we have the chance for snow and several of the northern tier states Idaho Montana\nOr they they see him as someone you know again they build the ... at first it was about what what do we see for two or three days after\nThe nomination was announced rosy way roe v way roe v way roe v away and then it moved on to win the hearings began you know the meeting before the weekend the weekend before the hearings originally began\nThe first hearing [noise] well uh what are we going to do well let's get up and walk out and then the Democrats thought well no that's going too far well we'll just be disrupted we'll start with Kamala Harris or just interrupting\nThe the process and that's exactly what they tried to do over what the documents well the documents thing has gone away and so now it's about what it is about the Hail Mary\nRemember the deadline was moved [noise]\nHow many times now and\nThis past weekend chairman Grassley did that again and again and again and again\nNow to some extent this heated up the situation a lot of people see it if you didn't see it as overreach if you're one of those that didn't see it as a rich before you I might well be looking at it right now is clear overreach\nIf you're one of us who identified it after the ... story came out\nAs overreach by the Democrats Democrats\nAnd how they're using this then there's no doubt that now as we sit here just hours before it begins\nIt's clear overreach but to the point being that long term you know yeah they want to keep cabinet or any other construction is from being seated on on the court but it's inevitable presidents not going away and there's a decent chance that the Republicans will keep the Senate\nAnd so what's going to happen\nFrom here on out if they if Kavanaugh doesn't get the votes [noise] then it's going to move on uh it's not going to be good for the Republicans but it certainly is going to move forward at some point and the president will start over here is a political question do hypothetically\nThat I'm not asking now I mean but I just have to throw it out there is the Democrats\nAnd it would be a very unusual thing but because of everything that they have done now if they have energize the Republican\nParty to what my gut tells me is the most United Republican Party in a heck of a long time and that's just the last week\nWere never Trump ... are are on board right now and they're energized and the Democrats ended up not taking\nThe house or the Senate ... and you go into twenty twenty you know you've\nGot another two years at least of Republican control what's the rhetoric we're going to hear from\nDemocrats this time okay we need to fly to the heartland and we need to find out what the average person things and we need to get back to kitchen table issues here and then we're going to hear that by the ... and all of a sudden the identity politics by the time we get to march and April of next year will be in full force again\nAnd then it will just be in insanity again ... I guess this is a question and and by the way just to ... to ... for the for good or bad\nThe Republican ... the Republican Party has evolved ... the Republican Party on issues has evolved on debt I mean that's not a good one that they've evolved in on but they don't care about that anymore that's an evolution of the Republican Party\nOn debt I mean that's not a good one that they've evolved in on but they don't care about that anymore and that's an evolution of the Republican Party ah but they also all came together courage huge tax cuts and something that we would never thought I'd never done in my lifetime\nThat I Would see a Twenty one percent corporate tax rate ever ever never thought it was going to happen\nAnd so on a good day have done things and they moved in a particular direction and stood strong if they stay strong here in this case it will be because of of Trump as the leader of the you know the party and so they have made moves the Democrats\nMade moves which was the election of Obama and we saw how Democrats lost all over the country over that eight years\nWe saw the Republican Party being built up if the Republican Party still stay strong in a midterm election where they really should lose a significant number\nOf house seats I mean that's what happens you just normally it's the way that the country's always work people are going to go okay all those guys were in power that's too much but if they did if they don't take the house at least\nAnd\nIt's still all Republican power I just wonder what the mindset will be a Democrats\nAnd I wonder what the mindset of those in the in the ... in you know ... the rank and file will\nWill think will this will this shove them will there be more a lot of my God how could we lose to Trump again how could we lose again to the Republicans will need to be more liberal because if you notice it seems like the Tim Ryan portion of the Democrats\nWhich is the moderates we need to be talking about uh uh we need to be talking about the jobs we need we can't ignore the economy we have to get off the identity politics have you noticed how that's disappeared for the last year right gone\nOr don't talk about that at all talking about the issues that matter to the people talking about where we got to relate to the people the heartland it's gone completely ... but they're on now is due process sucks you\nKnow women women or women are always right women never lie men always lie and men are always wrong in this this is this is the message they're sending\nFive weeks before the midterm election\nSo I just wonder I be interesting conversation and just to project out you know where the Democrats are going to head if I remember the Republicans up nine points since last September the favorability of Republicans and that hardly ever I don't remember the last time that ever happened for either party\nAfter president was elected a year and a half into the er the ... having control while still having control of where you have seen the Republican brand go up nine points I Know it's only one poll but if they even stayed even are only gone up for five points that still in my opinion\nHuge I think so it'll be interesting to see what the rhetoric would be if they if the Republicans maintain power uh I I think it actually will be more of a tactical approach I think it will be about going after Trump on things like you know his business interests or whatever it might be because\nAs we get into twenty nine teen there is a decent chance the homeowner things done and could end would just really a kind of a whimper of a report I don't know if I could I mean we may have to do shows we're we're not talking about Russia [laughter] we've been doing that for a couple of weeks let's\nGo to Ellen in New York City Ellen welcome you're on ...
