starts all the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome today Ramsey show bread what's up\nI think for taking my call there sure how can I Know\nYeah our in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi thanks for taking my call Dave sure how can I Know I have a question um uh we uh my wife and I are just getting started in baby step to\nUh we've got about Ninety thousand in ... and we currently have a three vehicles two of them\nOn line that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nCome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer her car she is a it was about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we um should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off what are all three of these cars ...\n[noise] I'm of the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though so we're good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but not that includes the car and I went down in the car you know in what is the Ninety thousand on\nTo to buy a new job and we'll talk about your life and your money Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut I Taylor how are you [noise] good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all things come up with her for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I cut her question regarding retirement and college one of my one year old ...\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby steps or I'm about Seventy thousand dollars in cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought\nIt I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity\nIn it um and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old\nCollege fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and kind of picking out some quote stock mutual fund to I don't know if you were goes from there\nOkay um so my question is what are kind of my what do I do with this kind of piled cash but I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for for um you know every any given month because about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child I'm pretty much the only\nIncome right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of a set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the red should check fraud towards my how we all know that every year or should I put it someplace\nWe teach trailer is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation that as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first second and so forth so I'm the baby\nThey should and then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund\nOf three to six months of expenses um\nAnd that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case and so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is\nPutting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nAs the household income yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I had a tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it so I didn't know how that played in the car does well okay is that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published it would put Fifteen Percent is a Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousand ten thousand five hundred okay and that would be um around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the oil and high hundred\nFor me I'm I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a person that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would do just go to smart faster at Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll\nDrop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay doesn't affect my income at all but people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread ... personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a fourth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth in aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've\nAlready dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart restaurant pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there\nUm and then everything above that that's baby step three is ... by babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in ... in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh\nAny extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy or what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget on those keep jumping around that house\nYou're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this rate\nThat is what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nKnow I Do I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nSo I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal it currently with the U.S department of treasury on it as a result of having been additional service academy at three years ago\nCurrently with a U.S department of treasury on it as a result of having been a dishonorable from a service academy or three years ago and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby stuff I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of started to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I\nAsk because I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount of people\nUm you know um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be a year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year although\nWhile so you learn to you guys are the only guy on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can get who got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start throwing twenty thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nRates are so little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either after the surge through and lip service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death\nUm and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving as an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time in its forgiven [noise]\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nAnd so like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that I have learned something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nBi ever had you know but it can happen and can I have no matter what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime\nAnd plugged into counseling she has to want to be well yeah and if she does that then she can form a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things\nYou are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself off you know of of her checking account because\nHer when I got ... more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah and and so he wasn't in his right mind the\nRest my case yeah so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of intentionally\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that was yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike\nThat's how I was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go to the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff\nBut I don't know if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man\nAnd be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and and it's just I'm ... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar\nBecause it's so frustrating for the people that have it and those that love them\nBut the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper\nAmount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\n'em now she only did he medicated but she does she the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\n... you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their lives\nAs I Know I mean they add controlled or she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen uh as as as mentally ill and she says she's not on a couple of different meant she does\nWell her ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time but what does she say right now when they call her on ... so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nIt are you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should be telling them I\nEither want to be among them long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the debt right well\nMy husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and I are\nGoing to negotiate after two months\nOh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds or you can hear the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people go collectors\nUntil let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under their share hey look at can we work at a deal or you know are they\nNow you've ... you've ever seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will do it and get an in\nWriting and no electronic access to your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a film the industry and so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are they got really tender covering person here who's going into a rattlesnake then after she starts making some money\nTo go along with her emotionally on there\nSo you can you can give her the cheerleading supports the cheese without giving them money and I think here the rice do all of that there's good news show she can make it out if she makes good choices [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info of half\nOf all Americans now we are
