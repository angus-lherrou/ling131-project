and da\nDa da ... the due date for age yeah third faded so with that I Would initially and they use [laughter]\nYou know get the thousand dollar emergency fund and use forty six hundred to pay off those yeah but not now with the baby I didn't see okay that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total money make over okay and pile up cash as big of a pile as you can pile between now and the time by becomes\nOkay and um and then whatever your piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April\nThat event is then behind us in any worries are frets or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know Eighteen years yeah there's yeah but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between on them to use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at those a student loan you will of lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our next year second child talking you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and if they gave me the boy 'cause I have a lot of girls close yeah\n\n\n\n\nFor joining us today Ramsey overtones of Tripoli eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you\nI'm good how are you they better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchase our life insurance and we got part\nPermanent part term and of course we watched the insurance or it last night and we just got\nA block and turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and could we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are All right the permanent and just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh law or imminent insurance not or fully a permanent insurance which is what you have to do it they'll bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when it never tell you under any circumstances\nTo use life insurance and investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nWho would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would say more new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a natural adviser you have a life insurance salesman okay just selling you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switched to four hundred thousand just of term each and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which are the lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nNew Bedford mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things are you this guy's a lawyer or his or ignored\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends [noise]\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend isn't T\nI'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number one they intend for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I've never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and now the last thing it on our tiring policy um on your car he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our time Ponting within ... eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay\nWhy don't you jump on land or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything you sold you\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably gonna end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\n[laughter] that sounds like well Oregon that down um and and like\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cause them all a bunch of business\nBecause they say oh crap crap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out in these even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been on a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPermanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you about ready to return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the life insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty\nTimes more\nThan you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\n\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey is always there for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nIn for twenty five years is all live on the myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty year term\nLife insurance about ten to twelve times or\nOther than Fifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on their own any of it that's why that's always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price own term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name to listen to people when you go on there either so that's why I've been divorced it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again\nYet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker\nYou know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually endorsed local providers for your for what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies [noise] instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state formation foreign nation wide in Asia [noise]\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and um [noise] but um [noise] and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do that but you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them\nHome with a mortgage\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answered questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability end up terms and in downtime ...\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ... I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us and Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the day Ramsey show\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off yeah the way to go yeah we're happy about that a decided to you know sell Austin investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nAlthough it might not people's money ... interests\nThat's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great but you know the good problem I have is we were able to sell some talk option and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollars that I'm trying to figure out what to do with um excuse about about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also invest in the amount of money and the market and I'm five foot homes we for about ten home\nI'm a little nervous about possibly also invest in the amount of money in the market and I'm five foot palms we for about ten home in the ... and I'm using that money to buy a rental property you know outright mhm and a and B that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nIn ... um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor\nAnd it's you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you\nYou know but you you put put a renter and how much they go out and you [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is I asked one factor I've got a bunch of it um non by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires management\nBy you or someone else and even if you have somebody else would you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return the ... minus the expenses as a return on investment\nAnd the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples\nHigher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent return I are are\nNot casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less than some of it okay but uh I our our total with the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the road to ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean ... you know even though I don't management and my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and so you have the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories all the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do that\nAnd I ask if our question I'm sure they might play point was a hundred thousand dollar house so with five hundred thousand [laughter]\nI have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each ... now so I don't I don't want 'em out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else started wanting to buy tree and leverage for fifty percent\nYeah well I don't ... you know I don't I mean I Know your answer there on a leveraging like\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ...
