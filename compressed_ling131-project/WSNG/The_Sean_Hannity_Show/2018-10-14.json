I'm just going back and forth\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're with us and Chuck is on the line and Pittsburgh\nI jog welcome to the Ramsey show [noise]\nI have thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife will have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in the past two and a half years good for you and what we've only got about two hundred new about what to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental property but we\nHave mortgages and another two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school either college ...\nAbout how the today show he's taken out ... and I stopped contributing to a four one K. and see if I've got a beginner babies to say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I feel like I'm not\nDoing everything I could do my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand ...\n... ... the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these rental property as we've been in the past couple of years and\nIf you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather put get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is their wings and land doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers whether it will be going to college tutor lecture years\nWell ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and the retirement fathers kids' college which urine or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt\nTo pay on your mortgage is yeah which is the ...\nAn indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nOr in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo it's a lot of our consumer that we should just have a a a three three maybe four month emergency farther than\nYep and then and then let's let them stop taking on student loans and clear 'em out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids\nIf there's money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn her house this time but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about ... we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay or the fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for what is the only one of the only twenty five thousand or write them a check like a year now and I was going to feel good and my son is still alive and pick out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental ... there was one in there somewhere to make them at work All right\nUh yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimums and take her college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\n... how about first we're getting back in the world okay or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right merge and she found is maybe step three and then babysit for his Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nThen we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house that's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order\nRight but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent\nWere taking care of college and then if it was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list as mortgages doctrine is that so there's still a prioritization even though ... says that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skip a tree or two and three I guess technically years given five or ...\nYeah yeah yeah and you have any skipped three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're drilling around the way we want you back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg,

ends alive for two teams [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um [noise] we did it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise]\nWe've had only one showing [noise] we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um [noise] what really struggling with here we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's well I'm Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then me and said that the Haitian because it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYeah so you're not in hiding out in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday a ... year up here in New York border but\nSo is your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yeah\nThe I mean three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting\nUm and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere they kinda\nSpecializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurt the things I'm Talking about\nYeah\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurting\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\n[noise] the higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... emailed her I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving or we need to get at where we have an hour drive to work we can't I Can't do it anymore you know okay I mean can you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like do we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll there is workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through them and they realize where it was I walked\nAway they were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here hold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the law you know\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do is go up there and looked at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it\nAnd that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that\nCan do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you\nFor the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and not a good potential buyers and it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area and they and they don't have the potential buyers for it you need it it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation\nI'm Sorry this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nYou know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time mhm and then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and simply\nWasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] that was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... they don't you don't have a heart from the beginning so I mean I'm\n... with your all's income

what we want to show then and then we had you know we kind of had to have\nA heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know and other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's a beach with a leg that kinda stuff with the income you've got and no debt\nEven do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so it was right man it's um you know you are your freed up such still have incredible um\nFamily memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the
