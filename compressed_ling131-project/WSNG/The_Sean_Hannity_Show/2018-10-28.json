[noise]\n\n\nThanks for joining us America we're glad\nWith us for like five five five Andy I'm Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by\nBecause there were the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska is not really much safer going by guys are\nYou have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs in ... in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a uh\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is on on on will be rented or on we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it up\nTo him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry ... journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your nonprofit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of\nA you know\nNeed to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that is from my fellow and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the turn of the good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more rock homeowner's insurance or if you're on the farm or something and\nA nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how to keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not you know you you're not stuck with land in a nonprofit that can get real sticky if you want to lose ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on their hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability especially with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal and for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to the state farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it\nIn my but you wouldn't want to buy their even if they did so you you said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much of this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in his shoes as but the main thing you want to ... do ... do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but um\nThey eat and\nThere are no agreements they keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that's your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that\nUh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff's effort in ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but uh I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts it keeps people honest\nRight it's like do you know you were you were walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his honor and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable there's still a level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for

unstable environment where there's job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years on or never happened I mean really lucky we've never been laid off and you have and that they get home pretty ... I mean within a couple of weeks\nSome couple of weeks to do something ... going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so [noise] uh\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws on money make over every step thing and this pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as what we all have and that's why we get out of\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth\nAnd then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step forward and do that first and a ... and then I Do it in a ...
