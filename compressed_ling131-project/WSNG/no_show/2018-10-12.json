subordinates\nNow imagine this you're working at any job and the boss comes down and talk to people who work for you under you and he's saying who do you think we ought to replace Larson with when we get rid of them that kind of thing the Washington Post the venerable Washington Post and left leaning\nSo they're never going to paint Trump enough favorable light reports\nPresident Trump talked recently was Jeff Sessions' own chief of staff\nAbout replacing sections as attorney general according to people who've been briefed on the conversation signaling the president remains keenly interested in getting rid of his top law enforcement official the conversation\nBetween ... a Trump President Trump and Matthew would occur as seemed somewhat nebulous it was not clear for example\nWhether would occur would take on an interim\nJob as attorney general or be nominated in a more permanent capacity\nOr how definitive the president's intentions were on a long list of the indignities that session has endured from his boss Trump's discussing replacing him with his very own top paid kind of stands out\nOn the other hand I I Want to give you a perspective on this because I'm not a legal expert enough certainly never served in office like this but Jeff Sessions has deeply disappointed almost every conservative I Know that I've had the opportunity to talk to in fact\nEvery time we take the show on the road Washington DC a wind up talking to members of Congress and their staff I asked them what the heck is up with Jeff Sessions\nHe comes into the job and

just what we needed this ... welcome to the program thanks for the John\nLarson thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of a president but frankly I I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we needed\nAbsolutely right I mean we were bound\nFor stagnation remember when people talked about two percent groping the new normal ... got or prevent yup it said it could never happen and we had a and I'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by you know really nice people but they just were up to the struggle of taking it on the bench\nNo they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he I mean we are getting rid of him eventually I mean now\nAt the end of the year uh but but this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nCats who have the right you know\nAnd the thing about that I'm Glad you mentioned Paul Ryan I couldn't agree more as a thing as the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I work on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president and I I I buy some ... we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all raised as Greece and all that I mean but we're looking after the people who have been left behind and I you know I'm\nI'm afraid that the kind of internationalist wing of the Republican Party\nAll in favor of you know free trade agreements and and all that\nThey had lost touch with them and and then the end\nYou know we've exceeded I'll tell you one thing about the book I debate politically inert and and they say workers kind of we're on that word and I say you know ... years to there used to be a Democratic Party that looked after ordinary people and that was not about party but you've given that up and you know what we ate their lunch\nWhen in fact doesn't seem ... outlook I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man working woman\nI keep wondering uh policies they adopt seemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of folks\nWho are just making a an average family income of I think now the mid sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well and and so there there it's the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nBy the way that's up from about fifty six thousand about five years back where we are doing pretty good I mean it wages are going up\nBut you know the the thing about the the the dams as they invested in identity politics we've had nothing to do with the concerns of a bit of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that's you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans than uh\nYou know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nMiss dramatically you just said suddenly made me think uh from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and ... sometimes\nIt's terminology that that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms and one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that for my audience the way you see it\nI Want to want to hear\nFrom the dams um you know you start by saying what's their race what their gender and so on\nAnd uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong race or the wrong grander that does to your your your there they're not terribly interested in you but mostly you know it means that they're obsessed with you know crazy old concerns like transgender bathrooms\nBicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich you are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the coal mine are looking for a job where I Know you've found the oil worker who's who's worried about about\nYou know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've gotten contested and frivolous concerns of\nThe people who got you know made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at\nGeorge Mason University School the school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed I I think you've spoken to some of these really important because when you become an elite\nIn other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house payment this month with a car payment or can we really afford to take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class\nAnd so like you say your ear concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to build in out in pretend that you care about that coal miner who's being who Hillary Clinton famously promise to put\nOut of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job for a new running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left is that where the the series justified is said and as where there was this big old union battled back in the Nineteen thirties and\nPete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I you know I thought this is great you know I Know which side the elite is on its author coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump so you know but you know talking about the elite I Love to you know I Confess\nI'm living inside the beltway I'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire\nTo be a traitor to my class 'cause I thought these relatives who are working on the assembly line in Detroit and I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently uh was telephone injustice what how does that figure into the whole equation the oil and\nYou know I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works Russia is before a judge reaches a verdict telephone up the you know the party Boston the communist days you'd say what should I Do\nRight so the ... you know using the telephone to determine what was going to be the result and I said you know in\nAmerica we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law in Russia we got too much but here we go to we got to search going on for the great Trump defendants and and you know mostly is is just kind of ordinary ... like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of\nThe lines of the FBI went had he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talk to the right to tell the Russian ambassador\nIs going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI and say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have every jot until from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into a into a process crime\nOr you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement as the FBI comes and talks to most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly where we are in the country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate to say and Frank 'cause I've had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents top sheriff's deputies you hate to start\nActing like when the police show up or the FBI shows have you say I should treat them like a treat the G are you if I was a a a an an occupant of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party any hails from George Mason university professor it's good to have you on the program we'll look forward to return\nPlace to tell the president who should be there and you heard a lot of that language of the last week well he may be qualified but he's not the right man for the job well the person who decides whether\nWhether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president the Senate can say this president you've nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her but in this case they had\nTo admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate so their job was to simply affirmed that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way and I mentioned this little uh it was amazing to watch this\nPresident Donald Trump sitting behind a resolute desk in the oval office\nToday and Kanye West sitting across the desk from him and Donald Trump listing for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes and I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man\nIs crazy now why did they think he's crazy\nBecause he's he's a successful black American whose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy all I'm find to be put on I'm OK with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit\nOf ... we had dinner\nI uh I I don't want to say that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people and I say you know first of all they had a letter to a lot of jobs by the fathers of the job and they say we'll give you more money for had more at\nAll and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute and AIDS\nAnd the previous just shot a\nPerfect shot right which is actually far harder it's going down when he\nMentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problem\nArea it's called the super bowl ...\nSo uh I think is a threat\nThat helps you\nCare to ...\nBut it has any\nThat gives you power in a way he's talking about the hat\nThe does keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan and he's saying this how gives you power and why you know\nAnd my mom's side how a lot of mail energy and my home and all of a marriage or family that I'm\nDoing all that\nWhere you know everyone\nMade me feel that the guy they can get all the time the black\nIt was just how it may still last Superman who made a super ... famously there are now\nThat's Kanye West saying that by putting that hat on he becomes a superhero I Know that a lot of the leftist said this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said do you do you find anything to object to\nHe says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that\nDamaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said to young women have more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and ... ... none of that\n... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say that programs that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them\nAnd you for having me on the guy looks out so you look around America no what\nAt that point I didn't believe that one out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was one I miss but\nI I dropped out went up because yeah he was sitting in the oval office ... was managed to drop a couple of swear words but his message\nWas all conservative and this is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who is both\nBlack American and successful it's sitting there in front of the president of the United states saying I admire what you've done I support what you've done I'm wearing this had\nIt turns into Superman and what in the world is wrong with that glad to have you with me at eight\nSix four three nine five to seven seven and we're talking about intellectual property rights again see ... going to join me next and you're listening to Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMine number two does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three\nPeople for poor please anything close to the restaurant\nMiddle seat with these stomach problem that's mine the euro flying\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called X Okrent pancreatic insufficient ... or ... even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBallooning stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still have ... because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about all your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...

Lars Larson dot com and I always promised to tell you if I have a dog in the fight so I have a dog in this fight because I occasionally by things on Amazon and I find that kind of convenient but his Amazon getting so big\nThat it could literally threaten our economy\nWill Michael Doherty joins me now CEO of the cyber education foundation and founder of the justice society he's also the author of the devil inside the beltway which we've talked about before Michael welcome back to the program\nOh I don't get it back with you there\nI'm doing very well so [noise] I like\nAmazon I Do business with them but I still do business with bricks and mortar stores a lot of other companies why do we now see Amazon and something so big it literally threatens our economy\nBecause little baby tigers are cute and when they get ground they'll kill ya okay [laughter] I'd rather for ... and ... and then a conspiracy theory Thursday step either I'm really by ... and so I you know look\n... isn't that interesting how he started calling an Amazon from the beginning it he pulls you and he does what we call loss leaders okay so we get so much money he loses money to undercut everybody else gains market control than\nYou know ... in close enough to slap in the face and now he owns the Washington Post so he can control the message ... media\nThere's ... ... all bad I mean obviously they have done\nPositive destruction they challenge things but this market dominance and this monopolistic behavior and and how brutal they are a too small business it is it's tough it's you know uh\nSo it it comes to an anti trust level I mean by a large I Love the efficiency that he's built in and I I have time also and I liked it challenges to you know you ... business has all but it's a little a few monopoly that'd be great no yeah\nWell actually I wouldn't be because you know Michael I've told I told my audience my metaphor is not as good as your baby tiger metaphor but I've told them you know if you said what I like to be the only talk show host in America no because having competition sharpens my game and I'm afraid I'd get lazy if I was the only game in town\nRight near the exactly right so why is the founding fathers decentralized\nPower is unified towers bad with human beings that just governments so we have Amazon who now it has\nThese ... these machines that listen to what they can understand what's going on at as data that is now wants to be the only clout for services provider for the military for a decade and the amount of\nA market steak corner and the Dutch they connect between those markets is terrifying when it's in the military and personal information and and and you know\nAt the newspaper and the media it's you know it's not about them it's turning into a true antitrust play and that's where it's going to go\nWhat has the FCC had those securities and Exchange Commission had anything to say about this because they certainly regulate my industry heavily they tell radio companies you can only own somebody radio stations and every market and we're not going to allow you to become dominant or it is it do not big enough yet to to trigger that\n... well ... you know when all anyone cares about the media today as Russia Russia Russia and they can't believe I'm Alice from President this is the price we pay because you know ... ... and listen to these big tech companies you know how fast these guys got huge it's like that movie alien where\nIt was a cute in the beginning and like ten minutes in the movie is eight feet tall so you know and he felt like wait a minute what happened here or kind of caught off guard but he take companies also learned from Microsoft when the government jumped on\nMicrosoft's there they were in Seattle is having a nice life and hear Tom's Europe in the U.S now everyone learns net and all and you know Amazon ... lobbying and they've got these\nBeautiful beautiful offices in DC and so it is so it is Google and so does Facebook and they're all breaking bread and getting a number but I I mean they're not down there protecting their turf in their ... or so [noise]\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation you know we have our problems in our discussions with our Facebook dinner Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it is ... and this is the other worry I have Michael that even if we say well they're too big I got two responses one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... now a little longer and they're about to go out of business would seemed but back\nWhen ... first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the market place and said\nYou don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store\nYou can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darned amazing to say\nUh you know I could see me I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day\nI understand that Amazon is on that on steroids but we were\nYou know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're going to wipe out the local general store will they didn't\nYou know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm I guarantee you they had an effect the second concern I have is this um that as\nWe're in a world market place now if we say Amazon we've got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big will China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service I mean a worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can give big but China can have a you know\nOr you know can have companies that are that big are we going to see the day where we've knocked down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to publishing the government part I\nI'm a little bit less less empathetic on because you know apple\nApple Amazon and the the rights and the constitutional belief and the human rights things that they just look the other way when they do businesses knows that Tories a lead me to believe that if we put our foot down they're not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away and that while they want to practice\nAnd do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so um if it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer because they have done a lot of really good innovation and that's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it\nDepends on the swings to find the other direction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas uh then we've got\nA problem at but ... you know these people have had so much money they do more profit margins more than the economy is the most country yup\nSo which do very careful about this and they're interacting with our regulatory because that regulatory and the Senate and the country is is pretty lousy ah we'll all care about them for some of the United states not education and that these regulations his lawyers with a you know law suits and they're\nThey're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough holding them accountable\nThat's why I think the antitrust ways the only place to do and I'm Wondering what to do the judicial system or not that will handle it off\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in a big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we can figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which\nSo far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance and overreach into cyber security medicine\nIn small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nI thank you sir good talking again\nOh laughed it off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state\nSo maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why um it is disqualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did and there's certainly no corroboration evidence\nA statements to back it up I'm ... but in theory what the accusation was something that it's just qualifying for drunk college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was was was supposed to be believable because people watched er

eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nOne of those things for me is the extent to which the Democratic party seems to have fallen to pieces they've lost over and over again they I Know they keep talking a good game about how the midterms are going to be there whether they're going to win in the midterms\nAnd then they pull off a stunt like the false accusations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and that\nIs starting to work against them so now they've decided to go rogue embracing violence of law ... behavior saying when they go high or when we when they go low will kick 'em a road runner McDaniel joins us now is chair of the Republican National committee it's good to have you back on the program\nIt's great to be here thanks for having me\nI Am thrilled to have you on the program I just want to know what is the best way for Republicans to respond to this when some of the top figures the Democratic party are actually\nOut openly inciting violence there doing it on camera there doing it quoted\nIn major media\nAnd so apparently they're not afraid to say when we don't get the result we want\nWe're we're going to go out and engage in violence and we're going to incite other people's to commit violence and all of this not too terribly long after\nCongress in ... college very nearly lost his life because a lefty decided to try and slaughter a group of Republicans on a baseball field do they know what they're doing and and do they understand how the American people are probably going to respond to this\nWell it's a very dangerous path that the Democrat leadership uh\nIs putting their party on and it's a dangerous for our country when you hear Eric Holder said when they go low kick 'em Cory Booker thank get in their face Maxine Waters saying get crowds around people something's gonna happen we already had\n... got shot we've already seen crowds on around Ted Cruz and chairs and there's an other cabinet members but this is not what we want for our\nCountry and I think Americans are looking at this thing is that Democrats not just regular average people this is the leaders of their party advocating for that and I think Hillary Clinton what she said it's so remarkable it's a size that shift in our democracy for her to say\nWe will not be civil unless we're in power what a threatening thing to say it is not that long unless we're in power\nRun it you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal with the four\nYear old and the surreal Iowa who's decided usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the captain crunch goes into the grocery bag is good and and it's the behavior you kind of expect from some kids who are poorly raised is not the kind\nOf behavior you expect from top members of the Democratic party saying we're gonna continue to be ... in civil I'm not sure which one it is probably an civil or until you give us power back\nAnd we're going to scream and yell and and probably hurt some people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we did it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry on a real active of violence that they're going to catch the blame on this\nI think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out and do angry division I mean with the Democrats have run out division for a long time but this is a new low for their party and it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that\nAre frightening lift these elites we've seen our senator having have security detail this is not something we want long term for our\nCountry and the Democrats need to be called out and I'm saying is that you are one of the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrats said that they don't like it they'll interrupt their family dinners or crate mopped around them what you should do is go out go get involved make a difference volunteers in it for the things you believe in\nBut we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our\nCountry and Democrat leaders need to be called out\nAt the voters are looking at this because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by them living in these terms the only way we bring back stability to Washington is if we reached jak the play but that they've been riding on his temper tantrum that eight that drive for two years now\nRun it can I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I'd put a bug in Europe and I I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you let's put it that way but I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do\nThe thing they should do which is go to democratic leaders leaders and say will you condemn these calls for violence now I compared the other night I was in Seattle for a form of a panel with\nA bunch of other tacos from one of my ... and somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have nice\nFamily friendly gatherings like the Tea Party that leave the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way they do and that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't\nYou know I as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right but because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters can we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president is is you know\nUnderstands that when you push the buttons the media if we saw some Republican stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they were holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks asking\nFor condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight and if if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that I think the media can only ... ignore it so long and then they'll have to acknowledge\nWell maybe when you need to go to Hillary Clinton and say you just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily as sort of the you know the go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should hold their feet to the fire\nI agree and and we just put together a video that was released today showing some of these ... that have been created a along with the words of these Democrat leaders we are definitely trying to\nHold Democrats accountable and you're right immediate needs to do it and we need to help push the media to act in a way that they don't always do because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over at ...\n... we're going to continue to set an example of civility we're going to continue to run on the issue is the results that have happened here this administration that has made life better for millions of Americans straight quite set up ... percent unemployment Claire millionaire jobs wages that so many great things are happening across this country and legal contrast\nThat with the resistance and the division and the destructive nature of the Democrat Party and hopefully on November sex the voters will reject this terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to the\nWind because you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various venues and he was he in generating gigantic crowds and I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down\nBecause of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble and and when the president responded I think there were a couple of times what it was a candidate he said throw that guy out or punch him or you know things like that\nAnd they were at the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence they they you know they will do that as you say if it's a Republican who does that are conservative who says something if I took to the air and said\nLet's go out to the streets and burns and things like antifa does which I Would never do a you know that that that would be condemned quickly\nSo if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own I think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it why aren't you asking the other side asked to folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown and the state where I broadcast\nAsk her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low let's kick up would you condemn that\nAt to this place and would be eating breakfast cereal in the room with the people were doing these procedures I mean this was an extraordinary thing the bodies were piled up by the way in the basement you know and the body for piled up in refrigerator same place where people have the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and that wasn't newsworthy that wasn't newsworthy in America you know I mean you know ...\n... talk ... who's written a book about gods now the two specific things and I think to conservatives these issues are familiar that kept the media way one it involved abortion although not abortion the way it is done legally in the right to go but done much to slaughter house and I don't think I'm overreaching no no\n... now is black yeah it's funny actually as funny somebody just real to me and said to me are you worried about being called racist I was working on this story for nearly two years before I realized with black you're just moving in I just you know I met him I mean I I've met him I Know\nI never noticed he was black and I met that might sound weird to people but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of his ... of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's a Seventy two year old doctor who delivered babies alive and then cut the next what scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yeah she is actually but I ... we had never thought of I mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of noticed that he was black you\nKnow sold me about this the most interesting thing I think about your ... shoes you got a chance to sit for three hours and talked to this man in person for you in the same room where you through\nGlass no I was in the same room and I I was in a while yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought we were going to have the ... the protection of the Plexiglas and in fact actually we're in this kind of coffee lounge\nWhere he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door about against ah against the wall and he pushed his chair opened his legs and kind of you know trapped me between his legs if you do what I mean I have my legs crossed\nAnd then continuously touched my my my knee as he would make points and it's on sorry once I'm terribly sorry\nAnd he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has this been less Lewis voice the soft voice he smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is serving three life sentences\nAnd talks about you know she was an awful shame he didn't get into the poetry class and and\nThat he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations 'cause he's just ... like this\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to music it's you know he really liked reading and haven't been able to read because he's been so busy all these years\nBut it getting to read true crime which he really enjoys I mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah 'cause he was sort of talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I started listening to ... you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brand free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name and\nI Love ... by the way the Belgian crude or who died I bet a lot of your listeners would know having a big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself to death but he had this incredible voice I'm an ... looking at me think what's the name what's that song what's the name of that song the one the famous one and\nI'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at the ... and then of course I say you know kind of through clenched teeth Nicki the ... and then he leans right in Maine goes I mean the key to a\nAnd start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like are you serious is this what's happening right now yeah so\nThat was the guy has no sense of what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have if you just generically told the story I mean left out the door but just said he murdered a couple of ... does anyone know for certain how many babies were put to death by by having their spines Nicolas a pair of shoes one according\nTo the grand jury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stopped with this hurt evidence they said ... it was not and that is why exactly as you said in your introduction it is very safe to say he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne gave the Ted Bundy the Saudi I cannot all of them combined come nowhere near that\nSo this guy and you know the only reason he's not on the list of the most prolific serial killers in America is the only reason is because you'd have to acknowledge the humanity of those children\nAnd that is something that we want to do we want to make sure he gets the title because these were human beings I've seen the photographs of them I can tell you these are these are children who world will never no no and we need to acknowledge them and be a you know be a witness to the fact that they lived and

also based on on the government policy of ... of foreign policy of saying okay we need to put the sanctions on against Iran which does what it means there's less soil and again this isn't a judgment

think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and\nAnd talk you out and do what they have\nBeen able to because they basically are now the I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about the you know the controller inside the OPEC member nations it's Saudis and so\nWe're talking about them increasing you know and and uh or in their case they had been up to now decreasing their output 'em\nAnd they do that because they know the rising a production rate here in the U.S\nIs threatening to them [noise] and so they want to ah\nBasically slow production to control the costs they do that and the global costs start drive by the way another\nBenefit to greater domestic production because [noise] when when we get to the point that we are producing as much as we consume every day as a nation than you\nWill you will look at the dynamics of a market and the Saudis and Iran\nAnd anyone else but I don't have that behind the story we brought you last week because of a President Trump mhm uh they're opening up the spigot yes and exactly in Saudi Arabia has said which is what he wanted them to do and and and that's\nYou know for right now because the way what we're producing and how much we're producing ah we're not at that\nRate of Eighteen to Nineteen million barrels a day in production when we get there that's another case to be made ramping up production and more on our way even though in the last three weeks we become the ... the world's\nLeading introduce or of crude oil right um but but at a vote that that didn't really get

the in the free market it's not going to work that way we're going to talk with Tom hill after\nThe bottom of the hour get caught up a tropical storm Michael right now you're forecasts Roger you buy on the trucks\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia most of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today\nAs well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so only about two to four inches of rain however\nTropical systems that are real good at bringing out the sponge and bringing down that moisture and so\nThat's what I'm concerned about because two to three inches of rain falling in the areas near Fayetteville up the Raleigh up the Wilson that area that whole area from uh Florence up the Fayetteville is is low lying area and easily\nUh because of Florence itself\nCould topple more trees more flooding and then the flash flooding is going to be more in line in line with Raleigh\nAnd um and back right where you're at the base of the foothills that that take you back up into the smoky and that's where you're going to have water that's falling and it's going to be coming down from Anderson and Greenwood Spartanburg\nUh Greenville North Carolina all of that's going to be draining down into those lower areas um between Raleigh in Fayetteville and that's that's the big concern that I have and and that's going to be a broad area\nNow inch rise a lot of areas are going to get a on the west side of Ninety five back up to eighty five which comes out of Charlotte and around by forty that's up near term that area it could be picking up five\nInches of rain there'll be some isolated spots running up through Raleigh and so forth could pick up as much as eight inches of rain but we've already had a few places pick up two to four to five inches afraid Atlanta\nOr you wouldn't think but Elana is already over a two point eight inches of rain from this round so\nAnd they're they're out of the targets on and so when you start to come into to Charlotte and the the path of this storm what we're looking at is going to take it from where it is now between Augusta and Colombia\nAnd by the time we make it to the middle of the day it'll be south of Charlotte and in between Charlotte and ah Wilmington then it'll be between Raleigh by afternoon and tonight this thing is going to be near a\nNorth folk and the Hamptons or Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach and uh as I pointed out before um\nHampton Roads is sea level or in some places below sea level a it's kind of like the New Orleans of ah the east coast and and that area there's neighborhoods there that just are\nBorderline flooding all the time and so when this hits that area they're going to have some very serious flooding issues as well and so this is a this is a big storm I mean you can throw in on the side or the the strong winds forty mile an hour\nWinds let's say forty five mile an hour a wins sustained or go see the way that can be toppling trees because the ground is saturated you can throw in a few tornadoes just for fun and um whether they even stronger isolated wins and\nUm but this is a storm to be reckoned with a even including um see rise along the outer banks not counting or\nA high tide of two to four feet right from okra coke to duck and so while it all points of flooding and power outages with the major two issues that we have to deal with with a few isolated scary moments from tornadoes\nRight or were they are in high tide there in Florida uh as as Michael came ashore yesterday\n[noise] you know I'm not sure I didn't check that\nHeard that but I did not follow up on that someone had said that it it it makes it worse than it was\nYou know I'm not sure I didn't check that\nI heard that but I I did not follow up on that someone had said that it it it makes it worse than it was in a way that it was high tide at that at that point but I I don't know about that timing of that held that was kind of early in the day and and I don't know I I'm not sure if that was the ...\nMy thought was that it was coming off high tide and ...\nAnd and if you if you noticed in the last two hours everything got real intense in the last hour yeah yeah actually the very last one hour like we talked about everything just went boy it's getting bad fast yeah\nI'm I noticed that a ... a shout out to one great meteorologist I'm Stephanie was staying in a port St John\nAnd that's where her crew in our team was and and each one of the reporters is responsible for as cheap as the met over the team is responsible for their safety [noise] but she would apparently they weren't staying at a hotel they were staying with some kind of family or maybe a bed and breakfast or something like that\nAnd they couldn't get them to evacuate wow and so and so you mentioned you mentioned it earlier in the beginning of the show that that\nYou know the ah can tore made the suggestion you don't get the heck out of here and right and get aware because we know where this is going to land and you also mentioned that the guidance showed five days out that [noise] wow it it nailed it yeah yeah for an ass\nRight down the path that half of where it was going to where it was possibly going to hit at five days out and Florence was two miles off the target at five days out ... that\nOnly just unheard of yeah Florence and and and all of us meteorologist got goose bumps only heard this yeah\nAnd but there's there's there's some things that are going on in giant data processing when it comes to our\nModels and our satellite imagery which has changed the way we forecast hurricanes water vapor imagery which allows us to see the exact point where the center is of rotation and be able to see\nThe wind flow at different levels and we have some computer models in the mid west the forecast\nOver in Eighteen hour period of time\nWhere there are going to be outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and potentially knowing the conditions we can tell if it's just going to be a thunderstorm if we have all the conditions favorable for tornadoes and and these models will pinpoint some things and I recall\nMay ninth two thousand sixteen and pinpointed a little area\nI'm up near Duncan, Oklahoma and sure enough\nA that was five or six hours out\nA thunderstorm developed right in that little area continue to grow and turned into what was a became what was called the when he would tornado or that came rolling across interstate thirty five right a south appalls valley um and so the accuracy justice downs me\nHis guinea and like ... like over the last the accuracy now compared to ten or Fifteen Years ago\nSeven ... seven all over the last ... last seven years on ah the H H triple our model is what we call it that was an experimental model\nAnd that was experimental seven years ago even five years ago but as we started to use it because they put it out and let all of his shoes it we realized and grew incompetence of that model being crushing only accurate and and so you see a lot of TV stations with the\nWeather models that are called future cast and so forth ... there's a handful of private companies IBM included the owns the weather company\nOr not the weather channel they actually have their own proprietary model accuweather has its own proprietary model enterprise ah barons has its own proprietary models and then of course there's the government models and\nAnd I don't know how much they they they steal from each other's data information to own it down to where it's at but we're getting ... very very accurate in being able to forecast little whirl pools in the atmosphere which creates circulation lift and the potential for storms while\nAlways an odd thing and\nAnd just amazing to watch it happened but again we go back to you know the basis of of why people do what they do and and why meteorologist or a ... like you mentioned earlier and yesterday on talking about the you know the the idea of being able to warn people\nAnd if we can learn and the technology gets better than obviously in ...\nYesterday I was talking about the you know the the idea of being able to warn people and if we can learn and the technology gets better than obviously in future storms there is a greater warning which means a greater survive ability\nOf those storms so Tom we just want to thank you somebody as thank 'em and you answered all my questions I got so many so many things here ah yeah yeah it's all about us we had really you know\nBut ... if you knew that coming into this one [laughter]\nOh they told you that [laughter] but uh you

telling brag about the nights we all spent it at parents have aunts that handled all but that's another story so yeah yeah yeah but ... you know lenders a legendary athlete at hand at all\nThe legendary I knew that without you know I Know this is just on my list in a good good good to talk to you this morning now the French ... students in who's ... and I've talked to him over the years um you've got family don't have a problem with something Fred did regarding a\nA more a political angle here what's up with that\nBut I've noticed that you know he was waiting for these isn't being an economist\nWhich you know is it is looking at what's happening either in Connecticut or or or around the globe and how it affects Connecticut economically ... new to politics and he ... you know you're busy with your article in the summer about\nHow uh you know ... when we were talking about whether it was toward a toll and the whole thing about while you're only think coal has got to be good\nBut there's no faster so this is going to come in or did you look at what are what are the numbers were there are no numbers I met with the commissioner of yesterday he must have numbers they're still current Europe this whole thing so how does that it works but he took that position\nAnd with the governor\nOr he was ... what will ... billion dollars more than a governor Ralph and ... got a little cooler forward which put U.S born that\nHe never comment that ... was put on some things and not others most recently he when you do on a ...\nAnd that's just not his all his role our number ... blind it is to work ... who's in control of the governor's mansion blind to control the legislature are talking about the economy when ... when we're more\nThis went on when when I'm politics or are we going to know how you feel about President Trump when do you do\nNegatively on President Trump or a almost a\nA attacking members as the person that's not his job and I'm concerned when a university that supposed to be a political a skirt professors start winning and losing their titles get censored\nAnd their titles after the world to weigh on where you know politics that's just not the right thing to do\nSo I just wanted to let him do that a suburb of kidney backed up ... years ago five years ago now actually a Buddhist and scored a letter to him about\nHis political slant any kind of backed off but I noticed that a lot more complicated to let them know that it's not going without some degree of scrutiny\nSenator I got a question I Want to ask you a I've been wanting to ask you this for a long time\nBecause uh you are very very well respected no question about it or we don't agree all the time but uh if you are a everybody respects you would you ever run for governor\n[laughter] thought no I don't think so and the reason is is that you know God Bless these guys were wedding or a statewide office it's awful lot of time that you know I've got my time in Hartford and I love the state senator a\nI have other business interests obligation to my family um my dad passed away several years ago and you know I help with my mom so I've got a family obligations\nAre that's number one to my kids my grandkids now\nAnd uh you know when you run for governor [noise]\nUh you got to take a full year out of your life but\nThen the next ... years is is twenty four hours dedication and if I Can't make that you did it to the state I don't think it's fair for me to watch it and that's the\nSort of deliberation I with with my family a year and a half ago\nAnd it just wasn't something that I think uh fortunately they sense as much as I'd love to do it um it was something that uh it was a family decision and it just was it in the cards so I really enjoy the states that are like district I Love my child's um and so\nI I passed on that that was the ... they say\nIn politics a tiny picks you you don't take it and uh when it was an open seat I Would have been the best kind of thing but it just didn't play outright\nFinally once again the Frank ... thing you know a lot of people would hear you and they say well you know friend is a resident of the state and he may have a vested interest so let me just clarify your I assume on the front costs\nYou're not saying that he doesn't have a right to express his opinion but there are certain things that should be said not said\nWithout your title as a university professor or university endless from Yukon you know Joe blow is a resident of infield is different than you know Joe blow as the ranking professor of economics at the University of Connecticut that's essentially what you're saying correct\nCorrect I mean if if you work your way in the ... you had a First Amendment rewrite the say anything you want but I think when he uh has the title that they're calling about I think he has to talk about the\nEconomy and economic and not put the political slant ... with this title that he could write all the ... as someone who lives in this state is anybody ...\nWhat I find is either a ... a couple of the conversations by virtue of the press statements or any ... who works in art that is a tremendous\nUh discovered a way in every other time of that and that's what gives me pause or your your your ... title he has to be a poet according to talk about the facts and figures without\nHurting a color commentary on out\nSo you will not ... have you you've not spoken directly to him about this have you\nKnow when you\nWere talking a but I ... when they're writing as a record of maybe the lawyers\nAnd lawyers as you're on the billable hours out in writing lab you're right\nYou're right [noise] well I'll tell you the or what you were brought to the to the program a ever since you've\nBeen there it's it's remarkable and you know what I like about you is that you will call us you know I think it's it's great you know we call we want to call and we do this all the time that's\nOur job part of our job but you have that that certain something that I'll tell you something right now it means a lot to us that you would call us and want to talk about a certain subject and uh I just wanted you to know it\nWell I appreciate it because they think you're going to be involved in any way they get the ... get the story that goes as does provide your listeners that support\nMullin thanks thanks for joining us and have a wonderful weekend land thank you\nYou too can talk yet by ...\nBy to okay you go up to twenty eight minutes after the hour of or he is he really is yeah\nYeah one of the vast he's accessible and ... that's the word ... you can and Brad Will you know I have you know you you and I both know that there are people of both parties that will come on shows like this and and others around the state and then there are some and I've dealt with the press people up at the Capitol there are some that\nThey just refuse to ... that they won't do alive interviewer they're afraid to be challenged so absolutely and I know a lot of people in ... well I Know a lot of people are like land and other people we have on them now lives in the dome I Know but like you said the for those of us who do something like we do in this business\nIs the the initial praises somebody who will come on and take the question that's right\nYeah okay my friends are coming up to a seven thirty if any of you have anything that you would like to uh\nGive belong to us please do one eight eight eight five seven four to seven to three I mentioned earlier this morning the Connecticut tax dollars are have been spent on a few things then there's another one or the New Haven tennis\nTournaments and some people are concerned about that\nBut uh as you know a a to Paul that a New Haven tennis tournament is going down anyway yeah uh there are a lot of people that are well they just don't have the don't have the money\nSix hundred thousand dollars or and then another two hundred and fifty thousand yet to your point ball we had we saw attendance figures over a hundred thousand dollars one pilot Penn was the sponsor from I think Ninety eight to about two thousand and ten\n... Shaw put his heart and soul into that and yeah it was a major event and the tennis world yeah\nIt drew it drew great crowd it was a great economic boost to the city of New Haven and all the all the towns surrounding it\nRestaurants were full hotels were full people were shopping in our stores which made sense but we we don't see that today and I don't know that that's any fault the organizers I think that we we just have changing times in Connecticut they the event does not attract\nA top players any more um you know we're looking at at at millions of dollars of investments and still spending hundreds of thousands as this deal that was cooked a number of years ago winds down\nFor something that just isn't working so so what do you do I mean sometimes you have to have to fish or cut bait rate and you know uh and I think we may be at a point where this is something that that the that the state of Connecticut has to look at and say you know this is not something that we should continue to invest in anymore\nGiven on all of the other struggles that we have with respect to our state budget\nAnd deficits and an excessive bonding\nOr my my colleague and friend lent Santos spoke just a moment ago um about you know over a billion dollars in New bonding under them away administration\nWhen does it stop and when do we went to the bonding commission take responsibility for really looking at these things that were bonding and saying is this a good investment because that's really what bonding is for the people at the state of Connecticut and the use of our tax dollars is what is this a good investment for the people\nAnd I think we can very clearly argue that there have been some really really bad decisions with respect to\nA with respect to bonding or under the more administration and\nAnd this I unfortunately I I I think is part of that and nothing against tennis I don't follow the sport myself I'm you know but I think it's time for us to really ah really take a closer look at what's going on with the the tennis center there in New haven and\nI certainly don't see myself in the position that I Would support any additional funding for ah for something that is not not working just doesn't work\nSenator just thinking about this whole thing\nYou know we have got a huge problem in Connecticut we all know that we've got a huge tax problem and we just keep taxing untaxed singing taxing why can't we set up a commission\nThat looks and all of these different plans before we do anything before we say yes why can't we do that\nWell Brad that's a great question and I think that ... that it goes back to quite honestly\nWhat what the actual responsibility of a of a if we're looking at you know we have to we'd actually at the chalk that up a little bit because some of the money comes from from bonding some of that comes from a from other other prophecies through the budget but if we look specifically at at bonding again because that's really where we see the biggest\nUse and and spending of tax dollars right outside of the things that\nWere required to pay for for supporting programs that the government because there's a difference obviously right one is investments and\nAnd and rebuilding and helping to to a move\nYou know economic things for the other supporting the the function of the government so\nWhen we look at bonding ate the bonding commission which is made up of the governor the the treasure members of the legislature other members of the governors cabinet they have the responsibility right there to act responsibly and they've demonstrated\nYou know we ran I spoke to you about this a couple of times ago about right when when when the treasure ... was up for a approving the ah that that big bonding package um and and she said with respect to the ten million dollar Saudi untold she said\nWell I'm not going to vote well you don't want your an elected official you ... you can't sit in the meeting and say you're just not going to vote you don't have an opinion picked aside get on it either way and stand behind it\nAnd she stood there as a member of the governors cabinet and said\nWhy don't agree with ten spending ten million dollars I don't think it's necessary but I'm just not going to vote on it I mean what what kind of silliness is that and this speaks to\nSpeaks to a part of the way the that the bond bonding commission is active for for the eight years that that the governor has been in office and and it's time to change that it's time to change that and we have the opportunity to do that coming up uh I think in twenty six days and\nUh but that's where the responsibility lies with all those ... billion dollars a new bonding over over the last eight years that's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous\nIn centers in the right in in in the the the case that we're looking at here with the Connecticut Open is just one aspect of that illustrates the fact of the state is\nSo you know people could say over extended itself even some of these private enterprises that should be figuring out ways and brand and I were talking about this early this morning private enterprises ... cities and towns who would love to get a little smidgen them stay money when they need to be a they need to be figuring out\nWays they could do that themselves listen thank you so much for calling us or you know we'll keep an eye on is Connecticut to a Connecticut Open deal I Know the state or the state funding foreign is supposed to run out and twenty twenty but we'll\nGet an ion yeah great thanks again guys

camera by Mitch Davis and that's your on this date uptick\nThrough to the election in November what does this all about I Wonder let's find out Adrian good morning\nOr good morning Brett how are you\nAnd uh my uh my partner I Know that you know him or you or you have a\nMet him before all Sally we've small for morning from good morning ... well you know you say we we we all saw what happened here with the cabin off of the fight to confirmation controversy the the anonymous letter that was held onto the wasn't shared with with the White House or or or what Chuck Grassley\nAfter after we've had a few days to die you digest says what are your feelings on this\nWell let me start with really just one thing and just one can pull correction breath it's like double you ca we know there's a lot of confusion\nOh yes yes yes [laughter] All right\nAnd uh [noise] so I I Do want to start by saying first of all what what's the herd and in this instance isn't something\nThat all that unusual when you consider that about one out of five American women and one and about Seventy one men have been either the victim of an attempt it or completed sexual assault in their lifetime and an eight out of ten of those cases\nAre those the victim knew their their attacker\nAnd of course we saw that it's an issue that impacts across\nAll races genders ages socio economic status\nIf it's epidemic and I think what we really saw in the sense that it's part of the reason that many of the victims suffer in silence for so long feelings of guilt feeling of food and in this case\nI read victimization of the victim a mockery of the victim um with with no shouldn't win\nA deep attempt to discover even what the what the facts are ... that's exactly what what I feel a played out recently I in the latest\nUm [noise] it it just feels like an assault again on on women and again it's the reason for suffering and fire\nAdrian then what what you are saying that no matter how it goes okay innocence okay and are innocence but in something like this because a woman's involved then automatically guilty right\nIs that what you're saying I have\nTo be heard I I really think that women have to be to be heard\nAnd I think that you have to start with the print something on a belief and then if you want to be able to substantiate on either side of it\nGuilt or innocence as you say then all the facts\nAre are are going to have to be brought forward I mean let's think about that that if someone are either you or I you know to you know every single detail of something from Thirty years ago thirty five thirty seven years ago maybe are not able to articulate\nEvery tiny detail but it's something traumatic or horrendous happened to you you certainly will remember that\nA dream here's where I think this whole thing went All right I think when a Dianne Feinstein being the ranking Democrat on the committee\nWhen she would win this letter was needed to her by Dr Ford and the sensibly Dr Ford from what I read and understand wanting to remain anonymous here I guess that's\nThat was how it was explained [noise]\nThe minute I heard that and they're\nMaine anonymous here I guess that's that was how it was explained [noise]\nThe minute I heard that and there have been varying lengths of time was it a month was it six weeks was an eight weeks I think we ran into a problem here when she didn't share this\nImmediately with chairman gradually and then he might have gone to the White House now they eventually found out about it and may have given the White House\nYou know time to say well we got a Yankee nominee which has happened before Harriet Miers God yang from George W. Bush and all this\nSo I guess my point your Adrian is I think the political process here poisoned this whole thing because you know had both sides known about this and this is not being brought on sort of at the last minute you would have had a lot more breathing time to perhaps\nGiuliani even under investigation more than a week or so what are your feelings on that\nWell certainly you know like I can certainly understand some political and your point\nBut I think beyond that at once something is\nIs that covered ah why was such a rush to judgment it it's hard to really understand or know what someone's intentions or intent might be a sometimes and how that may or may not have been folded\nWhat conversations took place cetera but the point is that once it was ... the ...\nAre ... due diligence would have been you've got to have an exhaustive invested ... here and you've got to be sure\nWe're putting someone on the Supreme Court highest court in the ... are putting someone on the court that's going to be\nThere for decades could could very easily and it's going to alter the decision that this was an important appointment and I would have preferred to be more than ... not\nDid you want to lay this till after the midterm elections\nComing up it's not about mid term election\nThen you don't think it was about ... elections pardon\nYou don't you definitely don't think it's about mid term elections\nIt's not about mid term elections now you're talking about a political\nBecause it is a political fight it is it's a political it's a political fight but this is where things when you talk about where they went awry\nTo people's lives as this woman's life is not a woman who they'll report getting death threats like has been altered\nFor ever\nThe consequences of all of that will reverberate and be more deeply held\nBy her\nFat so for me to understand mid term election but I'm not talking about at this moment ... a political prop I'm Talking about human dignity and read back and what's wrong\nCa dreams Paul again I agree with what yours I think your base premise is the correct one However I'm just going to say this because I think and you probably hear people say there's two\nI think your basic premise is bull's eye one hundred on one or present on but I think that the overriding aspect to this I think politics ruled in the end I don't think there's been a question of head I don't think it's great I don't think in the end Adrian really\nThat a lot of people who were pushing a the concern for a doctor for and I really don't think ... you and I know how this game is played in the end if somebody is useful to one side or the other you and I both know they are\nAbsolutely I'm not going to deny that\nBut I also want to talk with you again for me and that's the person for whom I can speak for me that is just where I Choose to be stuck\nOn the dignity of that in higher process sort of turned into this that fight show and you know you've got a a a Saturday Night live\nA that was that was parity yet it was terrible yeah\nThere are certain things you know a dreamy are certain things that you don't need comedy about and that's one of them\nAnd we've got we've got our leader you know you hear him mocking this woman so it it home absolutely up a committed for some political\nAnd so it is absolutely a committed her some political\nFights not the underlying issue\nWomen and girls are not marked for and screaming to the their long about a political ... they are about ... like that happen to women and girls and from that and that's really what we want to keep our daughter\nAnd a ... at least hopefully Adrian we can learn something about this and move on\nSay I'm Glad that you really had the courage to call us and I made that from the bottom of my heart and uh that is the kind of person that you are and I want you to to go away with that\nAh we're giving a family retailer or the year award to quarter farms in Ellington and we're giving our retailer year award to tile America in New haven and so we do that around a lunch in that takes place at the national theatre in Hartford on not\nThis year will be held October seventeenth next Wednesday from eleven thirty two about two o'clock and where we provide 'em they'll get the presentations and folks up some some lunch and then they go back to work\nNow are you going to have some uh ... candidates stopped by\nWe are I'm In the ... in our morning session which begins at ten o'clock from ten to eleven thirty we have scheduled on all three of the laboratory all candidates that are\nWaiting in the polls which would be you know of course I'm a ... step and asking Mr Lamont and Mr agreeable we'll all be there or they're going to come at a separate times they won't all be together\nUm one will be there can't about ten thirty and then following all it's about eleven thirty or when we finished or very excited about that I think we're the only association this date that can get all three of them that their um a lunch in at the same time so\nI'm we're hoping that um will get some insight into what their thoughts are for not only are you know the rest of the campaign for what they\nAre vision or Connecticut to look like under their leadership is governor so one of those three is going to be the next governor of the state and we're really excited that they're going to be able to talk to our members\n[noise] Tim on a wider a scope here I'm One of the retailers now saying to you as head of the retail merchants association regarding the economy and how things are looking for them as God when you get close to the holiday season once again [noise]\nUh right yeah the holiday season is right around the corner it's hard to believe 'em but I you know I think I'm there over all they're doing much better than they were of a year or so or two years ago I I think it depends on the\nCategory of retailer that you're talking to some of them are I'm doing a little bit better than others I think the presence of the online um there's you know online sales is still a factor and they're still ... retailers are still trying to you know come to come you know to compete against that\nBut overall I think with the improvement of the economy on nationally any permanent economy in the state um there's they're doing a little bit better and I think they're all it's geared up for a strong um holiday season so you know we we know there'll be ready for that\nAnd we're hoping that consumer confidence remains you know on the rise in books will have um you know we'll get out and do their shopping locally here in Connecticut\nTim uh I Would sink think so I I Would think that are under the situation that we all are in here in Connecticut that are these are merchants these retailers would need some relief or you go everywhere people talk taxes\nThey're going to increase here they're going to increase their so what is this going to do in the future to ah to these merchants\nYeah well that's a really good point bread I mean particularly the sales tax increase we were really not like sit increasing the sales tax that were put us at\nYou know a much more a competitive disadvantage from our neighbors are I'm In the in the north and and and a little bit in the in even in New York so we would like to see the sales tax uh remain\nThe same if not um even lowered if it's possible to make us more competitive because you know could soon\nAh remain the same if not um even lower it if it's possible to make us more competitive because you know consumers even though the economy is doing you know better and people are\nIn the stock market with all this week the stock market was up and down a little bit but overall the market's been doing great and\nI'm folks are I'm feeling better they are still you know price driven in their purchasing and so you know if there's a way that they're going to try to find the best value in the price\nYou increase the sales tax that's kind of discouraging depressed some um some consumers so we certainly would want to stay away from that era the retailers through that may not often get recognized as they are businesses too so they pay you know the same you know corporate taxes they pay local property taxes um\nYou know they have to pay pay a unemployment taxes they pay into the or\nNo to that system as well so the variety of taxes that hit a general business that you usually think of also hit the retail business so we have you know a couple of things that we have to be mindful of um you know not just the sales tax but those other business taxes as well\nTim um [noise] what are your thoughts are what are you hearing from retailers\nRegarding the ongoing or to ... the behemoth here in in ... and it's all over the world all over the country but you know Amazon seems to be the the big elephant in the rain here as they continue to grow and grow and grow and you know now there's talk and and again\nYou know I Know Amazon does have fulfillment centers in the state but I Know there's talk now it is some rumblings in Congress about well you know\nUh you know do we look into regulating them are they getting too big and I know there is some retail merchants of that that that did survive quite nicely and others that have problems when are you hearing from your members about how they're battling all this on line or all this online commerce\n[noise] well there's no doubt that the explosion of on line a commerce has a really affect the way I'm a main street traditional retailer operates and so what I'm hearing from them is\nThat it's been a big challenge but what we don't hear from them and because there are hard at work about it is they're they're dealing with that challenge or taken on that challenge there\nThey themselves to small slowly by slowly\nOn our building their own online presence 'em to compete because now their customers not just in ah the four corners of Connecticut put their anywhere they could they could be in any state\nI'm at any time and so they have to compete against that online presence and is it a challenge for them you know absolutely and now we did get a good ... a victory this uh uh earlier this spring with the Supreme Court decision\nNot that as a central you going to force all online retailers purely online retailers\nTo now collecting rummage sales tax or two for transactions that took place in Connecticut\nSo that'll help a lot that'll that'll um over time um that will even in the level the playing field so that if I buy a pair of shoes\nFrom an online retailer I have to pay Connecticut sales tax just as if I went into a store and bought\nThat sales tax and we've been arguing for that for you know Twenty years and finally just U.S Supreme court you know listen to our case so that will help but in the short term the retailers that I talked to are concerned about the uh the online presence of of a big online us uh stores\nUm but they're also competitive and so they're competing with them they are trying their building their own Web sites and\nAnd their ... their own e commerce or to compete there are resilient bunch a the retail industry there's so much that they can take 'em in and fight that they can you know when I'm In now again with the Supreme Court decision\nIn our favor um that's gonna that's gonna help them in the long term but certainly in the short term they need things like you know the lower sales tax rate than eat things like a friendly businesses are that they need things like you know having um\n[noise] you know government make a help uh businesses succeed they need um things like you know businesses like CBS the decision to keep at night in Connecticut but those are really important things for a\nMain street retailers because there are jobs that are created in ... and that means if there's jobs that means there's consumers that'll go in and shop for stores shop in our stores\nJim failing resident a Connecticut retailers merchants association and certainly a a tremendous organization but still a gym we have got a long road ahead of us we have got to be able to lower taxes\nWe have got to be able to make it easier\nGot a long road ahead of us we have got to be able to lower taxes\nWe got to be able to make it easier in Connecticut has had this problem now for a long long time and the I Am one that feels that this is a next election is going to be probably one of the most important that we've had in a long time\n[noise] or certainly can't argue with you there Brad there there's a critically important in a lecture we're going to have a governor a we're we still have a budgetary issues that challenges\nThat we face and it's really important that the legislature in the new governor um are are working together to come up with solutions and that will help the business community because we need\nNow more than ever to stabilize um our our economy in the sense that we don't take any more structured blows\nTo the business community they need to know that there's some predictability and that your son\nA change in attitude in terms of how um government is going to is going to deal with this is like that's really critical and I know my friend that she be IHL Brennan on talks about that a lot which is you need this environmental change those attitudes will change\nAbout how I'm In the legislature in how the governor's office you know deals with business and um this\nWho were running or not\nWith just to\nThen my\n\n...\nNa na

none of that creates a one\nJob for African Americans not one job but they beat that drum why why do they beat that drum\nYou're listening to your healthy radio addiction your reaction to Trump

reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the\nThe fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nBut they can't pay her to make me feel that the guy that he didn't get to see my down all the time like\nThat was it was something about ... put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made of Superman that was not taught favorite superhero [noise] and you made a Superman case for me [noise]\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nAll said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that uh the Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose and a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played them every night\nAnd every day well all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time\nIt doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we now he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of ...\nYou said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course there's a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nIn a ... someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion I mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base\nHillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true ... ... do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance economy I brought up let's keep listening to ... foot with him\nAnd his father having to have someone to help him and the guy them and then he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nGo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative is you want to support Donald Trump that is your business but as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be on and on human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I'll go okay\nHe knows more than all the diplomat and all the people voted their lives to this well\nI mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did they never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses X. twin to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit I'm In the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans\nFlip the script this is a unconventional move and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go away\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAbsolutely I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people who disrupt gearing up about normally mild mannered senators Cory Booker probably proclaim I'm breaking the rules by releasing confidential information during the hearing\nAnd then you see a senators being assaulted at airports run out of restaurants with their spouses\nAnd just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a a ... college should Rand Paul could probably\nJust a part of this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence ... Eric Holder did which is a dangerous that I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all you\nKnow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress\nUnites with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United it's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[noise] what was you know war the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump is now Puerto two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a church for this on attractive or to say the least\nThis is the driving them I think to a church that is a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was a interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenger the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails them are on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if he or importantly see can meet those qualifications\n\nYour reaction to that [noise]\nThey they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion ... he's running for the Democratic nomination for president twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of a mob rule\nAnd senator what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the midterms may you heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n[noise] well I think Ted's and that's in good shape ... latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout\nWe know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won in twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see down there and the turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said while he would have voted for a cabin all but I'm the truth is\nIf you watch the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on the ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator\nTo discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack the incentive\nTo me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\n... pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the site on the letter and then they send it to the FBI after the initial um the initial hearing than it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's\nBackground investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee so much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um those cats or a doctor Ford's lawyer although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interests very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're going to we're going to get to the bottom of this or are they ... they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a a success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nI I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that\nNames when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages\nBy the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nGlass there's nothing like an FBI investigation on really trace what happened who did it and someone's lying someone dying here\n[laughter] well I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction the federal district whether a federal crime was committed here\nUh I'm I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps through and that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been a federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next to you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much in Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley things she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time or I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think uh\nUh that it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh\nTo the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who doesn't support either Gorsuch or a foreign capital or some of the other Democrats on the ballot ask\nJill McCaskill exactly in Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and\nI just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and no one ever think that we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump as as I was in there\nThe VA aid and attendance program can provide elderly veterans with

register for Hillary Clinton in the last election this is a woman who works in public ... they give ... manic interviews where they can't keep their facts straight\nAnd we're supposed to believe they are the mouth pieces of political was\nBut he only bring home and takes it as kind of show this Trump yeah had my vote but now\nThere was that [noise]\nOh violation Irish ... come around you're saying but why is one person stable and the other unstable unacceptable you shouldn't listen to them diamond and still coming in moments Randy in Florida you wanted to say what\nI heard a story ... ... pound bag and it fits the situation\nIt starts with a question have you ever seen a boy in a field of apple trees throwing rocks at a tree where now Apple's all ... they're firing there's a reason they're firing their you know they've been given something the shooter or they're just leave you alone [noise]\nYeah well it's the great political influence that Kanye West obviously wields\nAnd builds on\nHis cultural influence the guy is a big cultural influence or now you and I may not be listening to ... but there are millions of people who are and young African American men who are watching them\nAnd that is in part it legitimize Donald Trump among that community and there are some in\nThe political class that find that offensive that Kanye West would do this and that this phenomena is happening this is why Donald Trump in that region Rasmussen poll is it thirty six percent\nAnd my bet if I had to do so today is that that's only going to go up that you're ready for the call or let's go Jew Gerald in Florida I Know you've been holding Gerald you wanted to say well\nThank you for having me I\nI Am a patriotic American assertive which I Love my country and I know Kanye West is an American he loved his country I respect that I\nMay not be a fan okay I'm not really a fan of Tanya west but he is an American and I raised him as a brother now what offends me is that lady's or whomever saying that they tainted the White House I haven't I mean I like to go back a few years or remember when uh Obama had\nKnown terrorists in the White House but the media sure didn't claim that uh that was anything bad in painting the White House\nYeah well no no the the assault on the White House that Stephanie rule mentioned will bring that up and a little bit when we come back\nUm this is selective this is selective or we saw a parade of celebrities say all sorts of horrible things and they were applauding knock Kanye West says I Love this president that's a problem will get into it all diamond instill coming up the luring group she'll continue stay right here\n\n\nAnd\nAre some and I've heard this you know learn wrote a book several years ago called shut up and sing which I kind of like a lot\nBecause I Do think it's important for people to stay with in their area of expertise and while it's perfectly acceptable for any entertainer and any American to get politically involved and raise your voice about the things that you were concerned about\nBecause you do something well like you know building a building or or painting or dancing or singing or acting because you might do that well doesn't mean you have any magical understanding of other areas and disciplines of life including politics\nI've been covering politics for almost twenty five years I don't pretend to understand all of it I Know the machinations of the human side being in Washington on Capitol Hill app lobbyist offices watching how the sausage is made with legislation it's ugly\nSo I don't have blinders on when I talk about politics\nBut I sometimes think my friends and I have friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors\nAnd singers I\nThink they flipped through a newspaper or read a magazine\nArticle and because they knew some politicos assume they have insider knowledge or understanding that dilutes the audience I Would argue they don't and sometimes there because they have a louder and larger platform ... their voices are heard more than others and\nThat can obscure reality for them and for the people listening to them\nSo with Kanye West here's what I say chicken with a grain of easy salt listen watch it it was quite a show yesterday I got to say but I don't think no matter what you think Kanye West I don't think it was an assault on the White House he sat at the resolute desk talking to Trump respectfully\nHe yeah he use language that I wouldn't have used but ... that's that's how people in in ... the who talk it's how\nPeople in his line of business law and the president didn't seem overtly disturbed by it so you kind of let it roll you got to rule with this and see where it goes\nBut I think trying to write him off as a crazy person or um you know or someone who's mentally disabled or or a\nOr a you know a ... save your slavery desire that's not productive talk about what he did talk about the moment but don't make it personally destructive and the media does this all the time\nIn moments we will be joined by diamond in silk with a lot to say about this\nOr we will join them next your coals of course are also coming up eight

percent of the black community that is the high bar for Republicans ... percent\nA Romney got I think four percent four percent maybe maybe less in the in the election you rent and Donald Trump had eight percent African American support and twenty sixteen\nThat jumped to eleven percent after he announced initiatives\nIn the black community and unemployment started to drop among African Americans and wages started to go up and bonuses that then went to twenty two percent and now rests musing has the president at thirty six percent support among African Americans that's an extraordinary figure for Republican\n[noise]\nCall Laura now one eight five five forty Laura\nOne of\nDaughter son for\nBut like hey I was making you know they did I get to see my dad always high black\nThat was it was just talking about is how it made me feel like Superman made a Superman that was hot and humid summer man for me\nAbout this and putting it out and this had on they didn't feel like I'm a I'm

something less than yourself\nAnd we're wired that way we want to be in charge you want to move forward men have a drive and they want to be seen as leading\nAnd I think a powerful leader Vita male or female but in the case of a man if you like to see a man in charge yeah and I think ... may have\nTipped off something there again political optics political and cultural sensations\nDrive the end result of politics and this if there is indeed a red wave and these midterms it will be driven in part by moments that we saw yesterday and moments and observations like this\nIt's something instinct to people don't like the way they feel when they listen to some of this stuff\nAnd this is why I Believe Hillary Clinton's\nCampaign fell flat it felt like you know men were being forced to drink soy all day and\nThey felt awful about themselves the me too movement has also had many victories it's great that that accusers can come forward and tell their stories and if they're true the guy should be thrown in jail if there's limitations not in place\nBut it is also unleashed a kind of toxicity between the sexes and the feeling that all men are predators and that all men should be somehow beaten into a corner and are\nAsking girls or dance or a offering to take her out for drinks is somehow an act\nOf sexual assault men do feel that that's part of their conversation every day to Tony Texas you wanted to say what\n[noise] ah one thing I think that is being over war particularly by the mainstream media is that Jim Brown or they're supporting Kanye Jim Brown is a highly respected individual in the black community he is opinionated and outspoken\nAnd the fact that he supported\nA Kanye and had some very nice things to say about the president after the meeting is something I think that is perhaps as significant or even more significant that Conyers because of impact of Jim Brown throughout not only the black community but the white community as well\n... well the ... yeah I agree I think that you know both of these figures represent in the in the arena of sports as well as the music and and pop culture a these\nAre two huge influence there's huge or let's go to David Illinois why do you think everybody so up in arms and angry about this all meet and greet and\nWhite arraignment I [noise] I think the dams have gotten so filled with hate and anger and that's been embraced by the media\nThey slipped and they've exposed they how they really believe blacks are supposed to be have if you do not preach their point of view your racial drink of water\nKnow it's it's I have to tell you I was imagining as I was listening to this what if someone were directing this kind of think toward me and using such personal term\nYour house leave your knee girl who's not reading they said of him I mean this is it's so personal nasty\nAnd beside the point so you can't have a black person sit on an IV equals footing after resolute desk and have a conversation with the president of the United states or your derided\nPutting out the resolute desk and have a conversation with the president of the United states or your derided as a house like that I found that so offensive and on any other day and the other person sitting there that's what the reaction\nWould have been in the media but the moment someone makes another political decision for themselves and decides to talk to a Republican president in this case someone they deeply load\nAnd the tables get turned off by the rules are thrown out and you can hurl invective\nRacism or hatred mental

West\nBlaming I was watching the clip of comedy a on Laura show and something struck me as a possible truce I think we've reached a point where CNN's ratings are higher on the secondary media market than they are in the primary [laughter] meaning\nYou're making the anger and point Laura always says why are we playing Don Lemon he's getting more viewers on my show than he's ever had on his [laughter] that's the point you're making right\nOnly take about forty seven second jobs and and I see more of just show you know edited down to the nuggets of hate and bitterness and envy and ... and the things they despise so much\nOn the other shows I think they've reached the point where so few people are watching but they're paying attention playing it elsewhere to show exactly\nHow hateful they are and how out of touch their ratings are lower than the food network people like tiny are reaching an audience and they're bitter and angry about it and it's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there's truth there um I thank you for the call\nBut there there's no doubt I mean you look at the ratings CNN is just it's tragic I mean it's really tragic and on big night for like during the cabinet battle and things that they were they were really hurting I mean in comparison to Fox Fox was having four six million people watching\nAnd CNN had a half a million people very interesting what's happening out there but again if that runs been exactly to what I was saying a moment ago these elites think they will tell the public what they want and if they keep doing it\nThe public will have nowhere to go but to them the public will eventually get the genius and keep watching it doesn't work that way\nProgramming no longer works that way and there are no longer three networks that hold the monopoly on all levels in the country\nAnd whether it's the people programming ABC with this Roseanne rebuild\nOr the folks at CNN shoving Don Lemon down people's throats I just don't think it works it ... it doesn't matter what I think it doesn't work it demonstrably provable he does not work Chris New Jersey wanted to say what\nI like a a\n... a Democrat who I looked at the end but doesn't agree with the train of thought on political slant on them you know like on the on the young or even American thing or whatever I\n... like I don't know how to do that in a way\nThat a certain way again like I look at how you know in all of a bottle animal\n... down or is that like ... ... ... and then at ... at any of that all the ...\nThat's how they get Roseanne and the ... bought our first\nWell I think you know John Goodman in in um interviews has said you know I think my character is going to spend most of the season moping around\nOr you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's\nProbably right that look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality the only reason it ABC was already out of pocket so they were either going to do some show would these people or they were just going to write paychecks to these folks go off and have a vacation\nBut they were on the book so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to die you bet I think it'll be canceled after a few shows that's my production will see thank your cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what

I have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean no maybe you need to move twenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers you're giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you have it\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes\nOr whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out and back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage was from where you're looking to get you you might be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall this I carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other and now you want to compare Manhattan to Abilene, Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you're looking at different end of town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of Kerry and let's see where we are at that point um\nBut I don't think you can um what your your numbers just don't work I thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd I don't mean to you and I'm On my baby steps and I just finished paying off my car last week good for you and\nI have on a ... a a pie and I was talking to them and I said that car payment money I'm I'm going to be an attack in my house next and even than back in ...\nIn fact and I'm like on a few on\nThe wire you can food's one of the baby steps sight of the\nHouse next no it doesn't\nWhen you finish being when you're one hundred percent that free or anything but the house what's the next baby step what's baby step number three\nI'm thick flown they've in there you go yeah\nYeah\nYou already have that done yeah oh I thought your car wasn't paid off\nAll my colleagues at all\nOh it is now paid off oh good okay so you've got baby step to done and then you got maybe step three done with your money saved for your emergency fund right yeah I Do and much maybe step for\nStep on you\nKnow I used to force Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement which is what this more of us are pro was telling you the baby steps five is saving for college and six is anything above those two things you throw at the house all day\nBut let's go back and look at the baby steps again and financial ... through that and you are getting advice from the smart Mr ... that is consistent with what we're teaching so that's why I think for the call Jennifer is in Houston, Texas Hi Jennifer how are you\nEither have hey what's up\nI'm calling because I'm ashamed of my dad and I wanted to know if I should postponed getting married or if I should continue to get married but I'm ... baby step to to stack up money for the wedding\nOkay I'm a what is it going to cost you to get what's the wedding ...\nWell\nFell right now we're in the stages\nWe would bring shopping in a family that are involved but he hasn't proposed at\nOkay right so but I have no money and I have a lot of debt so that\nMight not know how much debt do you have\nI have about one hundred and forty eight thousand dollars in debt\nYou do um a lot of that are you a\nDog with my boyfriend it in terms of how different we are he would be like baby step for and I just barely got out of baby step line you know\nOr you know what are you a doctor or lawyer what's your debt from [laughter]\nI mean a lot of bad mistakes I don't have once again none of the things at once the debt on [noise] um\nPrimarily student loans a car and a personal on credit cards you what do you own your car um I oh I have Thirteen thousand left and what's your degree in um\nI have a bachelor's in economics and I'm an NBA\nOkay so what are you doing how much do you make\n'em I make about Seventy one um I work in IT right now\nAnd for you okay so you're just coming out getting things going and you know making certainly want us to single person you're going to attack this debt very very aggressively and very quickly okay so you're working on getting out of that your boyfriend is already out of that and um is your ah parents or his parents are going to help with the wedding calling for do you have any idea\nUm I think it just be as to I Know the the thing about it we talked about magically briefly overview about finances I Know he had the ... the ...

know a\nSingle young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now but a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your

are you\nThank you for taking my call certainly how can I help\nUm well I just started get program and August I'm I have currently pay down three thousand dollar that um that that actually after that I was making payment on a monthly payments on how\nI'm right now I Need to start on like that that will collection which will get out I didn't move out and dollars mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm or less like addict Seventeen hundred dollar bill that there there are are\nFrom David take funding hundred for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousands of dollars that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if your true\nThat is true that is not given us except on a mortgage on your own ... is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave a cashier what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay let's let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars right\nAnd so it's still a good deal but your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you if they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that as I follow through on that but if in\nThe larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine and send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that\nI'm by April ... you know that you may have in addition to that now if you had a large return coming because you're over withholding well in that\nCase so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question\nThank you for joining U.S Open phones is ours we talk about your life and your money our question that comes from

legacy meeting with our family the meeting will consist of adults\nAnd miners how often should we have these meetings and do we share specific dollar amounts with every one or just share with each individual what will affect them um annually\nWould be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it okay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information\nOur children in our case did not know our wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised like\nRegular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background and um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about but then as we presented it to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery as for me and my house we sort of the lower\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God and that takes a little of the woman who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally immature and her sister with him and we do about once a year this is the day Ramsey show now\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend a quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at

it yeah and I went from a whole whole spending stupid all the way over to a wide open smart yeah yeah wow\nYeah we just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... few classes and then we

marriage is just hanging on by a thread and you say okay but let's try this together and we're not we're not going to spend like what you're spending how out of the next three to four months look like\nFrom the from the I mean almost gone to we're going to turn and try there's there had it had to be pretty bumpy yeah yeah it was hard to trust her ...\nShe spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and and debt and and I did it take you to trust her it probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean he probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this when you really had to see that that a little bit a glimpse of oh you're right it is it grew yeah trust grew over time\nWell in the moment I got home from your class I was going through my doors for trying to sell so I mean what can I sell

me but I Do worry about my great grandchildren with her and her hung I worry about the fact that you have crazy people like Maxine Waters you've gotten older I mean it's the very thing that you talk about in your book about stopping mass hysteria\nThere are crazy people that are formed mobs\nAnd had gone by elected officials not just to disagree with people then right or find on the rise in right in public places and Michael that's never happened before and I'm\nNever happened never happened before and when you hear idiots on CNN like Don lemonade saying that you can call them a mob\nAnd there's nothing wrong with this kind of action we have now moved into a new world in America when the left like as you start with Eric Holder the former chief law enforcement officer in America saying when they go low we kick them I've never heard anything like this\nYou don't even hear that from radicals I mean this is really bizarre and uh for him to say that and to in science that kind of violence against people and you know we've had Steve Sebelius who took a bullet you had\nRand Paul who was attacked from behind and a cowardly or attack on his back while leaders mowing his own lawn you have the the kind of things that my daughter has experienced the ... on the in Florida has experienced is Ted Cruz and his wife\nHad happened a curse Nielsen that the H a secretary and Mitch McConnell has passed\nI mean this is getting out of control this is no longer an isolated incident and this tearing down by people who are so lunatic that they try to scratch through a ... ton barn stores the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way this is Petra launched a\nWell above Governor Huckabee it's coming from the top there actually telling them it's OK to become unhinged and violent you got to Hillary Clinton saying we don't need civility until we're in power again and we take the power away from them\nSo it's not coming out of a vacuum it's coming from the top down and I think someone needs to say to them cool it because you know what I Know one mass hysteria gets out of control it doesn't limited self to one side of the aisle\nWell and and I do worry and I hope that the people on the conservative side will maintain a sense of decorum we can be passionate we can be a very strong as folk and\nBut we should never take A People's freedom and liberty from them and that's what you do when you go to a place where they're having a restaurant meal or when they're at their homes or when they're trying to enjoy a movie\nAnd and when you take their liberty from them that's not America Michael that's not what we're about we're about district green but disagreeing and the right way and the right place at the right time\nOr we don't go and hound people try to get them out of business and that's what these loans are doing\nOkay so the question becomes\nHow do we stop it I I spent half of show yesterday Governor Huckabee speaking to attorneys who are actually representing people who've defended themselves in restaurants against these left wing mobs it's not an easy question\nBecause there were limits to what you can do to defend yourself but on the on the and we can't run away just because they want us to run away and that's the topic for another day we're talking about\nThis issue but ... for a few seconds to talk about the mid term elections I personally believe Governor Huckabee that\nThe violence of the quote new Democratic Party as Eric Holder calls them\nHe's actually saying this is the new Democratic Party we kick them when they're down\n... I actually think that this is going to alienate the vast middle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to\nOh I actually think that this is going to alienate the vast middle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to have the the health effects that the radicals wanted to add that even Hillary Clinton thinks it's going to have what do you think\nI totally agree because there are a lot of people who are Democrats are people who think left of center or who are unabashed liberal they're decent human beings and they're not hateful people and they're they're not looney tunes are they do have some sense of personal responsibility they don't want to see people get hurt injured\nAnd there's a whole move on to walk away movement interestingly it was started by young then I have on my show I'm Brandon struck out who it is interestingly a New York a activist or he's he's gay\nHe probably is the last person lot of people think would be on my show we hit it off great we had a terrific can counter um but he has been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and is leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the Facebook page and stay in their house and the people who are\nAre truly you know liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off the deep end and they no longer can associate themselves with something there's lie to them and that his or encourage people to be violent\nAnd uh and and to destroy people's personal liberty but\nCovenant government can be you are a media star you're also a musician you're also a devout Christian and the Christian teaching say that you should turn the other cheek but that doesn't mean turn the other cheek forever does it\nTurn the other cheek does not mean that you're up a tip squeak I I think people's you know say blanket of me meat does not mean week\nThe word ... comes from a word and it means strength brought under such ... it's the same word that would be used to speak of domesticating a horse\nWhich doesn't mean you make the horse meat it means you channel his strength and his energy and Jesus said blessed it at the mic what he's saying is blessed are those who keep their strength to have power but who channel it in a way that it's constructed\nSo this idea that Christians are just push rovers and we sit back and take it into Chen\nOr you know that's not true we're going to stand up for justice for what's right\nI think it's more of an appropriate for people who are believers not to be angry and not to try to seek revenge but to try to seek justice and justice is not being served when people lied about when they're accused falsely through things that are incredibly horrible things that happened that human beings\nAnd it is the\nAbsolute imperative for true people of faith the fight against those injustices so anybody who thinks that that didn't even get like a world is going to sit back and just a act like it's okay to be Savage ravaged and destroy boy are they ever law\nWell the next step is going to be what happened in the in the old days in other words if we don't stop these left wing mobs they will go into churches and upset sermons knocked over all there is we can't permit this and I think that we we people of belief we people of traditional values have\nTo understand that self defense is the only kind of defense there is at the end of the day but I don't want to get into that right now I Want to stick to the positive and a\nWill go back again to the politics of the day the country moving so far away even from the Democratic party moving into the street violence of the communist movements I Believe politically is going to have a uh uh the opposite effect in the midterms I think you just agreed with me correct\nAbsolutely I I Do feel that\nThis a blue wave ah is is maybe grossly over estimated I think we're going to see a huge turnout from Republicans and conservatives who are beginning to wake up that this is no time to sleep\nThat after we saw what happened the Kavanaugh hearings the attempt to ah just destroy the processes and Michael when it comes down to it let's be real clear\nWhat's at stake here is whether or not we have a system of government in which we decide things five elections not by tantrums\nUh the reason we're having all of these issues is because the Democrats have refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen elections and we let them get away with it if we reward them for their bad behavior you get more of it\nIs the same thing when you raise your child or trained her dog than getting the reward you get more out the behavior that you consequence you get less out ... editor of the Petra lumps this spring the yelling the violence the tax physically and otherwise but wind that struck fitness\nWe kept rewarded we've got to go out when elections and what you're talking about earlier a there has to be legal\nI'm struck fitness recount rewarded we've got to go out when the lectures and what you're talking about earlier or has to be the legal consequences for people who engage in this absolutely\nA hundred percent ... percent\n... and and again Governor Huckabee I I I'm admirer the work you're doing on trinity TV I look forward to being with you or later on in the day and it'll be on this weekend given the audience please the times of the television shows again if in case they missed that\nFor a lot of them on a Saturday or Sunday like that for shots

here I Can't sit here and say I thought that was so smart does it agitate me day and I know\nWell I get over it yeah I already have gotten over it but I'm just trying to say to you be careful with your worship not healthy\nYou're not supposed to worship of president no matter who it is that's why my monologue and the first hour so bring you know when it went over the heads of most listeners it did I Know it it it's just like my books dot mass hysteria\nBecause it's not a cartoon cover of people with the a cartoon people don't want to read history they don't want to understand\nThe history of what they're living through they don't want to understand context the new ones they don't want it\nThey want black or white white or black good bad they're good they're bad where the good guys that

ask them questions and not wise a sky blue I don't know what I asked the moon well remembers what kids they ask their fathers I always was taught to try and come up with my own answer my father wouldn't answer a question he was\nFrom the old world he made me answer my question\nAnd he taught me how to think for myself and that makes me a great minority in the ... of true believers who hate us most people in America today the true believers a true haters there's absolutely no in between this is the problem that I've been trying to tell you about\nThis is why the country's falling apart this is why we're on the verge of civil war the large middle ground has been lost [noise]\nThe middle grounds gone there's no middle ground in the meeting\nThis\nI should say why single out our own country as being worse than the others that was the point I'm trying to make that why have we vilified our own nation as being worse than any nation on earth ...\nAnd it's all connected to mass hysteria and group thing\nWhich I carefully kind of on couple here in in my book stop mass hysteria and I I Want to say one thing to uh to go into the book for one minute we don't have much time and other people that great and having me on I've written political books and they've done very well in this book I Try to bridge politics with history and\nAnd I found out that a little history goes a long way such as saying to this bartender can you name one country on earth that was not founded and blood and conquest ...\nAnd it's instantaneous the answer say no I really can't and in doing that by learning a few things you can probably turn arguments with rational people now that's a big coffee at a rational people\nRight yeah but and I think there are some and I'm like on asking you so you engage with your audience what your caller is telling you about the deep divide between themselves your callers that they're conservative what are they telling you about that divide between themselves and their neighbors who might be ideologically opposed to them\n[laughter] you can't say here's the problem I think the battle lines are drawn\nAs a I have\nSaid before and unfortunately I see happening ... years ago wrote a book or stop becoming civil war now there's a becoming sort of a common thing like are we having another civil war you know [noise] uh I think the battle lines are drawn the Mason Dixon Line is very clear people are on both sides families are divided just like before the civil war and\nWe were waiting for a Fort Sumter and I think Dianne Feinstein was a living embodiment I'm a Fort Sumter with a lipstick I've never seen anything like a woman trying to set a nation on fire as what she did to this man\n... ... I think that's how I felt kind of fourth plane went down three hundred and ...\nA big it's a big problem the history has been walked into everything white is bad everything\nI don't know him three times higher than\nIt's a big it's a big problem that history has been walked into everything white is bad everything American is bad because the radicals took over the educational system a long time ago Common Core is still in most of the school systems\nAre Trump was supposed to eliminated\nUnder education secretary divorced it's still there you know there's a lot of issues that we we can go into my point in writing stop mass hysteria is to try to give people pieces of history that they can use\nAs soundbites to try to get a rational discussion going in their own family with people who disagree with them yeah but don't even know the history of the country [noise] [noise] yeah\nI mean you're asking a big question do they think I don't know what the opposition thinks that America is the worst place on earth and in any one white as an evil racist or how does this come out of this happened\nI was out and has happened that we've reached the point that a person like a Palestinian terrorists Linda saucer in my opinion a Palestinian terrorists can lead a women's march and call a Susan Collins a white supremacists because of her vote however we reached this point that any one of them that low caliber would be taken seriously by the media\nYeah no it Michael it's a great point who is speaking of hysteria and it goes to the part of the title of your book about the witch hunt let's talk about the current which on the Russia collusion probe\nIn quotes led by special counsel Robert Mueller now this is very chilling to me and the Gina as people who have worked on political campaigns engaged in campaign strategy so now mothers' day Michael is reportedly investigating Republican researcher Peter Smith\nSmith raised about a hundred thousand dollars to find Hillary Clinton's emails the wall Street Journal's reporting that Mueller is interested in Smith because he told people\nThat he tried to recruit that he was connected to several Trump campaign officials including guys like General Michael Flynn says Smith is a is a hundred thousand dollars from for investors on top of the fifty thousand dollars he himself put in to me Michael this is chilling because this looks like motors attempt to criminalize\nStandard old campaign strategies but even worse first protected political donations and opposition research because the wrong guy won the election I mean is this not the definition of hysteria\nLook we're Mueller when I first started with the Russia collusion which fell apart and I'm so you arrested people did commit crimes unrelated to Trump and now he's going after the campaign individuals for things they did that as you say are legal buddies dropped the Russia collusion investigation right\nWhich let us not forget was his original mandate in other words there was a ball field with perimeters on it and the perimeters war Russia collusion well now he's branched into anything he wants to condemning anyone he wants he is now a law unto themselves and I believe it's long overdue the Trump fire Mueller frankly\nMueller has greatly exceeded the mandate\nThat he was given this is the kind of persecution that destroys the nation so to answer your question of course is violating the ban civil rights mhm where where will they stop it's like the guillotine who's next\nYou know the way ... now arrest somebody on Fox News who had Donald Trump on his show too many times is that the next thing say that's collusion between the media and Donald Trump is that now a crime on the on the Robert Mueller\nYeah I'd sure seems that way Michael\nWe only have like thirty seconds to many but I really want to get to that because I think it it kept the role of the Internet envision today and how to branch that gap\n...

Saudis image Saudi conflict in Turkey that it's an absolute\nGame changer [noise]\nOut this is what's amazing and when we get back I Want to dive into this incredible story there are reports\nNow that this Turkish [noise] that they have audio and video proof [noise] all the murder [noise] all the Saudi journalist [noise] folks dino just means\nAudio and video prove inside the consulate hanging out I think you know it's just me back in a minute [noise]\n\nHey it's their blood store dot com was the first place to buy custom window treatments online and they know what they're doing they've been doing this for over Twenty years they've covered over\nTo mail your windows and know exactly how to get you\n\nThere's a lot of money and arms deals folks with us vendors or we'll get into that Lindsey Graham by the way it has said this is a quote behavior like this is unacceptable violates every international norm it can't be condoned\nThe way we deal with Saudi Arabia will be a message to others\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have written a letter some in Congress they want the arms deals stop there are calls for sanctions and a halt\nTo about a hundred ten billion dollars in arms sales some are calling for the coming off of relations with Saudi Arabia I let's let's dive in just a little bit deeper here\nBecause I apparently this evidence here and now with alleged audio video proof\nAnd this gets pretty gruesome the reports are that the the Turkish have\nThe audio and video of him going in being interrogated him being beaten\nAnd then him being killed and there have been some reports that he was caught up inside the embassy that he was actually dismembered with an electric saw\nAnd then taken out taken out in pieces\nAnd is able to report that they use that I mentioned this yesterday we heard about the saw yesterday there was a report yesterday that they use the bones saw and now new today is that the Saudis might have\nActually employed or brought in a forensic specialist\nTo this member of the guy and take them apart I mean folks this is I mean this is pulp fiction that I mean this is crazy stuff\nThat he was killed he goes in again essentially a marriage license his fiance is outside and she's panicking when he didn't come back out on October second they felt they were going to get away with this\n\n[noise] so a head of that we have our American intel uh claims and we we saw this earlier the wake of any Tuesday or Wednesday or stories were coming out that us intel\nApparently intercepted communications from Saudi officials and they were plotting to actually lured Jamal Tuskegee back to Saudi Arabia\nThat's I guess what they missed surely wanted to do\nBecause of his very outspoken efforts against the Saudi kingdom and as I mentioned the Saudi crown prince this Mohammed bin some months\nSo [noise] [noise]\nKnow they wanted to take him to get him out of a a circular detained them in Saudi Arabia that was at the very least that they wanted to do so I it's not known at least not to us when the communique was actually intercepted but in the ...\nThat they wanted to do so I it's not known at least not the U.S when\nThe communique was actually intercepted but believe that it was some time last month sometime in September\nAnd this is when ... column started to well ramp up and\nAmp up and be very critical of the Saudi kingdom and its its rumors or and incidentally he never called for any regime change but he was very critical of the the Saudi royal family and uh\nThe crown prince et cetera now the condemnation folks as far and wide on this\nUh business circles a political circles here are both Democrats and Republicans in our uh governments are very concerned about this the condemnation is getting louder and louder\nThere's this uh this is Sally summit coming up and I see a lot of the news organizations have cancel plans to cover it\nA ... this economic summit a minute you and the secretary the treasury Mnuchin is still going the last that we heard here and a President Trump's in a pretty tough spot this is again a bizarre situation\nYou know you can't have governments are\nMurdering people\nWell I guess a Vladimir putting does it all the time\nWhich is something else which we probably should deal with are trying to kill employees and people are around the globe that's a you know vitamin ...\nBought I mean this is a very very complicated issue you know also\nRemember turkey and I've got a lot of issues with turkey Oregon and his government the clamping down the uh the the freedom is being taken away a more of the the the radical Islamic thinking has come with early gum you had that coup attempt\nAnd well we we know what happened there\nOur relations with or to God have been a pretty strained you know we just have this big story earlier today as well with the the preacher\nWho has been released now\nA who was accused of being part of a plot to overthrow a the the Turkish government and Oregon\nSo that was a Brunson so he's out and I don't know if he's not in Germany he'll be in Germany shortly to undergo a some physical checkups et cetera before he's brought back to the United states so you know we've had our issues and problems with turkey and turkey\nA NATO member a NATO ally has increasingly over the last couple of years they seem to be drifting away from western principles and being a member nation in NATO should be about and more towards a radical a physician\nSo ... is our relationship with turkey getting but anyway this is a very complicated matter Saudi Arabia folks is the main cog\nIn our foreign policy in the middle East that I've said this many times Saudi Arabia is an absolute power check\nOn Iran and also the Syria as well now Saudi Arabia\nIs one of the main components well even call it the secret source\nAs far as Jared Kushner's Middle East peace process is concerned and what he's developed in what Jerry ... trying to push so to say that this is very sensitive it's a clear understatement\nBecause Jared Kushner or a Jew by the way has cultivated a very deep friendship with the crown prince with Mohammed bin some up\nAnd he and the family I mean they're now implicated in this disappearance that\nTorture the beating the interrogation the murder\nSaw cutting this member meant of ... a U.S permanent resident\nAnd then we have the arms deal here and we know that this came up at the White House yesterday and the president essentially said no we're looking into this we're investigating of people on the ground but this is not going to interrupt the arms deal this a hundred and ten billion dollars are going to\nA U.S companies to us of the arms manufacturers so Lawson is the number a hundred percent accurate as really a hundred and ten billion dollars ... who knows I mean that's a that's a lot of money anyway slice it's certainly the Saudis want to buy a whole lot of crap and a whole lot of course there's no doubt about\n... and\nSaudi Arabia if they do leave the list as far as us weapons exports now the president\nIs well in a tough climb right now\nAs far as us weapons exports now the president\nIs well in a tough climate right now and uh there's many in our government both sides of the aisle who are isolating the president for him continuing to stand with the salaries on this I certainly think that Trump is being a little bit more\nAmbivalent are cautious than it needs to be\nThat I'm not saying that the arms deal needs to be canceled\nI you know what what Trump is saying here is that he's trying to save the arms deal because he doesn't want to see a U.S jobs evaporated\nI don't think that our foreign policy should ever be tied to jobs because that gives the other side in age\nAnd given in she'll take a mile and then other countries are witnessing what's going on as well and that's not a good position to be here you know the arguments\nWhat should occur here is to essentially make this a twofold situation if you know bottom line is if the Saudis if they don't get the arms from us then they're going to make deals with the Chinese they going to make deals with a lot of reporting in Russia\nSo it's going to give the Russians and the Chinese it's going to give them more of a foothold\nIn the region so that's you know obviously a problem as well so listen it's not a a ... matter I mean there's a very complicated situation you know if we sell the arms\nTo the Saudis and then they\nNeed to come back to us over time for service and parts and tech support your cold the answer to four to five minutes so I mean we do have some leverage over the Saudis in that fashion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city":
