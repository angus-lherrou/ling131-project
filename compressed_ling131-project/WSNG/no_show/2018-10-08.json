done in a long time because it's coming from my own heart my own Melanie Mayron there from a very true story that's happening all in the same time I'm from and that never happens I'm a very emotional person right now has played of arcane Fox News [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nWhy if\nYou just waking up you're just tuning in fifty one forty nine cultures the culture is achieved now thirty hours a debate happens and that means about five PM if they use all thirty hours\nThere'll be a boat there'll be a boat on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation the most controversial a nomination in our lifetimes by bar hopefully there's nothing like this ever again liberal or conservative but nobody benefits from this there are no winners except for maybe ratings those people have to be a part of it\nAh people know nothing about the Supreme Court or no nothing about politics or they are all involved in this cause it about sexual assault women's uh respect in about ... you know unjustifiably are accused or you know are interested to be proven guilty unless you Chris Coons comes out and says oh no you you got to prove yourself innocent\nSo I'm fifty one forty nine why is that because mccaskey Republican voted no direct voted yes and one Democrat including Joe Manchin now at three o'clock today in about three and a half hours\nSenator McConnell is will now how she will vote tomorrow now if she says I Will not vote for this tomorrow that means is fifty fifty\nI don't know why she would change your mind what other words and investigative tools you using to come to a different conclusion but let's say for some weird reason she's split\nYour fifty fifty okay\nNow Mike Pence comes in and he went right but does Joe Manchin the Democrat we want to be responsible for Kavanaugh will be going to the Supreme Court I say yes it'll allow him to be the most powerful person in the Senate and it'll be can persona non grata for awhile with the Democrats\nBut in the big big she's going to be more powerful in Austin, Texas Brad hey Brad\nHey blanc great job with do you have right okay so I Want to say ... ...\nFind a negotiated solution if the north box and Doug can pursue\nGetting her ... he was going to turn the more difficult measures now\nI I was also very nervous about the war talk that the president\nSeemed to be I'm engaged again throughout most of the twenty Seventeen and I'm not sure the wild swings between war drums and love letters is a constructive one bird circular ... have to make clear to the tribe knew they were going to get very top\nConsumer interesting uses a certain formula for this it's worked for decades and then the president comes in and through all that on his head or you curious it all\nA bean that sometimes you just do things totally different whether if it's football incomes is running shoe ... they start with a shotgun and things change you know the forward pass was something that football didn't embrace now all of a sudden it's common place the way he goes in there and makes these deals are you curious it all to see if\nBy throwing everything in the air if we could get out of the sixty years stalemate\nSet\nUp a fair point and you know I was a part of the\nThe now ... years of attempts to be there for our North Korea and we didn't get Bert are fully admit that we tried hard we try and soft and none of it seemed to work and so the president trying something new is necessarily a bad back\nBut I think it needs to do two things in particular first keep an eye on the ball with isn't about a piece\nOf treaty or some declaration of war that that it's about stopping the production of this material that now may 'em out to dozens of nuclear weapon um and then the second he has to make sure that cause other choices contribute\nTwo dogs and some nuclear weapon um and then the second he has to make sure that his other choices contribute to this so for example starting a huge trade war with China probably doesn't make Beijing more likely to try and help us on the north Korea and I'm sure\nThat's true uh we are doing that although it has to be addressed and maybe it could all be leverage a we have that as well as a terrible relations with Russia all sides agree\nUm but they're all related as well so well and also with turkey whereas stalemate with turkey so these are these are the problematic ... some of the most of the problematic nations\nAnd at least we're addressing a moral head on and very curious to see where this goes I think on some level on the human level\nWhen he gets a taste of western culture you had a chance to get a little bit of respect he's going to South Korea he's looking around he's in his thirties I think he's a horrible person don't get me wrong he's been to China three times where\nUp until we started storing relations he hasn't do you think on some level he is looking to change things in his country\nI think that's what I called quest for his ... is there is no doubt he is a very different leader than his father and his grandfather he went to prep school in Switzerland so here's the ... what the West is capable up he apologized to president a moon\nOf South Korea in saying that well if you come to a young you'll probably applied because our roads are so bad but not like you're ... ... email us who have been a cause they shouldn't have been very already\nThat the real question now is on the the big questions the big issues are coming here the Korean War could party control um could Google a human rights a record of an or banned the nuclear weapons themselves they're willing to trade and we just don't know that\nWe don't ah William Toby thanks so much appreciate fascinating time we'll see if it might punt pale comes out anything on

just glad\nWe ruined Brett [noise]\n\nWhatever happens\nI'm just glad we ruined\nBrett Kavanaugh's life\nThe writer Ariel doom is posted on Twitter tumors later briefly made\nHer account private preventing others from viewing her posts without her approval\nHer tweet came as the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a fifty forty eight vote with the Republicans saying that the several allegations of decades old\nSexual misconduct\nBrought against him simply lacks sufficient cooperation and uh it just wasn't true ... apologized on Sunday\nClaiming she was being sarcastic because Kavanaugh's elevator to the Supreme Court demonstrated that his life had not in fact\nBeen entirely derailed by the accusations\nAs some Republicans had claimed the last couple of weeks have been hard for the country and me personally do moss wrote\nThe complexity of frustration anger and sadness can't be accurately conveyed on Twitter\nAnd I regret might tone deaf attempt at sarcasm in the wake of it\nDo my previously had quoted news analysis pieces criticizing Kavanaugh for\nSaying the accusations had destroyed him including a piece that observed the bar for a man's ruined is apparently\nQuite low\nReached for further comment by Fox News CBS said do most apology spoke for itself the network confirmed that do Mars currently works for ... show\nWell there you have there you have another another writing\nI'll tell you I ah I Can't believe this happened but it does it does all the time\nIt really does read I mean the thing about uh stuff like that type of show is political satire has always been something that has been the bread and butter of late night TV there is a line they can't cross and part of that has to do with what you do post on the Internet just because\nEverybody can see it anybody can share and there's a good chance that\nSomeone is going to take it the wrong way just because you can't project a voice on I mean on the Internet unless you do it on a video but there's a big difference from well that\nGuy should deserves to be in and that guy deserves to be in there the the\nBig difference and you're not going to be able to get that tone from one message you know especially on the Internet\nBut you know something if you look at late night TV and ratings oh absolute are higher than ever but who do you think helps\nOn those ratings they have his picture up all the time on wrong exactly I mean it I don't know Trump Yup I mean that's the thing grad\nAs much as Americans may like to make fun of Trump you got to realize that the two are helping each other big time right now because the more hate that get generated from these talk shows fuels people don't want to vote for that man to as ... and that person to be the leader\nAnd the more people that do that in turn provide more ratings to watch it too crazy machine but it's the Democrats do I'm causing their own demise with this and starting this machine over and over again well it's a it's just to everybody and\nYou wonder about again but again or whether you like Donald Trump or you don't like Donald Trump he gets\nAnd you wonder about again but again or whether you like Donald Trump or you don't like Donald Trump he gets he gets it done\nAnd uh he got it done and he's not afraid to say what he feels so he's got to expect though he's got to expect some of the Americans that listen to women watch him to say the same things back\nTo him that's that's our way right\nBut it's a it really is an incredible uh\nUh Kavanaugh's nomination\nWas nearly derailed this report nearly derailed by Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that the judge assaulted her when they were teenagers in the Nineteen eighties\nWhich sparked uproar and force Republicans to delay the confirmation vote for a week to allow time for a supplemental FBI background check Trump\nTook a victory lap for an\nEnthusiastic crowd at a rally in Topeka, Kansas on what he had old as a historic night so this is going to\nGo around and around and around for a long long\nTime but I go back to what I said very early this morning the reason that this happened was because the Democrats did\nNot want another conservative\nOn the court that's what did there's no question\nIn my mind and a on a fifty\nForty eight votes so you're going to have people protesting and by the way people are being paid some are being paid to protest\nBut a\nMajority leader Mitch McConnell described Kavanaugh as a superstar that's what he called them and didn't care what anybody set so it's a you could say to yourself is a very interesting world\nThat we live in but we'll make it no question no question about it\nOkay coming after twenty eight minutes after the hour of six o'clock in the morning\nAnd I've got a couple of things a little bit later about seven what eight I was uh on the road this weekend or both or\nA friday and Saturday Sunday it's a very very busy weekend but I'll tell you something right now the people\nAll of you and I met him at some of you but you are really\nTerrific people you really are and the more you get out\nAnd you're more you you see the folks you sit you have a cup of coffee with them the more you realize how lucky we truly are that's how I feel\nThat's how I feel I uh have a great deal of admiration for the folks that I meet that listen to the program\nAnd uh it's something that I think all of us have to think of from from time to time\nAs far as our weather goes up right now it's going to be cloudy damp and cooler\nThe highest near sixty five tonight the cloudy mile lows near fifty nine and tomorrow times of clouds and sun\nWarmer with a high rise near Seventy seven degrees so the weather is not good to be are not going to be too bad and that is good news weather's field right now we're sixty two knowing to sixty two Hartford\nWaterbury and and field all at\nAnd you know somebody and it it's he's just a natural ... somebody came across very very well and this was the first time\nHe's just a natural somebody came across very very well and this was the first time that I have seen him do this a debate and that's ...\nI had never uh I've heard him speak of course I mean I Know him very well but uh there was just something about him on on Sunday that a major say wait\nA minute now this guy knows what he's talking about well of course he does so ah it's going to be I think probably one of the most interesting elections for governor than we've had\nA long time I truly truly think it is and I'm going to talk with Christine about that or a two and a couple of other other things but it was quite a weekend you know when you when you think about heart bird and how we care about heartbreak when you think about\nUh the the big big uh a\nPlay that they had one night that they had a I mean they had everybody all kinds of performers so again it's a it's very interesting really really truly\nTruly is an I uh I think I was thinking about it last night uh that this could be a toss up as far as\nA ... governors concern and I I think it's it's probably be one of the closest ever there's just something that I saw Sunday\nThat tells me that and there could be some surprises so it's a it's an interesting time in Connecticut but there's things that we have\nWe cannot go on the way we are we just can't we just can't but ah we'll get there no doubt about it okay twenty minutes now\nSix forty one Nineteen Minutes before the hour of seven o'clock in the morning I ah was very very thrilled and that's the word I'm using because uh I have never\nNever uh interviewed or a police officer\nAnd uh as far as looking for troops\nAnd I knew that Hartford was going to do this uh because uh the mayor we've talked with him we talk with him every

nineteenth police officers are going to be able to apply online\nSo a heart for it is going to increase\nTheir police force and I think this is a a a marvelous marvelous thing to do because in fact the police today with what they have to go through and and uh uh they they are not enough of them there's not enough of them\nBut we'll have that information for you this morning at a at nine nine thirty five okay it is a six forty two Eighteen minutes now before the our ... and again uh here we started to a brand new\nWeek are together you know I was looking over the weekend at some of the

I think surprised a lot of people I really do\nI think that I've Greenville has a real graph of the issues that are are facing the state of Connecticut\nAnd uh you know I think that he just doesn't have a you know the fundraising or the ... behind them are obviously he's not running with either the party's he's running as an independent candidate petitioning candidate on the ballot so\nI wrote a victory as a little bit tougher\nAnd uh what I'm saying is that you know he's only pulling at four percent basically and all the polls that have been out but I'm saying that he is probably he is going to play the role of spoiler 'em\nAnd you know it's unclear at the moment who he's going to um well I Hope but um I think that he could take a vote both from Democrats and from Republicans\nAgain or when you look at a Ned Lamont um I I I don't know I just\nUh you know there are those who say that he's going to be our next governor but uh and I'm not putting him down at all but I was not impressed yesterday\nYeah I mean in order to to win you know Connecticut being a traditionally blue state there are more unaffiliated voters and the state of Connecticut um so\nYou know presumably you could win only with democratic votes um but you know most uh most people have to um get those at affiliated voters and and so that you know kind of what\nThe general election is all about and and the pivot towards on getting those unaffiliated voters and making yourself now and\nI'm outside of the the party apparatus that he does have\nHe just gave his campaign another five million dollars I Know so so he had the the the funds\nUm in order to get out there and get his message out there um and and get his TV ad out there and you know so he does have fundraising advantage over I'm ...\nNow there that's the name ... now ... now there are those that I talk with that think that he's going to be our next governor but then\nYou know when I saw you yesterday we had a conversation and ah you said to me that he doesn't talk to that many reporters just kind of like a uh like the president of the United states does she doesn't talk to many reporters either\n[laughter] yeah well I still basically what's been happening is that uh he has\nShe doesn't talk to many reporters either\nYeah well I still basically what's been happening is that uh he has he said in the public financing so if he had gotten the public financing\nThe day after the primary ... would have had six point five million dollars in his bank account and said he um he could it and he went and he went to go raise money on his own which is a much harder task um so basically a lot of his time has been spent fundraising\nWhich means a lot of his time can't be on the campaign trail talking to to voters are getting his message across um we we may have kind of cross the threshold because his campaign reached out yesterday so I Will be going out with Bob stuff and not be on the campaign trail today for the first time really\nUh yes 'cause when you talk to me yesterday you didn't know\nI did not know now I'm so uh you know I think that we may have turned to a point where he's realizing that he doesn't need the media in order to get his message across um\nYou know if you don't have the money the idea would be that you know you use the media um to reach the public and to reach the voters\nAre traditionally um so but if you do have money basically you could avoid the media if you wanted to avoid the media uh because money is the message and and you can get the message to voters by you know I'm I guess stepping over the media are avoiding the media\nWell I'll tell you are talking with a Christian Stewart who I invited on my program yesterday uh we were at the uh the big the big show which I call it\nYesterday at the Emanuel synagogue in West Hartford and uh there was over forty ... above for\nHow many people there there was there was four hundred a hundred and some odd though yeah\n[noise] so it was a big a big crowd now or did\nThis just happened as far as you're concerned with with the with Bob stepping out she ah there were people that thought he had the money situation but this has become a situation than ever done the right\n[noise] well yeah I think that the um the convention so he skipped the convention process uh you know he got onto the ballot by petitioning is way out to the Republican primary ballot\nSo he kind of kind of thumbed his nose that the the Connecticut Republican Party and in order to get to where he is and now that he's reached a point where he needs to party apparatus behind him he needs the support of the party\nUm you know he's needed to win over some people and uh he didn't know a lot of um [noise] the the politics of Connecticut and you know he wasn't in Connecticut for for a lot of years and he didn't vote for for sixteen years in Connecticut so\nUm Connecticut is a relatively new [laughter]\nWell again I'm again when he started to uh to campaign or way back and he has he has the same\nPerson that Ronald Reagan had when he ran for president you got that same person up behind him and I met him and I remember when uh when he came to town\nSo I thought you know that he would be a very strong and he is very strong as far as\nUh the the campaign goes but as you said you got to have the money\nYou got to have the money and you know I think that you know economists art Laffer a who is a health and put together his economic plan\nUm I you know it might have worked at the national level but in the state of Connecticut we have a balanced budget amendment and we have to balance our budget every year so\nYou can't carry over um any any deficit from year to year so it makes it a little bit tougher a to implement that\nWell again or then uh as far as Ned Lamont goes he's got plenty of money ... or could become somebody who is going to hurt somebody else so you know it's really up on the air\nIt really is it really is and and we said the you know\nQuinnipiac baby out with with another pull a probably towards the end of October so it should be interesting to see I mean inside pulls right now tell us the the races really close and you know it's possible we may not know it may be like two thousand ten where we don't know who they're with a winter is before we go to bed on November sex\nNed Lamont or even though he's got all\nTwo thousand ten where we don't know who they're with a winter is before we go to bed on November sex\nThen Ned Lamont or even though he's got all the money or is not a\nA sure thing definitely not a sure thing no [laughter] well it's going to be a\nI I Know I Know you're out a lot I'm go I you know I'm Out of talking with with people too and speaking to this one on that one when we go out on some of our appearances and uh I'll tell you\nPeople are not satisfied they are absolutely not satisfied now that doesn't mean that they know what to do\nSo uh I don't know what do you think\nRight I don't know if they're there is a good answer yet or you know it's tough I think that\nUm you know some as Claritin is that it really well at the Prescott Bush dinner you know it seems like she told\nBy seven ... you're going to have foreign miserable years [laughter] if ah if you get\nA Democratic House and a Democratic Senate so the legislature plays a big role in this too and there's a lot of tight legislative races around the state so and the numbers are close and the Senate and evenly divided Senate right now so I'm anything could happen\nWould you say though that a a Bob stepping al ... is a is the one who might win it\nUm in our attitude towards business were anti business we still one person wrote me and said did you know that I owe a thousand dollars and I'm going to pay it because I can afford it for my business because\nYou ... you have a business entity tax that two hundred and fifty dollars just to exist jets exist that's in addition to the corporate taxes to send ... property taxes than dish and to the income taxes they pay and because\nOf that um that two hundred and fifty dollars he owes a thousand and guess what the interest in addition is two hundred dollars and the penalty is five hundred dollar so you're talking in additional seven hundred dollars just because they have to pay just to exist as a business and this business entity tax\nMakes businesses furious and remember she didn't leave because it didn't happen\nUp people to hire ... left because the Finance Committee passed the unitary tax and they said if you pass this we're leaving and that's a new tax that will tax the business for any sales they make or do outside of the state of Connecticut they reach even outside of the state\nAnd we voted against that straight party line but the Democrats have the advantage in the numbers they have but guess what read\nIt's changing were tied Eighteen to Eighteen in the Senate and you know because of that in this last year we adopt a cell phone tax a new one we stop the new tax I'm tired we stopped new tax on a second home\nAnd we also stop the governor from sending a bill\nTo every town and city in Connecticut a four hundred million dollars of aid cost\nThat was rightfully the state's cloth not the town's club and that would have equated to an enormous huge property tax increase because then the same article that you're just reading about are terrible business climate it talked about how Connecticut ranks fifty out of fifty for its tax burden\nWell OK businesses where where we are at\nA there's no there's no question however however I also heard from very very good sources that no matter who gets the job they still have got to dig themselves out of this huge hole\nAnd can you do it by cutting taxes can you do it that way\nYou have to have a combination of reduction or at the start at least of a phase out on reduction of a lot of these ... you know business taxes and personal income taxes and state taxes\nUh you have to make a start but you have to also reduce the overhead and cost of government and you look at what various people are saying who are you going to believe bread that had been solidly supported by\nThe cost of government and look at what various people are saying who are you going to believe Brett that'll really that had been solidly supported by the state level you know in forming or those that are being supported by the business sector that are suffering\nWell I ah I hear a couple of uh a couple of candidates and or the one that did I hear the loudest right now and I'm Out there I go out a lot is a ...\nWell there's no question that he has come out strongly in support of the taxpayers and the business sector and everywhere I go no matter who I talk to men women\nA new people to Connecticut those that have been here the longest are at every age group they talk about the terrible\nEconomy that terrible job market the cost\nAnd on a forty ... of our state uh they are so concerned that their home values are dropping and they let me tell you home values are dropping while the rest of the country is improving and they drop because if you're trying to sell the house and their tax burden as hot they have to drop\nWhat the cost of their home would be what they're selling it for to make up for that additional taxes so they can sell their house I talked to someone that's we can uh they were going to New Hampshire and in fact New Hampshire is the one state in the northeast is actually\nGrowing on people going jobs because it had no income tax it has a you know very low other taxes and so many are also getting rid of their estate tax which is a huge disincentive for seniors to stay\nWell it is a it's going to be very very a very interesting and we had a big it was a big forum at the manual synagogue a yesterday did I I was at a very interesting\nVery interesting ... ah Ned Lamont and Bob the ...\nAnd they were all there and a big big crowd and to to listen and I talked to a lot of people\nAre it is a it is going to be as far as that meeting yesterday he was concerned if you listened very very close when they get to the ballot box\nOr here's the problem that we have in Connecticut we have um\nThis third party candidate of people and hit they know that can that there's no chance that they would ever win because they're probably around four percent but the one thing they can do is to have someone\nThat is wanting to cut taxes at you know have a bigger and harder challenge and one has to question you know are they really for improving Connecticut if they or they just there to be a spoiler and that's my biggest concern\nThere you know it it is certainly everyone's prerogative to run for office but in this case is it just being the spoiler\nAnd that's the final word nice thank you for calling me this morning thank you Brett\nYou bet thank you okay my friend's coming up to a quarter of the hour and a we're going to a a take a

business how about that and the senator good morning good morning\nOr good morning Brad yeah it's a great a great way to go out and dying in Connecticut especially those restaurants participating in Connecticut restaurant week\nNow how do you set this all up I've often wondered uh I've never gas but I've often wondered how do you do it\nHere so the any individual restaurant doesn't matter what size or can participate they connect with through the Connecticut restaurant association\nAnd they advertise and then you have a you can go anywhere ... percent milk price for twenty dollars in eighty nine tenths of a three course dinner um there's a ... about forty restaurants participating a ton of them in West Hartford\nI have two restaurants in my district went over and some very Abigail's and the north house in Avon they're participating in this and I went to a great way to raise awareness and also raises funds for ... for young people that are looking to get into the restaurant a management\nUm occupation\nEither you know I was often wanted to ask the question a senator and uh I did not know it'd be very honest with you I did not know that you were in their registered business before\nWe did my wife and I ran a restaurant for five years we just sold it two weeks ago oh you're\nKidding uh now I don't know where did you run into\nLike right in the hearing columns villas called Wilson's pub you know we had a fantastic wonderful experience and um [noise] uh uh one of our customers actually bought it for myself to carry on ... so it was a it was a labor of love but we so enjoyed the time and the people that we're not doing it\nWell that's what I Want to give it\nYou know I Want to give a shout out of the kind of restaurant association because\nUh a dollar of every one of those meals goes towards what's called pro start which are high school children that want to go to school for this type of a career\nIn Connecticut out of the Wilbur cross high school in New haven they won the national\nCompetition this year really and they were there were five girls and they each got five thousand dollars scholarships from the restaurant association another thousand dollar scholarship on top of that um Burger King and they're eligible to each receive up to a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd scholarships and participate in colleges if they choose to go there it's fantastic\nYou don't let me ask you a Kevin are there a lot of young people today that are thinking about or want to get into the restaurant business\nWell let's look at you know I I think so and you see so many how popular the food network is um and I think that just the way you know everybody has to eat and so you can do so much with\nA moving into the restaurant and hospitality a issue so I I think it's a it's a great career path for a lot of folks that don't know what they're going to be doing a\nGoing on and this starts at the high school level so it's absolutely wonderful now how crowded because high school how uh how old\nWere you when you decided that you wanted to get in the restaurant business\nWell I had my first job when I turned sixteen I worked at McDonalds corporation where a lot of my friends that was our first job and uh you know spent five and a half years in the restaurant business and then went off into law enforcement\nAnd then when I retired from one place and I said I might go back into the restaurant business again so I went back in front of the five years my fingers and do it\nAnd then when I retired from one place and I said I might go back into the restaurant business again\nSo I went back in front of the five years my senior curse and other than your wife worked with you she got side by side\nWould that's who represents a great story I didn't I I have to ... I I did not know that you were a that you were in that in that business this I think this is a great thing that they do every year to and how did you get the job this year\n[noise] [laughter] well you know I I think this is one of these um these uh venues that people are looking for something to do with this is the best time of year the the great weather that we're having a people want to be able to dying outside you know all of the wouldn't taps or part of this uh restaurant a week\nOr they can go on line to a restaurant or dot org to get the list of the participate in restaurants throughout the state and I think it's something that you know we should be more to hear executives who excellent restaurants\nNow you get a good ... I I've had one of these meals I've you know we eat and at one of these are the ones that I called them parties before like twenty dollars in Eighteen cents you get a tremendous tremendous amount of food\nYeah it's a set price so you you know you can't beat that and an an a dollar that goes to post art and let's let's make sure that we keep our you know pop up restaurant uh unfortunately I don't know if you recall but last year and the general assembly I'm a there was opposed to tax the restaurants had another one percent\nYes science to them and when she was awful I mean thank God for the Republicans were able to stop that because I imagine throwing on another one percent on top of your bill just because the state wants to take more money\nWell again ah this this is a terrific now is actually against going on the age of October right\nCorrect industry on today right it today there yeah and it really was and it runs like more of the AIDS yeah rents the on the whole week they can go on\nThe the restaurant dot org to get the whole list of uh what restaurants are participating\nWell that's the food business now\nWe've got something that I went to a a big one a yesterday or a big a big debate and again uh uh it's it's gonna be a very very close race there's no question in my mind about it very close\nWhat do you think\nI think it's going to be extremely close I think it's going to be a extremely late at night before we find out\nWhat's happening I don't know if you're aware but I as I've been going to my town halls getting a a list of folks that are question has to balance the town clerk's are very upset with an issue that happened with one of the uh the minority party or the liberty party\nOr they weren't on the ballots correctly or their their names weren't there so there are delayed and sending things out and so I think that's going to cause some turmoil but I think as far as the governor's race it's going to be extremely close\nAll three candidates all three I well I think that uh you know a ...\nAnd a lot to do that they'll they'll stay in the single digits so I don't know who will pull from whether they're going to pull from you know Lamont are pulled from stepping ...\nA tennis I Know that I\nI've heard people say to me a a a vote for a vote for Obama or a ... vote for something else so that that goes either way so I think that points both parties\nBut I think the governor's race as can be extremely close but people are talking about no more raising of taxes and I think yeah I'm ... continues with his monitor of you know I'm gonna cut taxes going to cut taxes I think he's going to eat out squeak it out\nI Do too that's who I'm picking yep yeah\nI mean we've we've been under democratic control um you know for the past eight years for all of the house the Senate\nAnd the governorship are we in the Republican side we haven't controlled chambers since the early nineties or we gave people a glimpse of what we can do as leaders to

you maybe you can hit me have you noticed that she will Republicans have grown those aren't ended up back on if you will\nStretch John McCain passed away Lindsey Graham which what Carl now Susan Collins is sort of obvious to me and I'm not putting John McCain down by any means I've just noticed in the republic Republican finally grown a backbone\nAnd it's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that is right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin up a prior to his death that I think if he had not a guide Neal if he if he'd been you know well and present and voting I think he would have supported a cabin uh [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always this big question mark yeah you know you never knew when he was going to go rogue and ... and abandoned his party I thought he was bigger than his party or\nAn ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after writing three or four times on a platform of abolishing all Obamacare evil or to keep it and as apparently he did that just out of spiked a because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways that I think over over his time and this that he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think that the the person with respect to what your theory might have the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham ... was always the junior maverick er he was always ah he was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain uh gone\nMay maybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moments\nOr thanks for that call re offend if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call you know I wrote a

as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that posted about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and we're I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd moved to conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that\nThis episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post where do we go from here or by saying this Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I paused there for a moment the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school student believable uh the smears that the the slander as they they directed against uh against judge Kavanaugh\nSo I continued uh about the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come\nAnd I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact that we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have more about a capital a nomination with John Malcolm\n[noise]\nSaid that he was evil and he was a liar and you know the people would die in the streets and so if one isn't going to get angry about that\nI'm not quite sure when when when we get angry and I am quite confident that if you had remained calm and robot like that the response would have been well clearly he must have done the things that he was accused of because somebody who was truly innocent would've been a ... that this would have shown that\nA by you know paid a little angry in responding to those charges so I really think the damned if you did\nAnd damned if he did it the fact that twenty four hundred a walk professors or you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens\nUm leaped into this when everything else failed horribly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that was going to have not the slightest a doubt that apply to examine that listed it will overwhelming urge you to the left\nAnd that's more a comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide turned in that in that follow up here and when when the cabinet on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these\nI think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that\nTo show people he he was he was sincere and I and I walk it that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford\nShe was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling person you may or may not think that she that Kavanaugh had done something to her but\nThe testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional\nAnd I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them he would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out ...\nAs strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way trying to destroy the judiciary bypassing doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served judges and I'm not going to play along with this I\nThink that he he very much help his uh his cause and had he come out and been had a flat aspect\nOr when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm I'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined\nAnd and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the prediction ah they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this\n[laughter] well I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact\nTrying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because it does involve the cell and more and more social issues that frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people\nBut you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with Peter Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving administration and called policies\nNobody was filing ... motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed of the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing at the beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh of who all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nA committee you know I impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of ... who they bulk or whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control of the house it is possible they might impeached by capping off it'd be very clear\nImpeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority\nIn the house of representatives after he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton\nAnd then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote\nIn the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the\nThe Democrats who showed up as as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices in it and then all of the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on but I asked myself why are they so crazed I mean it's really a kind of strange\nAnd I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that\nThere with with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court to um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what\nDo you think about that do you think there is a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh\nEver since ... election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will uh for folks are on the left have been predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one\nAnd that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to\nIt was every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court a starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one\nAnd that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to farm or wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter and the at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court\nA would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called roe versus Wade to be revisited overturned\nMy prediction if I had to had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be out like overturned than it will be that more restrictions placed on uh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's\nHow he tended to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states

back showing that has recently taken place and looking at the first amendment of the constitution award shows the right of the people\nWanted to stay as is the right of the people to peaceably peaceably too simple and petition the government for aggressive grievances everything that we've witnessed\nThe attacks going back to ... uh the attacks on other congressman the threats\nAre what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the attorney general where is the department of justice surely by now that are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nKnow there was a headline just this morning I I have not had time to follow up yet it up\nI think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up you know it I saw when I was on the air here where somebody I'm from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid to show up and engaging mob action in Washington in this this most recent go round\nYeah I don't know whether the geo Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to involve a violation of federal law this later would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing this stuff and\nSome kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I\nI Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got in chief of ...\nA rioting in your city smashing store fronts you know breaking up a places of business are hitting people over the head with baseball bats and um and the two by fours\nAnd and setting cars on fire you don't have to wait for a for for a sessions or the department of justice prosecute them arrest them put them in jail that if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book at him you know these people deserve law in jail terms\nA big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats and the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the\nKind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that's the that's the activist wing the militant wing of the Democratic party they don't want to prosecute them they don't want to put them in jail\nAnd uh so I think that's where the that's where the enforcement really needs to be done is at the state and local level or the crimes are taking place\nLet's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nOh hi thank you um do you remember what happened in two thousand eleven in Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give union members that choice public union members that choice in paying dues to remember the hundred thousand protesters by stairs\nOn ... or the country over the capital was terrible ... ... ...\nYeah they actually camped inside the state capital or they threatened\nA Republican legislators um they came to buses were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons a Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot\nAh there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about a Governor Scott Walker he was successful the Republican\n'cause Gerald brothers who control the state Senate and state assembly stood strong the governor stood strong and the book is called on intimidated\nAnd everything you're seeing now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin turn red\nThere was that attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuits everything you're seeing now\nUh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin I'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt\nA human way as you know the Democratic legislators ran and hid so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight man\nRight they hit out and of course the Tea Party exposed where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel it was just you know you couldn't carry on a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process and by the way organizing for America\nThe Wisconsin branch was a busy there that was Obama's group two thousand eleven ... in a while\nAnyway I'm sure you meant you make a great point I mean we we've seen this show before they previewed it in Wisconsin and the good news is a Walker one and and they made tremendous progress tremendous reforms in Wisconsin let's go to a Roland in North Carolina line six a welcome to the program\nJohn ... for taking my call\nOn sixty eight years old ... ah I haven't drank anything thirty some years but when I was in my late teens ... into my twenties when I was in ... in the navy [noise] we drank as much as we could possibly\nI like things in my twenties when I was in ... in the navy [noise] we drank or as much as we could possibly drink and you cannot blackout gr ranking American beer\nOn the last few or a I have a healthy [laughter] I don't know why nobody ever said we're all that up\n[laughter] that's very ... I you know uh I probably drug my share of American beer I guess I'll confirmed what you what you say I think it would be very difficult to ah to black\nOut from drinking beer I don't know maybe it's possible I certainly never a ...\nOh let's let's take one last caller Kevin in Florida I live on five job but I'm sure you've only got about thirty seconds quick point\nFor quick I I've I've watched the whole Brett Kavanaugh and ... or a but it kind of relates to a movie a series called Thirteen were reasons why everything that happened in that series\nA from the gang range to the drinking everything and it also happened to a very prominent kid in that are in that series\nI who knows you may be right we've got to go to a break we'll be joined by I guess Adam Michelle when we return\n[noise]\nAnd now a President Trump is really fulfilling his promises a to pursue policies that lift the middle class that left people all across America not just on the east coast in the west coast and in particular that give opportunity\nTo people starting out at the bottom of the totem pole it's really striking I think how successful his policies have been\n... I agree I think the way they are sort of as an economist I knew that uh that the tax reform was good for the economy that regulations where at where a drag on economic growth but ah it's been it's been incredible to see how\nHow transformative some of the reforms can be it a that just a A N reaching that the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is that is really a transformative across the board\nI had a really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking basis or a currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval of which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had 'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval and that's the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meeting that his approval index is\nRight now at zero doesn't that doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven so Trump said that this moment is eleven points better\nSo we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something\nElse ... what do you think Adam are they responding to the economy or they responded to the\nThe outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYou know I think it's a it's all the above it it's both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between the two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh\nThat that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan repealed Trump's tax\nCuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what needs but the average a tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax\nCuts that they would have asked last year and the economic growth projected over the future the tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of last take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that the\nThat that that that should be scared to to most Americans that that all of this process\nYeah that that sort of typical American can expect an accent\nThat that that that should be scared to to most Americans that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the uh with by simply repealing committees big pieces that at the at the house and then the ... and ... and have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House\nLawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions enemy stops to answer their questions and there's a bunch of questions about the cabinet nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he's talked about Venezuela\nAnd he said yeah if the Democrats get their way all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela and I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that\nThat rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just blindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\nIn the the the record of socialism and something like eighty six zero at the way it's been tried more times than it should have been and each and every time it's a it's it's crumbled and then left misery and destruction at wake and so I mean that's the that\nAt a very high level that those are the two that your direction we can shoot the promise of the tax\nCut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money and rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington letting it sort of lost around\nLine people's pockets and then or are they getting bad back out elsewhere that that that is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American and American businesses no how best to spend invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of\nOf individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American uh you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so I if you're part of the ruling click or you're you're a part of the end the socialist in crowd yeah you could do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they could fry 'em up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially toward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force it into the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs\nEnemies shell thank you very much for being on the program we appreciate it we've got to run to a break now we're gonna come back with your calls to the

of bounds we played and played and played and played and played\nRun in and out of each other's houses and one mom always have some lemonade one mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches or maybe it was a great neighborhood and I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man\nI Want to go to school he'll be cool to go to school when I can go to school\nI'll be happy than ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it I'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when I back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school\nAnd and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right and so you're like man I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be though I'd be ruined the school man\nI'll be happy there\nDog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be the I'd be ruined the school man I'll be happy then then you finally get\nThe sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was seven eight nine ... the school I went to and man if I could just get out of six gringo their middle school\n\nThank you for joining us America we're glad your hair but NASA and Miami, Florida Hi Vanessa how are you\nHave it on one that fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up until a few years ago a resigned our children are from Florida prepaid college\nPlan and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and since then our income has gone down and we added another child and we've gotten into San credit\nCard debt and they have a car loan now um we can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we pay off our debt and leave that money and continue contributing to their\nPre paid plan how much is in there [noise]\nUm about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand in what are you on your credit cards uh five thousand\nTime and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe just started at ... and that's and I realized we did that and he's got that an orderly having pizza pan pre played pan and then I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay I'm\nIn your household income is one [noise] um I had the next twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take on here um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um\nAnd um you do need to get on a budget and\nFollow through with what you're learning in financial ... and just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency or no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you pre pay something your rate of return is what it increases in\nPrice and so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars in increases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did\nThat in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right so that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time mind and so you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a is and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state\nMany many many of the state's\nBusiness\nGovernment are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return all my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition so all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip\nTwenty nine and a good mutual fund at some point right now I just stopped adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called a vacation\nBecause you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things\nAnd that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes with Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for for a a help I was going through a few for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil ... we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a tie mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money mhm uh over a million dollars [laughter]\nAnd we're deciding whether or not we should sell ... and cash out or\nHopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom ... and we want him out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh\nOil prices that sustain a drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling run out oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom you know what I mean but uh you know and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does own turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in\nA [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would because you might know more or your family might know more\nUh oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or what the it's it's simply [noise] uh they're looking at the three million for all the and the or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just handed on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking him as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling towns\nThat were deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within\nMy answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that okay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate\nAnd it's a little bit more predictable in less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights and west Texas where this is the answer is no then it's time to sell for the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with as getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well it might\nBut I I just started getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nWe hundred percent sure that you don't walk around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh\nSo what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so it was just down there they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right\nThen if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five percent of it okay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ...\nYou know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you\nIt struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty nine percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nMaybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nDefinitely not some advisors set of families entire portfolio three million dollar networks\nWe taught up as much [noise] um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me as a financial post as they do that I Would say that [noise]\nMoney off the tides\nThanks for calling ended [noise] good news to have a blessing like that so\nThis is the ... [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's more like a way to cover some of the costs of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income and our\nAssets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it and um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth\nAnd so there are toy and it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with them you know going in the\nYou know the the condo the other day we stopped and there are going to be on a condo over knocks when when the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich from then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHiring is today how you doing better than I deserve what's up in your life\nWhat methods have added of out\nIn the end of August I have a friend who has been following you and\nGave me some information and I had been struggling as a single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march\nAnd I and I'm like I make enough income but it's like I don't have any money left over to ten my groceries I put gas in my car and I were a pretty good ways away from home and I have\nTwo boys one in high school who then sports than very active in a son who's in a high

three thousand and let me just everything is not adding out and you know what you saw how much is your house payment\nI pay a hundred a month for rent okay and how much is your car payment to Ninety two a month okay unless you own a car and have a thousand less so\nThat's not bad but your your take home page three thousand us thirty six thousand a year so that means you're only making about forty five thousand before taxes as on right\nNow I'm at each paycheck is about and then some and so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I did about nine Ninety two in Chapel Hill about three thousand you owe them an income\nOr a little over three okay yes there are well you don't have a lot of wiggle room heroes and two boys um ... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills\nWhat that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget where every dollar but for the month again you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be for this month before the month begins and your son every dollar\nAnd so we would start with the ... off the top you said your toddler med school and that's the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that ties is done now when we go next well we're going to eat so second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your lights in your water\nAnd you do you eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your lights in your water okay then what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and\nLights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch okay and you probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations correct there give or take ... right I don't know what you want an hour and they don't even have that much left over food um\nBut you know you probably got twelve hundred maybe but let's just call it a thousand you know after you just your run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus much ... minus ... minus ah my my uh food bit budget what am I set up for food and a\nMinus ... minus my lights and water\nNow I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else out now we've got by a car payment or they're going to report that thing\nAnd we got to put gas in the car now

question\nUm uh we uh my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to\nUh we've got about Ninety thousand in that and we currently have a three vehicles two of them on line that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nOutcome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use once per week to call a trailer her car she is a it was about eleven thousand on and it ... percent interest [laughter]\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [laughter]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we should we keep it because it's ... percent of\n... the zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off what are all three of these cars ...\n[noise] I'm of the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things was motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay you're not violating that though so we are good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand\nGood and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but rather that includes the car the car you know in what is the Ninety thousand on mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff um medical bills\nEight to five five to to buy a new job and we'll talk about your life and your money Taylor is with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise] good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all things somewhat her for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I just had a question regarding retirement and college one of my one year old ...\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby stuff for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars in cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on [laughter] I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought\nIt I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it but I have no equity\nIn it um and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old\nCollege fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a chip five twenty nine I think for him in and\nTaking out some stock mutual fund\nTo I don't know if you were goes from there okay um so my question is one are kind of my what do I do with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses her for um you know every any given mom because about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only\nIncome right now I'm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of a set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the red should should draw towards my how we owned a little bit every year or should I put it someplace\nWe teach trailer is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation that is you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first went to the second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was ...\nThe planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm [laughter] and that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case and so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is\nPutting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a any tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well is that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent is a Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is on a kind of a bubble and high hundred\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a person that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to mark vast or Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro\nLink and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business so I don't care what you do okay doesn't affect my income at all but people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread ... personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a fourth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that\nYou could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there\nI'm ... and then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in ... in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your too rough IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh\nAny extra money I come into and throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's maybe step six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy or which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget on those keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right [noise]\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand in that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal it currently with a U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been a just an old from a service academy or three years ago um and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal\nThe um it as a result of having been a just an old from a service academy or three years ago um and the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I told you for a while um should I continue paying off as small as that first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I\nAsk is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know her back that will eventually end up in a collection the count if I'm not able to pay the amount of people\nUm you know um and what is your income now so\nIt varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be a year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWhile so you learn to you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start doing twenty thirty thousand bucks this thing or if it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nIs are so little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either after the third through and lip service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death\nUm and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving as an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven [noise]\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nAnd so like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nEver has you know but it can happen and can I have no choice on what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime\nAnd plugged into counseling she has to want to be well yeah and if she does that then she can form a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things\nYou are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself off of of her checking account because\nHeart when I got ... more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case yeah so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of internally\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do now that was yeah\nI've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go in the seat again\nThat to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go to the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy yeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the ... worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff\nBut I don't know if she does she go hit the bridge every time man\nAnd be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and and it's just I'm ... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating for the people that have\nIt and those that love them\nBut the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only the Medicaid but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicating\n... you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their lives\nAs I Know I mean they add controlled or she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen uh as as as him I really mentally ill and she is with she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nWell her ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\n... can happen yeah and it happens to people all the time the what did she say right now when they call her on ... do you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nIt out you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should be\nTelling them to be either one of the American long conversation it's gotten up and you get nothing because all they're going to ... her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and I aren't going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months out of their their during aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not given or any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds or you can hear the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people go collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there hey look at the Kennedy work at a deal yeah or you know are they\nAre Thirteen hundred bucks you ever seen any money in two years from now back up and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that the settlement and full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a film industry\nSo you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are they got really tender covering person here who's going into a rattlesnake being after she starts making some money you got a warm weather emotionally on this\nOr you can you can give her the cheerleading ... days without giving your money and I think you're the rice do all of that there's good news show she can make it out if she makes good choices [noise]\n\n\n\nOkay things are getting ... out there I

I deserve votes up\nHey I'm I'm In Davis deck and I've been paid on about twenty thousand dollars on my grandma and on I was just curious if you think that I should add that\nI'm In an upgrade my house or if I should just play it all down on my\nMortgage I I Know he's calculator on line and it's really about like I had a man and I do want to make sure that I sent me a little bit of that money out of it while it's going to go ahead and for our you know I just want to add\nTo what your homework I write about what do you want it on and to ... one of the homes on your street so far on average\nI'm Out of there okay All right so you're right it's a barely at the top of the market right yeah I read it that we're living yours is yours is not like double the average house on the street but it's one of the nicest launch\nExcept their home they saved up their emergency fund up three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house we want to take her two young children to Disney World you're should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you I mean you're stuck\nBecause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy if I did either one will be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures one of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go\nSecond one is you want to spend one month so that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty either way but I'll tell you what I Would do I go to Disney\nYeah little kids\nPart is perfect age for that um if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there I had a wonderful time\nNot sure how ready time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm now a but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals\nBut I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life you live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans\nTill you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six and purchases\nAre in there all at the same time baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some for your kid's college in five and six is when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that's what you're working towards the middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something and slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give money\nPiled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it is good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey have a they pay you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd die or received like Marshall helicopters they typically um however I unfortunately I Need a the by eighty hours or more training I've I discovered a the industry is highly regulated by insurance\nAnd an orderly comment sure why NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to\nFigure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot the hours\nBut now I unfortunately a day or a job I have a single pilot\nThat moment you just said the wrong thing you said the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... it's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice this is kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off and then\nAnd that's a that's why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the ... the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nI Know I Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make ...\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYeah yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd show it forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work and their regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nCentral that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value yeah\n... it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like I'm like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I I just\nI feel I'm I'm too far and to to just\nSuggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow there's not going to find the time to do their hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done me up and they don't charge not worth that much there it doesn't pay that much either and that's what I mean\nThey're not worth that last compared to what you're saying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you've got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours and the co pilot seat and get some gumption landings and get a job that counts ...\nOr ... those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently\nFind a Robin ... aircraft gotcha not even turbine yet but um I mean I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those are Jerry ...\nAnd unfortunately a lot of those guys are very busy\nThough yeah I can get and our air and our there but nothing really calm and\nTo do you're going to end up paying for these hours for dessert to eighty hours cost\nWell considering some of the hour and a burst of a you know on the cheap you can get 'em at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know you won a thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue to in the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely ... yeah why not I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah\nI mean I I've got a I I collect ... and shoot them a lot and uh and and also I burn through some MOH but it's a power don't make any money doing um I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one was not going to cost you money is actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks under this thirty thousand much of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking\nFor a power that you know with that much intensity or sometimes are unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nSo that helps interesting discussion [noise] interesting [noise]\nThis is the day Ramsey show\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis is I did not think we made this much and we can do this yeah it does\nGive you hope done at the podium you sit down and you kind of have that moment feel like I got a raise I Know this for sure\nAnd now we're like we're on we just started step for last

a\nHurricane Michael is just the hurricane just a category one with maximum sustained winds at Seventy five miles an hour the\nDirection is are heading north at seven miles an hour or so they expect them to pick up speed and also intensify as they expected to turn into a category two and then into a category three\nAt landfall around Panama City Florida so uh I have that picture in my stomach for all of my listeners in the Florida Panhandle uh especially around Panama City uh please please please prepare\nAnd again as a category one just at a Seventy five miles an hour it's just the cat and one 'cause a\nHurricane category one begins at a maximum sustained winds at Seventy four miles an hour but it's going to intensify according to the hurricane experts so we'll get into this little bit later on on this limo crash in New York state I mean this is just an unbelievable story\nWhen you think about twenty people that were killed I mean it's just it's it's hard to to grass vis a two thousand one for the excursion\nModified stretch limo so they took an old Ford excursion that was that really really big super size the Ford Expedition the other giant one which I I think Ford stop making that somewhat five six years ago so\nMaybe a little less but I don't think Ford maybe they'll make the excursion any longer or to the best of my knowledge so you had a a party and uh I mean it's just so many events that are just terrible they were supposed to be in a shuttle bus\nAnd apparently there was an issue with the shuttle bus and then they were booked him is this for an excursion limousine Eighteen people in this limousine not aid to people\nEnough in this stretch ... first of all when they take these vehicles whether it's a an SUV or they take a Cadillac sort of Lincoln's and they ...\nThey they don't have the same structural integrity in many cases they don't have the safety features they don't have the airbags curtain airbags indoor air bags and a lot of times if you're in an accident of these vehicles that they could be absolute death traps\nBut what's important here a couple of things they were not supposed to be in this vehicle to begin with turns out it's some kind of like a rattle trap bucking bulls on wheels and in fact this is what's an awful\nLot of the victims prior to the crash\nActually tweeted a message\nThat the limousine they were in was in quote terrible condition and it was a replacement because the rent the shuttle bus the party buses that they were supposed to be in had broken down and this was the replacement vehicle but to to hear that\nOne of those deceased on him and his vehicle actually on social media [noise]\nUh\nActually I'm a there was a text message I thought it was a tweet but I guess it's a it's a text message that the the vehicle was in terrible conditions well you know don't don't get ...\nYeah I Know that it's a little too little too late for them we have the mistake that so many people lay people off guard and I'll tell you that in the second when we get back the next show\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's\nPremier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from

years back Bob Simon\nIn the back of one of those black cars you know the Lincoln town car services and he was in an accident he was in the backseat didn't have a seat belt on why is it the people that there is a full sense\nThan an accident he was a back seat didn't have a seat belt on\nWhy is it that people they there's a false sense of security when you ride on the back but especially I feel that when people get in to liberate cars taxis or over type vehicles limos that oh I Want changes\nWhen you get in your car in the front seat or the passenger seat buckle up most people buckle up but there is this this this dropping of people's guard when they get into certain vehicles and\nI was mentioned Bob Simon from CBS News he got into a a one of these black car limos\nOr you know one of these you know for a Lincoln town cars style of vehicles and there was an accident on the west side highway in New York City in Manhattan and he wasn't built to them and he he died blunt force trauma he died because he became a ping pong ball inside\nThe vehicle the driver who I Believe how to see the driver of the car was fine\nI I just implore you please if you ride in a limo a car service what taxi and you're in the backseat put your seatbelt on whenever I'm In the vehicles are of that nature with my wife my kids I first thing I say seatbelts on I double check\nBecause there's this again\nFalse sense that oh nothing's going to happen and something happened and I'm going to guess that is going to come out that this for an excursion stretch limousine accident up in New York state with a Eighteen people dead inside I'm going to guess that the passengers in the back\nEither there or not enough seatbelt or working seatbelts or they did not have seatbelts on even if it were an option\nI Want a horrific tragedy Kennedy scale the and this is what blows my mind is that the NTSB is comparing that limo crash in New York state\nTo the last ... mass casualty\nTransportation crash it was that Colgan Air crash outside of buffalo where I'd dashed ada acute four hundred dash shaped a airplane a proper a turbo prop crashed\nInto a house on approach into the buffalo airport that was two thousand nine were around fifty die and I think one person on the ground died and then everyone on the airplane die and it was a Colgan Air it was operating is United Express it was a flight from Newark international liberty or to buffalo\nAnd don't get me started on that crash\n'cause I mean the inexperienced crew did everything wrong when they were stalling they pulled up when in fact\nYou push down on a stick you get air speed to get out of the stall you don't pull up that that that yeah that makes the soil even worse and they were doing they went into a corkscrew in right into the ground but the point is the MPs me to put things into perspective isn't the deadliest transportation crash\nWhether it's air whether it's rare boss a vehicle since two thousand nine with Eighteen people dead\nIn his vehicle and then two on the ground to air in a parking lot department or prospect there was a plane crash\nThat had the ... next to you know have that have the highest death toll and this goes back to two thousand nine just absolutely unbelievable uh folks let's get back in a cabin on for a minute here but please buckle up if my Smith public service good deed announcement of the day please\nBuckle up now on to cabinet as I promised I wanted to go back to immigrants of calls here and just a bit and then the the victory all the venom I've got a pile of poison I'm hoping to get at this hour if not it'll be an hour and number two\nUh but I've got a a an a capital a pile of poison\nThose opposed the Kavanaugh so I Want to get into that and just the ... and you know I I watching the confirmation vote on Saturday afternoon and and the protests I mean it was like a daisy chain of of ... of shrill screaming ...\nIt was deliberate from different parts of the chamber as these coat paint type protesters got him\nAnd the vote kept getting interrupted on Saturday afternoon with this this Banshee type screaming\nYou know screaming and yelling so ah what are you on the ground oh are you know I Will do that\nHang on a sec ah George is on the line calling from New York City Georgia's a license limo driver let me before you go to Kevin let me grab this call because George being a license limo driver I'm sure has something to say about this horrific crash George welcome to Schmidt height\nPoint yet at the Capitol let me grab this call because George being a license limo driver I'm sure has something to say about this horrific crash George welcome to Schmidt Hi\nHi how are you as a ... until November twenty Seventeen we were not legally required as drivers to wear seatbelts and the car\n'em knowing where the passengers a into in November twenty Seventeen the law was changed and or the New York or traffic a vehicle code was change so that was a violation not to wear them\nUm there's a presumption on the part of the writing public that they're going to be safe because they're being driven by a professional\nAnd um so typically they're correct I'm\nIn New York City taxi cabs and limousines get into very few fatal accidents over so um [noise] that's correct but everybody should buckle up as you said more importantly um most of these cabs I'm should have the airbags operational for the back seat\nOf some of them with the petitions do not\nWhat are your thoughts when you heard that this was a two thousand one for the excursion modified strength through\nVehicle that old should that be on the road\nAre maintained that will be fine that's no problem or you know the problem with this intersection is is that there were a three semi trailer truck accidents that occurred there as well uh in which they went through the parking lot of this uh particular restaurant or a\nA shopping center and the result in crashes now a tractor trailers are driven by people have commercial driver's licenses Taipei and they also have air brakes\nAnd apparently a this intersection and so dangerous that air brakes on a tractor trailer couldn't stop it so I mean even if the car was a um a twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen a vehicle um it could very well be that it couldn't have stopped at the intersection because of the design of the roadway\nYeah but also the governor of New York said that this limo and recently failed inspection this excursion should not have been on the road plus the driver didn't have the proper endorsement didn't have the right didn't have a little license\nWhile he actually has to have a commercial driver's license because he has more than fourteen passengers\nYou have to have a commercial driver's license see or commercial driver's license be in New York state law and order to transport that large or a group of people\nAre there are some drawbacks to having a converted car made into a stretch limousine namely the fact that you don't have air brakes you're dependent upon hydraulic braking systems that may or may not be ... argument that there's a way to augment the uh the driving system in medium duty trucks which involves\nUsing the power steering pumped to power a\nA a booster to the um [noise] hydraulic braking system that's on the car\nOr truck\nAnd are most likely this was not present um so you know I I ... that that resulted in the result that in the ah ... ah George\n... when I'm when I'm getting here is that you know what you're talking about the his you certainly seemed to have a whole lot of experience and this is just heartbreaking story the here that are in a married couples you know you have kids that are ... I mean just it's an unbelievably tragic story and\nThat I'm sure there's going to be ah I mean when the NTSB is called in for a class like this it tells you the the serious nature George thanks for your input I I Do appreciate it\nYou're walking but I think it's almost fault why do you think it's Cuomo's fault\nOr because he spends millions of dollars on signs on highways are naming bridges after his father you know and not a dime for for a traffic light at the center section or some sort of mediating traffic device that might have a a forestall the prevented this accident\nSure there's going to be fully investigated the NTSB again involves there'll be a full report on any of those culpable in this crash\nGeorge thanks for the call I appreciate it back over the Kavanaugh and I wanted to grab that call because it was very relevant to what I was just discussing so as you know a Brett Kavanaugh has\nBeen converted a confirmed on Saturday and I'm just looking at at some of the numbers in years gone by which really is fascinating so if I had I watch this I Know that a lot of the country was glued to the television to watch uh this historic vote\nOn a Saturday a and of course this is a a totally divided Senate or along party lines for the most part a fifty to forty eight votes to confirm Kavanaugh yeah it doesn't add up to a hundred\nYou had the Republican Steve Gaines who we told you was going to be walking his daughter down the aisle\nTalk of Connecticut WBRC AM dial it Thirteen fifty six ten and fourteen\nTune in radio app on your smartphone or online twenty four seven at talk of Connecticut dot com\n\nLittle league [noise]\nRunning down memory lane music professor operate at all or most every member of our legendary ... have\nThe the effects weekends from six to ten the best in the fifties sixties and seventies would love to use a professor Robert Blake told me all the talk of the our sci am WBRC FM HD threes Hartford W s n G ...

county split on fifty first state initiative and that was November of twenty Thirteen\nOr five years ago there that's that's that's why I Try to remember we talked about it on the program has been five years\nSince that wow that's incredible I let's finish up with my my Kavanaugh poison pile here the follow up on the Georgetown professor and this was just vile there was at Georgetown\nProfessor in Washington DC who wish miserable death saw Republicans and wanted the G O P male senators to beat cash paraded\nAround folks\nWe might have some justice here at at least it seems like a good decision was made in what is mostly liberal academia\nTurns out that Georgetown University has this ...\nThis female professor because of her tweet where she said that Republican senators who support Brett Kavanaugh Trump's nominee ought to be killed and cash graded isn't that lovely\nHow is fat for tolerance isn't that killed and cash grade\nThat's just so warm and it's just you know\nArm the liberal embrace isn't that just phenomenal Carol Christine fair\nWho is called a distinguished associate professor within the school of foreign service\nAnd Washington D.C.'s Georgetown University is according to the Washington Examiner willing stand travel internationally for university research instead of teaching\nSo there was a swift and decisive move from\nGeorgetown because of this completely irrational insensitive vial and grotesque tweet\nTo prevent further disruption to her students and out of an abundance of caution for the security of our community we have mutually agree for professor fair to go on research leave affective immediately it's according to the foreign service school dean ... held ...\nBring up the hill ovens and bring out the best he wrote this in a statement to staff according to the Washington Examiner they were quoting Fox News professor farewell\nAccelerate previously scheduled International Research travel so let's give this great so apparently she was getting ready to travel for research ah\nAcademic work but they accelerate it it sounded like they bumped sucker up numerous semesters or maybe a year or two who the hell knows we can and strong\nEthnic work but they celebrated it sounded like they bumped sucker up numerous semesters or maybe a year or two who the hell knows we can and strongly condemn the use of violent imagery profanity\nAnd insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of this course\nHelmut roads so you know what there is hope\nThat a\nLiberal academia and they have recognized that this professor wishing dance and cast ration two Republican senators supporting Kavanaugh that the school said this is inappropriate and were essentially give ban\nIssue when it's actually going to put you out to pasture or are we going to send you off or get a you know lock you up in the attic\nAnd getting a locked up in the advocate ... means that they're going to send their off on her research traveled overseas [laughter] so sabbatical right [laughter] [laughter] uh I mean\nWe talked about this last week when I when I saw the story that she was dancing cash gracious so you know I have\nTo hand it to Georgetown University and the fact that they they moved swiftly and the fact is that while they they probably don't want a candidate on either\nAnd is this theme\nOf this or what the foreign service school deem as Joel how am I I'm guessing he wasn't a cabinet fan either probably didn't want cabinet confer but it just shows that there is there is some help here that they can recognize that I'm assuming one of their own\nOverstepped their boundaries see you got to keep that to yourself", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show",
