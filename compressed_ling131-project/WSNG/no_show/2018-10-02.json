never asked about how much alcohol she drank with her ... she was blacked out there the remember\nThe summit but uh I think they were trying to hand over such kitten glove they don't want to look bad in okay that's fine so maybe they already know something is going to come out in the FBI investigation to prove their point and they don't have to be the a devil by bringing this to wait for\nThe uh

know what I vote only been listening for about a forty five minutes less than our cars I Choose you then when I started driving home from work\n[noise] I spoke about this I was the last hour I think it was last hour there is a a journalist by the name of D.C McAllister and\nShe can for each call I heard that part and yeah yeah you see something\nOn Saturday but I Do something like this on Twitter on friday actually\nYeah but the point is though is she claims D.C McAllister who writes for PJ Media\nAnd she's a conservative writer again this is a woman she on Saturday put out a tweet\nAnd the relevance here is the fact that she claims that she went to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill with Christine Blasey Ford the capital accuser says she's claiming that she was there\nAnd she offered up this this question regarding her character and\nFor those that are didn't hear this this D.C McAllister we put the clean up on the short list so it's on today snip list at\n... dot com but she put out this tweet on Saturday that says Christine Blasey Ford was a classmate of mine and UNC we graduated in Nineteen eighty eight I Want to ask\nChristine if she remembers partying at trolls drinking and he's not here hooking up with guys that hinders inch screen eating a timeout remember those days Christine Tell us about them so clearly this D.C McAllister is being snarky in the delivery and suggesting that\nUh maybe Christine Blasey Ford and her history is not all Snow White and ... and daisies et cetera and again I think she's coming from the standpoint that you have cabin on it's been accused of all kinds of horrific actions here\nAnd she's suggesting listen what's fair is fair let's talk about the history in the background of the accuser and this is from a female perspective who is claiming to have knowledge about our behavior back and UNC in Nineteen eighty eight in North Carolina ...\n... absolutely and the costs of examination was a very light in nobody pushed her on these issues and I thought that kind of odd I mean if she was to take this to court it would be a very harshly poll a push back and they would\nCross examined her character not one person who did that during that Senate confirmation\nWell again you have to be careful of optics and you know that's the reason why\nI'm looking at All right you guys here you go you weren't we're not going to bring the optics outlet to come out in the FBI investigation well I think is actually a smart move in a pun intended\nAnd here you go you weren't we're not going to bring the optics outlet to come out and the FBI investigation well I think it's actually a smart move in a pun intended it might be their Trump Card\nWell Jason is just the fact that they brought in the female or six times crimes prosecutor from ah Arizona to handle the Republican questioning because of the optics of you know eleven white guys you know quizzing or Dr Ford and I was also part of the optics there and in fact\nI this is also getting plenty of play over the weekend in that the prosecutor\nVis a vis a woman I'm Rachel Mitchell was her name she has said that the burden of proof just would not rise to the level of a a prosecution that with what information she sees as a prosecutor that\nShe could not bring a case so the woman the woman who questioned\nFor for the Republicans a will respect in sex crimes prosecutor for Maricopa County out in Arizona in the Phoenix area so that was what we have here there's no way that I could even prosecuted crime here that I wouldn't even move forward and of course the Democrats in our attacking\nHer saying oh she's a partisan she's a registered Republican and\nThat was that I don't think that you would compromise or integrity and again her see their background speaks for itself thanks for the call Jason appreciate it from Las Vegas Nevada let's go to North Carolina Joe is in Charlotte Joe you're on Schmidt Hi\nHi how are you doing it I'm doing fine go ahead I just so sick and tired of these Hollywood liberal activists being the moral authority on the situation I mean Hollywood is is a sense of that foreign license women for for you even marijuana one road comments that how it was a giant for awful and\nTheir and their sins or just covered up and buried and never talk about you mean to tell me when Democrats take money hand over fist from Hollywood they knew Weinstein wasn't raping young starving actresses\nAnd and they're taking money from not reporting the news won't reporter coverage Saturday Night live won't even spoof it protecting them\nI mean give me a break to my knowledge rose McGowan ever found a job since she was Harvey Weinstein of rape her I don't think so I could be wrong there it's a joke and they're going to tell and they're going to judge Brett Kavanaugh all these people who let these things go on and on and on and look\nYou know what people really feel sorry for like a list for more on them because you cannot tell me she was a child actors beautiful girl you can not tell me she was not\nViolated at the end of a fall we would mogul and cannot say a word about her career with the over the only power she has is to attack Brett Kavanaugh for cheese helpless she's that that don't seem to Hollywood if if she signed out her\nAbuser she never work again and it's this sense pool and they're allowed to run their mouth and run their TV shows and I had a Republican and no pushback\nNot in the media not anywhere and so it is all part of our country I think we should chop off that part of the treasury unsettling to the Pacific ocean [laughter] something to go out on a feel\nThe hypocrisy obviously has been raging for many many years\nAnd do as I say not as I Do try to act\nIs moral compasses and moral authorities while you know some of the material they are obviously a push out you know it was and gun control you know there's the push for guns well there's lots of violent Hollywood movies and it's again it's do as I say not as I Do and that\nHas been unbelievably uh uh the hypocrisy has been studying for many many years there and\nThen again with the me too movement and\nI'm sure many further their careers and they shouldn't speak out and I don't think all have\nAnd you know you saw less a mulatto obviously at the Capitol hearing you almost trying too hard to be seen and and if she saw that maybe she was being covered up on the monitor that must have been visible she was moving so she could be seen thanks for the call John appreciate it I I appreciate your

North America to take advantage of the uh the no terror if ah that that a nap to use to supply that the\nUS MCA now now supplies farmers um are going to benefit from it\nA particular way up in Wisconsin with a more dairy being able and we're not more able to export more dairy into Canada which they'd had big restrictions on that before this even you know the wine growers in in liberal California are going to have an easier time someone in line in British Columbia\nAnd the NFL which hasn't exactly been a big fan of Donald Trump's up to now is going to be able to uh sell advertising in Canada which it previously prior to disagreement\nThe NFL could only show ads that it had shown in the United states and Canada so lost a big revenue opportunity that's not going to be gone they're going to be able to make money up there so\nIt's really a benefit for a broad swath of the American business community and an American workers\nSandy we're going to have Molson uh most most a nail ads running in in during NFL games or something along those lines\nIt wouldn't surprise me at all I mean if the games are popular up there I'm sure that uh the um the the the products that are most popular with Canadians will not want to buy\nAn space a during NFL games and that's a that's a benefit to the NFL I said this was\nThis was a deal that cut across political lines so and in Mexico the unions love the deal in Mexico because it's requiring that I think it's twenty five percent of every car be built by people that are making at least sixteen dollars an hour and it opened up\nThe um opportunities for Mexicans to unionize so this is a I I you know nobody should be criticized industrial just says a great deal that it meets a commitment that President Trump made that certainly absolutely shows as many of us have been saying that\nHe wasn't trying to impose terrorists to destroy free trade he was trying to make a make a trade ... by making it fairer and are in this deal does\nThat look in the in the ... part of the afternoon of Monday right after the deal's been done they say the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place do you expect those to go away or at least be substantially modified or is there a reason there are still in place and they didn't go away automatically when this was done\nI I wouldn't be surprised if ah if there were some exceptions made for Canadian steel obviously candidate doesn't doesn't pose a national security threat to the United states\nNow there may be some qualifications put in that with respect to whether or not they could sell steal but they imported as opposed to steal their manufacturing in Canada but I I wouldn't be surprised to see that but\nThis agreement does not contemplate that a candidate was in a quarter in negotiating disagreement and uh I think the president got just about everything he wanted a from the Canadians and from the Mexicans as well\nJust answering a strong negotiating position something that I don't think other presidents either perceived or we're willing to take the risk the political risks of abusing the power they had in these negotiations\nFrom talking to Andy poster who's who was the first nominee to head the U.S department of labor\nAnd author of the capital's comeback can you talk at all about the increased intellectual property protections in this because as I understand that's one of those details that may not be sexy to people ah but but it's tremendously\nImportant when it comes to dealing not only with our allies like Mexico and Canada but dealing with some real antagonistic folks like the Chinese\nWell it's it's it it was important with respect to Mexico and Canada we always want to make sure that our intellectual property is protected as well outside the United states as it is inside the United states but with Canada and Mexico that wasn't as big a problem with Canada and Mexico I think the bigger deal was updating\nOr the ID laws when it came to to digital sales are things that have developed since the early Nineteen nineties uh when when after was originally passed with China this is a huge issue China\nDoes everything it possibly can to steal American technology I'm done that\nIt's on that for many many years there was a study by an independent commission here in the United states\nA congressional commission or that determined that they've done everything they can espionage wise and uh I'd write dumped wise to seal or intellectual property we did the company that used to run did business in China even a fast food restaurant company like ours to open franchise restaurants in\nIn ... in Shanghai we had to get\nA Chinese partner and you'll have a partner there they're exposed to everything you know no we didn't have a big trade secrets that the Chinese would have wanted but any country any company that went in to try and I had to bring in\nA Chinese partners and often was required to disclose intellectual property I'm just to do business in China which is grossly unfair and one of the things that I Am absolutely\nOften was required to disclose intellectual property I'm just to do business in China which is grossly unfair and one of the things that I Am absolutely confident after the election\nOf President Trump will be able to resolve I don't think we're going to see any progress with Europe and China pending the election\nOf because there is no upside for China and Europe to negotiate a deal before the election they think the president may may lose some power\nAfter the election if the Republicans are unable to hold the house are unable to hold the Senate and if they canceled either one of them is going to be spending more time arguing with a with the Democrats about impeachment than he is negotiating better trade deals which would be a tragedy for the United states in American workers so I'm hoping Republicans will\nStay in power and then after the election I think will get better trade deals\nYou know you would think Andy this is one of those things that Democrats and Republicans from time to time will say this is a bipartisan issue like national\nSecurity is bipartisan but the different sides see different solutions to different problems\nWhy do you suppose it is that Republicans are so much more concerned about say protecting things like intellectual property then the Democrats seem to be because it does have entered a dramatic effect on uh on on jobs I remember there was one company that had it's a a software and technology for controllers for windmills ripped off\nAnd they had a thousand people working for them in the United states and they almost one out of business so theft of intellectual property could've built a thousand people in the bricks that that should be something that transcends ideological barriers in the United states shouldn't\nIt it it should and to some extent it does we had Chuck Schumer um and and Elizabeth Warren both actually I have been somewhat supportive of the president on this and they got Warren told CNN\nThat she thought president from putting terrorists on the table with respect to try and it was a good idea should be part of the trade policy uh humor to achieve what it was very I write about he said China takes total advantage of the United states such deals are real actual property using ... cyber theft ease\nThe ... that they are more aligned with President Trump on this issue than they are with others but I I tell you what I can uh I'd be very surprised if either of ... anything good to say about anything he negotiates I'm sure they look for whatever vulnerability they could find in the agreement because\nWe're we're to the point where anything that President Trump wants to do even if it's things they show learn Warren and other Democrats support they're going to criticize it just because it's President Trump\nA day which is one of the reasons rapping such a hard time moving forward in this country a with things that have to go through Congress up at the president seems to be getting a lot done despite that opposition so I I think we'll see continued progress\nYou know Andy uh do you think on an entirely different matter in the last thirty second to got are we going to have a nine to ... the Supreme Court justice by the end of the week\nTwo masters a bachelor's degree but she can't remember much oil was crap you know that was required to pass the testing of fraud to get all those degrees you can't remember jak but she can ... ... ... or\nThe specifics for the most devastating events she ever had in our lifetime she can't remember how she dies there or how she got home I mean it's like there's a lot of holes in this woman's case that anything I can ever imagine\nI Can't help but feel that I think if you invest the gate\nThe series of how she probably was coast going into last week and everything this find out that this was completely uh scammed by the Democrats which leads to my second point why\nAre they not help the civil and criminal criminal penalties for marrying the good name a judge Kavanaugh\nWell first of all there is no criminal penalty for smearing somebody that I Know of\nAlthough I guess you could say the so called hate crimes are at a an effort to do it at a very low level where if you use certain kinds of words you could be charged with a crime\nOn the civil side somebody could suit Dianne Feinstein or Feinstein is the president likes to color or they could sewer for defamation the problem is when you're suing somebody who's a a public figure and if you happen to be a public figure as well\nAnd I think that Christine forwarded this point would be judged a public figure it becomes exceedingly hard to bring any kind of lawsuit you'd have to prove that a sort of Brett Kavanaugh one or to bring a suit against Dianne Feinstein\nHe'd have to prove that what she said was untrue number one number two that she knew it was untrue when she said that because he is a public figure and number three that she had\nActual malice that she said I'm In\nThat she knew it was untrue when she said because he is a public figure and number three the tree had\nActual malice that she said I'm going to get this guy was even if I have to lie about it and I'm going to say things that aren't true and I think you'd also lose out because\nIn most defamation law but I'm aware of because as a reporter I've had to deal with lawyers for for like Thirty years on defamation laws when it comes to a public figure you have to show that you've actually suffered two dollar damage is not just that you lost out on being a Supreme Court member\nWhich you know usually pays less than what the private sector would you I don't think you'd be able to show dollar damages\nYou wouldn't be able to prove that she knew it was untrue when she said it uh and in fact\nHow would you even go about saying that what Christine Ford is proven bully on true and and that means provable in court by a preponderance of the oven and first of all one of the biggest problems is proving something didn't happen because\nYou know I could I could say to you I could prove various things that I Do but how do I proved the things I never did or disprove the idea that I did them that that did heart in almost all cases so they're almost used in a civil or criminal solution to that and so and the Democrats know that\nThey're using it to full advantage let's go to Debbie Debbie welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind\n[noise] hey Laurie I'm I just wanted to talk about ah the\nCabinet and I guess my main concern is that um people are saying that he's not fit to be on the court because of his demeanor and uh I think that is so wrong because they are dealing with some personal I'm\nA attacks on him personally and of course he should be angry especially if they're untrue who wouldn't stick up for themselves when you have patently false statements and found that the whole country said\nAbout use less awful things and uh but I there is no way that ... but I think he was very right to stick up for himself if you don't do it will and\nHe had to be emphatic about it because he had ten people on the other side they couldn't say I'm not a couldn't say the sky was yellow are blue if it was a they couldn't tell the truth of their life depended on it and so he had to have\nA strong defense I mean gee that he's a lawyer he the judge I mean that that bode well and his defense but I'm telling you that if he if he gets on the court I just from looking at him I think he'd stare honest I think he dedicated to his profession or he wouldn't be where he is\nI think ... was the fact that he says this never happened\nBut you out a way I Want to know that if you wanted to do what they call arguing in the alternative which is some defense attorneys do where you say but if it were true that I did this thing in high school when it happened one time and never happened again how many of us would like to be judged professionally\nFor one thing\nThat happened one time Thirty years ago or ... something like this I think most people would say by that standard probably like the president suggested today he says he knows a bunch\nOf people on Capitol Hill from the Democratic party who weren't dirty themselves and not for things they did in high school but things they've done since they got into public office Debbie thank you for the call back in just a moment you're listening to Mars Mars and

on Michelle Owens who's an attorney and an expert on victim culture false allegations and attacks on due process not to mention title nine\nMichele welcome back to the program\n... thanks for having me\nSo what is victim culture doing to America\nAs well is pretty much reading it and then you know you only have to look at what's going on with that cabinet that the that\nAnd the the ... we've created a victim culture where it is a an honor to be a victim ... something to be tried for about ... is something that says to that and it's causing a lot of problems because when you're a victim you get a path\nAnd everything you you don't have responsibility for whatever you did you know and I had a bad grade on the class\nBecause still in the blank you know and that they you know it's it's having a big problem in a lot of ways um in creating a whole generation when then it said that the victim is no one idea as a as a good thing I\nI agree with you in fact we see people complimented on their courage for bringing a charged forward I Would imagine that you know to the extent that Christine Ford believes what she said under oath last week let's assume she actually believes it whether it's true or not is another matter that she was\nYou know she was congratulated on her courage for bringing in foreign she knew that you would face a certain amount of\nPublic uh I guess negative reaction but you would also get an awful lot\nOf positive reaction to not to mention some of the financial rewards that have already begun to begin to roll in in the form of about I think at last count about an eight hundred thousand dollars into a go fund me account so there are negatives but there are positives as well but she's congratulated because she had the courage to say something about it\nShe says this has trouble there for more than a third of the century and these other two accusers uh Debbie Ramirez who doesn't entirely remember what exactly what happened at Yale University and then we have Julie sweat Nick ... apparently didn't NBC interview today in which he began to back\nOff of some of the claims that she had made she had said that you know bread cabin on mark judge had spiked the punch\nTo ah intoxicated young women\nChildren really and and to take sexual advantage of them will she's not backed off of that saying merely she saw Kavanaugh by the punch bowl which I don't think is exactly an indictment but I mean literally she said well when asked by NBC News Monday whether she saw Kavanaugh slip substances into drinks which is what she said\nAs recently as last week sweating ... said she only witness to him by the punch well if you say why is that a big deal if the FBI has been out to have a chat with her if she told\nSaid she only witness to him by the punch well if you say why is that a big deal if the FBI has been out to have a chat with her if she told a lie to the FBI that's criminally punishable so I'm Wondering if maybe that's the reason that her story is changing just a week later\nWell I Wonder a lot about that and taking politics out of it completely because I'm not looking at it I I Do title nine representation I represent nails who are falsely accused of sexual assault every day that's what I Do so I see that when I look at it I don't see a political issue I see exactly\nWhat is happening to the students I represent every day somebody makes a statement and they're the hero and they're the victim and the one with the courage to come forward and being a rape victim these days is an honor it's that bad\nYou know where it's become the trend and it's really really concerning because first of all it destroys so many lives\nOf the ones they're accusing and what they're calling rape is no longer a the ... definition of rape that we used to have\nIn the criminal definition it's changed lately and they're taking away all the due process concerned so I just thought the idea of it is a fairly ridiculous and you know there's ... there's a pride\nThat goes with this victim mentality and I think the\nHeart of what is is\nSpring it all and um it's it's kind of silence pride that you know I'm a victim and therefore whatever I've done a screw up in my life is not my fault it is not my responsibility as someone else's it because they did that to me it is not on me\nYou know all the problems that I've had any fault you can't throw it back on me because it's not my fault out of victims\nYou know Michelle it sounds like you're trembling me for the last Twenty years because I remember Twenty years ago saying to a producer who happened to be a young lady I said to her I said I Need to find my victim status today and she said what do you mean I said it seems that everybody who is a victim has\nStatus that the ordinary human beings do not have and she said well where would you find it and I said well let's see when I was ten my mom was killed by a drunk driver I was in the car and I dragged her body out from under the car when my my father and I managed to get her out from under the car and I said so\nBy that standard I should have been a victim status that I can get away with just about anything except enough I I never thought of that as a way of saying well if I if I yell at one of my co workers I can say well you know my mom died when I was ten or if I drink too much alcohol I can say well my mom died when I was in other words\nEvery single thing I might do that somebody might object to I can say it's because my mom died when I was done I think my mom would reach down from heaven and slapped me upside the head if I did somebody like that because I tell you to do\nIt because I mean I'm also a therapist and and I say that just to kind of back up to that to say but you know you go through life\nAnd the goal is not to be a victim as being a victim it stunts you censor emotional grass and your growth as a person and what you're going to do in your life and and

S. M. C. A. that includes both Canada and Mexico has\nThis way of approaching trade deals by saying we will use tariffs if we have to to get our trade partners back to the table and negotiate a better deal for America has this worked out the way Donald Trump said it was going to work out\nNot quite I have to say because you know like is it there's no doubt that there's a big relief\nFrom investors and the market and uh and everyone on us they about the agreement that was a there was a now a late last night but that is because it took us all the weight of an edge that was created by the chaos a of Mrs Trump\nSo the one overwhelming benefit is that now we have a deal but the only reason why we were um he may not having a deal because Mr Trump said he was going to withdraw as\nFor a lord Harris yeah he really not getting any of this because the metal\nTerrorists are still on and neither do we tell you it tore their aid from Mexico and Canada are still on and honesty the concession the candidate did on dairy and\nThey're they're pretty minor I think we have to remember what we're talking about terrorists the the we have to remember what we had under NAFTA under NAFTA\nOwe us exports will go into Mexico UT free all non ag\nExports from neither of us going\nSports we're going to Mexico duty free all non ag\nExports from by the U.S we're going to Canada duty free and Ninety seven percent of the value of I\nExports was going to Canada duty free and so yes there were those stubborn like dairy dairy I'm I'm a terrorists and they are they were about but they will mostly bad for Canadian consumers\nFor some of our industries dairy for example you mentioned we got concessions from Canada would we have been able to get those any other way\nYes that's so you're you're a thing like basically yes a handful of dairy producer let's not forget we have a massive trade surplus when it comes to dairy with Canada so they were already you know a\nFarmer's American farmers were doing really great under NAFTA and um and and but so a few dairy farmers will be able to have more access\nTo the to the to the market ... of the market that they had a fairly good access to in the past but Canadian consumers are going to be ripping off really the benefits because the prices for them is going down quite you know quite important place\nSo choose their prices will go down but more American farmers will be able to sell their products indicated we heard famously about the two hundred and Seventy percent tariffs are being charge on American goods that meant that an American farmer who's costs are probably relatively the same as a Canadian farmer is to own cows he's got to\nHave for the court men and buildings and he's got to feed the cows that that whose products are to be sold at maybe one third the cause in Canada to be able to compete with locally produced milk cheese butter all the rest of that and\nAnd yet we had we had a massive trade surplus and dairy with Canada and then we ... we shouldn't be getting the impression that because our consumers in Canada we're ... we're going to have to pay a really much higher price um than uh\nBecause of the terrorists than they would otherwise they weren't buying a ton of dairy from from from the U.S\nThey were and it's and it's because you know the the way the Canadians suddenly the work is very different than ours it's like it's it's a lot of quotas on how much it can produce so much higher prices and things like this so\nUm it's it it's a different system and that's one where you fight of the the import tax imposed by Canada Canadian it was still in their interest to buy a lot of dairies from the U.S\nThat sense I think it's a very good thing it's a good thing for the ... more it's a great thing for Canadian consumers but it's also worth putting it in perspective that terrorist\nAlthough we're not an issue with NAFTA because most terrorists were a zero most export uh\nWith this one example where we're actually at zero if their problem was trade barriers they're mostly find found\nIn regulation and other things and and I don't know that we're getting a good deal on auto because um it's going to lead to higher prices of automobile now you know if you think that um the maybe some of the small benefits to union\nWorkers is is a good thing and then you'll think it's a good thing if you're a consumer of cars in the U.S it's not a good thing but again it could have been much worse and and and and it's a deal that\nPeople will learn to live with I don't think we should expect expect massive changes in employment where I don't think we should make it a expect massive jobs to come\nBack to the U.S because a lot of the lost his job and not affect trying started\nIn the Nineteen fifties due to automation but\nIt's better to have a deal and not do you have a deal and it could have been much worse\nThey let me ask you about some specific so I'll watch the president this morning talking about the deal and I've I've done some other research on one because we don't I mean some of the particulars we don't have publicly yet\nBut they said that more car and truck parts will be made in North America and that that is a boost from the old NAFTA\nAnd forty percent of the work on a car truck we'll have to be done by workers making at least sixteen dollars an hour and they said that and obviously this any trade deal has to be a winner not just for people buying and selling things were making things but also for people who are employed in the manufacture of things if\nThere is a minimum requirement that forty percent of the power to the work on a car has to be done by people who'd sixteen bucks an hour\nThat is for the most part Canadian or American workers and probably not Mexican origin workers' rights\nThat that is true but it doesn't mean that actually they will that the supply\nCan workers and probably not Mexican origin workers right\nThat that is true but it doesn't mean that actually they will that the supply that first let's let's uh first say that um it's not as if we're going from a system where they will no requirement to the system that now has all these requirements on\nNeighbor or certainly it is but I'm actually quite surprised that you actually find that a good to impose increasing the cost of labor\nBecause if the Democrats were asking for an increase of the minimum wage is sixteen percent you will understand that this is a great distortion to the American labor market and it's not a good thing but now let's let's\nJust say that that are under the deal as\nWe can especially considering the protection for uh the Canadian and the Mexican\nFrom potential auto tariffs then the future of it is very possible that this these requirement of a of a higher wages and also of a more sourcing in Canada Mexico and\nUm and and the U.S of auto parts will just means that automakers are going to not change their supply chain but instead we'll decide to face a two point five percent care\nThat the U.S has in place is going to depend they depend on their on their on their own you know business model right and they're not going to be a one size fit all but\nYeah I had quite a lot of anxiety these days ... upcoming you know we all do I mean and all three of us were their experience the exact same thing and we each have a different take on it we each remember things differently each or haven't been affected differently through this year\nBut um we we have continued to move on we we go to country music outdoor festival all year long

could have shared it with the FBI if you could have discreetly conducted\nThis great in July and August without trying misfortune confidence as and they have betrayed her\nThey pointed her lawyers who

investigation and in the midst their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff\nIs going to face and investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly it happens hundreds

issues that are this sense of ... and I'm going to get a chance to talk about\nSo there you go ... ...\nI Want to move away from that because that doesn't look good for the narrative are yeah well no because those those are huge points that he may mean those are those are huge points first about the lawyers we ate at that question we'd have that we'd ask that question early on was she made it seem like\nFord made it seem like I never knew that the committee wish to talk to me what the committee talked to the lawyers and that's what we had asked that question we said that hasn't been that hasn't been resolved and Tom Cotton coming out over the weekend insane her lawyers didn't tell her [noise] and\nThey need to that and and as you said for lawyers will face a Washington DC bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to California to interviewer well why wouldn't say\nRight [noise] [noise]\nI mean who were working for your pro bono are you [noise] you're not working in the best interests of your client if you're not giving them the options that\nIs the charge the pot and is making there which is huge because

client I'm not paying them\nOh [noise] so are they actually working for you and that's\nWhere you and I talked about this Friday and cotton is making the allegation that\nThey'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her when you ask the question why didn't they inform her if she didn't know\nWhy did it and will those questions be asked by the F ... uh well\nI mean you would you you're looking to through the FBI looking to vet the process all over again right\nBecause it is a serious allegation it's\nJust as much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the truth is not necessarily to find out which one is lying because one of them is why\nIt's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused\nThe other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats and the media we're always trying to make the point\nThe allegation as it is the accused\nAnd the other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats and the media we're always trying to make the point will Feinstein did her best to one wouldn't know she didn't and\nAs we subtle along if you listen to the show we said look there is a process and I'm Glad that Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and ... and they said they do this hundreds of times you and and\n... he doesn't know who will not be sensitive because no justice sensitive on other issues but things that are highly\nSecretive that we don't want people to know about because we are doing you know in in different investigations and so this has actually done where she should have\nWhen she got the letter she the protocol is you go to Grassley you're the ranking minority member\nYou go to Grassley you've talked about it and you say okay one group well probably what we have a ... you would have said was look we can lead to contact her back and tell her we can do an FBI investigation if she wishes to this to go forward we can do an FBI investigation and\nWe can keep her name out of it for a certain period of time but we can definitely do the FBI investigation we can actually\nInterview people on this and keep your name out of it and then we get to a certain point we might not be able to but as to the point of the investigation absolutely we can did find signed tell her that\nTo bring it at the last possible second yup\nKnowing that they're only play here was political in nature not actual procedural other than delaying the process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation\nBut the Democrats didn't really want an FBI investigation had they wanted the investigation Feinstein would have made that happen right away which tells me one thing a couple of things they didn't buy into her story number one because if they if they felt\nIt was fully credible and could be proven and backed up by an FBI investigation and Feinstein would've acted July thirtieth\nAnd you know something I I I agree with the Democrats they they do you shouldn't do an expanded they should do and expanded uh uh you know a background check and they should\nTalked to forward and say ... or ... your lawyers are with you by the way why didn't you tell her that they were willing to come and see her yeah so does anybody paying you besides her let's let's let's expand this\nI Wonder if the Democrats really wish to be expanded\nI'm doubting\nOkay we're done it's a wake up they were going to vote no anyway so it was\n[laughter] well because what they need is a new unobtainable\nCoal\nSo in this case uh like you said Ramirez she needs to be her she needs to\nTest I I Believe that will be the next day she needs to tell her story they are going to realize this one's going nowhere so you need to go to the next allegation that's not cooperated and hear from her and you just go down the line and you see how far you can extend this now the ball was in procedurally the balls and McConnell score yes\nBut the vote is not you know\nWhere the votes fall is not can you stand to lose a jet flick yes if you have\nA man I Can't who still on the fence Donnelly is a no no if you had mentioned you can lose you've got mansion you can lose if you've got high camp and if you've got Collins and if you got a faster\nThan what you want to fester he said no so if if that goes forward how many I guess the question is how many can you afford so you can you can lose if you've got if mansions on you can lose like in one more\n\nBecause you've got fifty one and so imagine would make fifty two you could lose than to still have fifty and have the vice president break develop right\nThat if they think they've got that then McConnell's not going to hold it up at all if they've got a lot they have the oath they would have done this over the weekend I I I have the feeling that they will I have a feeling that if the FBI investigation comes in and you know even if it\nTo ... and said look nobody can cooperate her story either a ... on this in fact we sort of get the same thing with the the witness was there a I think at that point they will have the

cancer which is very unusual as you know for a man over six years ago this happened uh to Bob uh after\nNoticing a large lump under his arm he visited his doctor and after a number of\nTests including a mammogram an ultrasound was diagnosed so uh I I Am so glad and I and I mentioned this I\nDon't do this ahead of time or for someone\nWho has a problem medically but the reason I did is because Bob just wanted other men to realize that this does happen to you he's from Waterbury, Connecticut\nAnd uh he said he heard the words you have\nBreast cancer over six years ago after noticing a large lump under his arm he visited his doctor and after a number of tests including a mammogram and ultrasound\nIt was diagnosed so he's going to be with me at ten minutes after eight o'clock this morning but here's you know there are so many\nPeople today and Bob is one of them Bob is one of them that wants to reach out if they can help somebody now here is someone\nWho went through this and causes and wants to tell you about it especially talk to the to the men because it's true when you when you when you talk about breast cancer you don't think right away a man\nIt's always the women so again the Bob we look forward to a chatting with you\nAt ten minutes after eight o'clock this morning and I thank you thank you very very much twenty eight minutes after\nThe hour of seven o'clock I was talking earlier\nAbout a a President Trump\nAnd what he has accomplished a unbelievable and everybody's talking about it United States Canada Mexico agreement or a big changes for cars as well and uh he didn't know whether he could\nPull it off but he did\nHe did he said yes this is something that uh he wanted to do and he wanted to uh to get done and and just a few minutes a you are going to meet a a von Davis She been with me before\nAnd she is someone that uh is very very\nWell known she's been all over the all over the world and uh we're going to see what she thinks about this and uh she's going to take a a a a look at the President Trump and just uh how this is going to settle\nPeople would say hey this is what is all about we're going to be busier and ... and and everything and I I'm kind of surprised that that he was able to get it through buddy most of I don't know what he did but\nHe uses the terror of as his Trump Card I mean he's you if you look at\nPresident Trump does not support multilateral agreements and you need if you watch the pattern of foreign policy pulled out the Iran deal he pulled out the peace accord it given less money to the UN and\nBelieves in coming to the table and creating bilateral agreements now in this regard as the tri lateral agreement in North America but he said let's just wrap it up and start\nJust started again and so that's what he's done and he's looked at every key relationship across the globe and now you have others coming to the table I mean the big nut to crack\nObviously will be trying to because there's a clear trade war but you must India he he actually a threatened tariffs big on India and president Modi wants to talk with him now he has\nAn agreement coming with South Korea ah now they use as is talking to him so I think that the approach cheap taking is a hard line approach but\nIt is it just sort of a hand the whole uh on\nApproach to how foreign policy has been done before I'm looking at it straight from an analysis perspective and not looking at the other side lined comments of what he says there doesn't say is or the name calling\nPeople are coming to the table if you look at all what's happened in NATO heat that NATO's not paying that people are members of NATO and not paying their fair share\nDo he constantly called out the countries and then you have countries coming to the table sell it and his price says he says America has been a\nAll paying too much for too long and been taken advantage of so that hasn't been his\nHis his approach and so in this regard for this trade agreement in North America this is a positive I mean over time\nWe'll see you expect to be signed at the end of November and it would go into effect and in twenty twenty in of course Congress would have to pass which I Can't imagine Congress not passing cautions might be the smaller farmers the\nSmaller auto companies how they might benefit there is a key piece of workers would they would get sixteen dollars an hour\nMexico was forced to recognize um\nThe labor laws in the rights of fall of of of of of of of their of their workers because of human rights issues so there's there's other component to it so for anyone to say this is not a win which is\nWhen it's not realistic it is a big win for the United states and the president does does your credit for this\nUm what I Would I Do is I go thirty thousand feet in the air and look at the whole his whole off his whole approach to foreign policy and that's why I call there might be where people may not accepted a Trump Doctrine started to emerge when you look at what's happened with ISIS in Syria\nThe Trump Administration decided to equip the Kurdish militia to drive out ISIS there has not and you've heard me sit on your show before bread there has not been any major terrorist attack in two thousand Eighteen and so\nWhile the Obama Doctrine avoiding large scale off more conventional wars in the middle east I think the did he actually\nThe previous administration didn't force the red line regarding Bosh or al Assad and Trump did and then of course when you look at North Korea which remains to be seen the maximum pressure strategy which was officially called by this administration on North Korea\nHas brought North Korea to the table for economic reasons so you have to look at everything and then the legal immigration has been reduced so\nWhen you look straight at in in the eye of what's happening this\nIs what's happening on on the international scale and that's what I say to the listeners that it's important for you to look at full contact not which is happening at home\nBut abroad because it does affect what happens at home and so in fact just bought bread it was important to point that out and you know how I Am bread I don't get in the sidebar comment necessarily about what he called her what name he called or what he did but in this regard\nYou have to call it like it it\nWell I thank you for the report that I knew a Yvonne the you're on top of this stuff all all the time and there were there were people very very well surprised at the fact\nThat these other especially Mexico evidently a that's a good deal and the we've never had\nSomething really good was Mexico before so it's going to be interesting to see how long this comes out and also uh the cars and I thank you very very much for we grow and sharing your time with us in the uh we'll talk again thank you\nOkay thank you you better care\nVon Davis who uh this is what she does for ... for a living but again as she does it\nIt's hard on the on these folks if she doesn't like what what they've done [noise]\nBut uh I I was surprised that the people that are never talked about and we're talking about and this time now because of a\n... because of Mexico actually there were those who said that there's no way that Donald Trump is going to be able to get along with the with the Mexico but it's all it's all part of the heart of the pie okay it's coming up to a quarter of the hour\nThe order of eight in the morning let's check traffic again see how the bumper to bumper crowd is doing and here's that report\n[noise]

that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh\nHopefully strongly there there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah outsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats little oppose it in in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that\nOr the thinking doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think ah the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticism you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us well if the Democrats should\nUh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and farmers and ranchers\nIt's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being purely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go jaded then I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood from CNBC said specifically regarding autos\nLet's listen there are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nIt means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they won't be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nCall I guess Mike I if I had to make one word it would be nonsense you wonder about people who make statements like that there there are so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all\nThe ... the major auto companies General Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota\nHave all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing yeah\nThat's a good thing they've all set is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take him to sort of sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just reading something about it and they'll realize\nHow they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be really very very important for him for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea of the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do want is we increase the content\nOf cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff\nWe're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent how was that a bad thing under under the ... the person\nWho's going to lose out on this is China and places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy that people don't know what they're talking about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America\nNow it could be Canada also but in America for the most part that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by American labor\nYou know I think what President Trump prominence on his on the campaign trail he promised he delivered five Lighthizer us TR what's next I mean are you guys going to get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland or some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they and the Swiss are anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\n[noise] yeah and that we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise]\nWe have a lot of things that we're doing a small deal dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go through 'em but there's a bunch of other countries and then of course the big you know the big elephant in the room just China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you just one last time on the wall Street Journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things to sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S in the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like one of these\nOne of these things what you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite oh it was the other ones that you should look at it I I ask any of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the open\nAnd I'm looking I'm actually looking at it now and January

I I don't even have words for that it's outrageous but I don't think this goes over well\nIn middle America I don't think it goes over well in most places outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts or\nMaybe it on to college campuses speaking of the college campuses\nThis uh Georgetown professor we're going to be delving into more of this a Republican senators should die miserably be said to pigs for supporting Kavanaugh and she has had a history of nasty comments about Trump's supporters\nUh and calling them all sorts of names and Raymond made a good point that can you imagine if a professor\nWho was even even modestly a Republican said anything\nResembling the ... the vitriolic nature of what this professor Christine fair at Georgetown said\nWould that would that\nSlightly Republican professor survive that professor would be run off campus not that there are many Republican professors anyway would be run off campus that\nThat's that's that's ... that's ... you're expressing your expressing male aggression or if it's a well we already had one\n... um male professor have to apologize for making a simple comment simple comment about credibility and Christine Ford get into more of this\nBut the double standard is just unbelievable the views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities or their own\nAnd not the views of the university does that mean if somebody express racist views on Twitter that that person would not would not be fired from Georgetown\nOur policy does not prohibits speech based on a person presenting ideas or the context of those ideas even when those ideas\nMaybe difficult controversial or objectionable well faculty members may exercise freedom of speech we expect that their classrooms and interaction with students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell\nWhen you go to go on that rate your professor website um some interesting reviews of this particular professors teaching style come up a namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that\nUnbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this in a conservative wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in her class you know simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worse or lectures or never supported just presented his unvarnished dogma this is not what Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor\nRating Mm [noise] so this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor in his private capacity tweeting support for Kavanaugh\nOr anything it using the same type of language toward Christine forward supporters he would be fired they would figure out a way to run him off campus even if he were tenured that figure out a way to do even if they had to pay him that get them off campus\nDo you agree with me a five five forty Laura or we'll talk more about this a and a woman who knew Christine Ford in at North Carolina state will get to that and a lot more coming\nUp and [noise]\nLet's think about how students shouldn't presented by liberty mutual insurance liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need the wire more things in life customize\nBecause if we start going down this road even in the public sphere even in the public arena\nUm it's going to enter into our court system\nAnd we have an air security and our democracy if we allow this to happen\nAnd people are saying is that he's he doesn't have a right to the Supreme Court well ... accusations and accuser does not have the right to be believed\nThey just simply don't this message about women's within ... worth that we are to believe them simply because they're winning simply because there are many of them are victims that there have been abuses in the past\nBut this isn't that the standard by which we judge people we judge people on his back rationality and the judge people based on what can be presented in the evidence ... feelings and this attack on Kavanaugh grilling have about\nKnocking out do you remember getting drunk and how you behave in college and just always the presumption of of guilt going forward and in every way that they have questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nUh now describe if you don't mind your thoughts on on Christine forward given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate right\nI I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her type friendships here but I was in her\nCircles and I know the environment that she was on that we were all in especially a freshman and sophomore year we were\nPartying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and what point in bringing it up is not\nTo blame her for her you know if she were if she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way you deserve to get raped but my point is if you only have he said she said if you don't have any corroborating evidence\nThen you need to look at the character of both people you need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing it in college and you know we should be you know if you're going to grill Brett Kavanaugh about this she also needs to be looked at as well because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of\nCooperating evidence and you can't forget that weight and she also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that she did well in high school\nYou know really what was going on during that period sheltered change the timeframe from being in the mid eighties or early eighties she kept switching back and forth but did it happen in college or is it happened in high school\nYou know literally flush out exactly what her story is she right on the stand the lawyer would grill her about this they would grow her about the details of hurt continent but somehow we have to hold her with kids love\nRight then again the feminists were supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own and they're not a bunch of damsel in distress and yet oh you're exactly right on the ... last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to\nThe a credibility gap ah for moves forward in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a six month prosecutor who's not political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear\nOr not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of cooperating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts then you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nFrom Memphis actually right it's about how she made people feel because\nI didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest and she didn't she didn't vote like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing but so Trump traumatized her for four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and redecorating and you know we had\nA he has no emotion that corresponded\nWith what she was staying compete TST and trauma and horrors of it all what they would have been more anger there were more fear and passion and more directed a she would detach she her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very detached in her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can associate dissociate when they're raped and stuff that she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has PATS the which means that you're heightened in your awareness of what happened and so she just did not she was not ... to me on feelings or fat\nOr ... at the end of the day we need to look at the facts and the facts didn't measure up she lives in the ... and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a contract to the right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that and then we've got a really wouldn't need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or Catholic it's about our liberty principles and about our democracy\nAbout our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principal we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type\nDating menacing behavior of you know\nAttacking people in public restaurants or elevators or\nYou know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers and all are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first once thought\nBecause they are driven by irrationality they've banned in fact he's a band and objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level all they have all their subject is dealing and power\nAnd if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of the objective truth in order to have dialogue than the most powerful the biggest bully in the room it's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of bully\nTheir bowling every one or two but to advance their power and it and part of that and ... there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are\nTrying to use you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on and different kinds of fears now what's going on in in the titan\nRelationship scare and women and ripping our country apart and you know if we if this means that we have to let ... rapist go free because we can't prove that it's better\nTo stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty oh I'm actually the fact that just real life that that's what's that's being in a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake\nWho lived up to his last name I mean they they they're perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from it\nIt's like a kid like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of uh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorists at the type of political\nAnd emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be\nExposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a\nIn a in a way meaningless journalists don't like to be demonize the fake news and so forth would imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator where where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them and I think that would be the first ones to say wait a second year in terminating the press but what about intimidating of\nA of a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station is as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them and it does that count at all fairly not you\nKnow and and but we like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nA and that is one of my reasons for challenging a Christine Ford about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing her anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she was then and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecute him than we need to ask\nFor the same kind of questions and you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in the political sphere then why should we believe me we're not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to ... just because you're allowed and bowling and yelling at us and and the restaurants you know we're we're not you know we're not the ones who have to take it for you\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election was all about don't you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of a little bad policies bad economic policies bed foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it\nAnd he said look I'm Out of

him\nI'm I'm I'm actually thinking clients while I'm On I'm a huge money to further my education will take the call oh I'd say about a month who by year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking\nAnd so um yeah we need a double your income pretty quick here as fast as you go and when I'm double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever\nAnd just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\nRoommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\nUm they have about a hundred pounds if I drop out in about a day I'm which not wearing um I kind of thing that you\nUm that they're taking care of that ad is like ... more credit where do you mean they're taking care of that moment when they are fake whom I\nPay a whole not allowing off to Africa\nOr that now we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any that you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free and then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses so like five thousand dollars a set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can\nAnd you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead when you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up\nAs you start using your cosmetology degree and um because you know your Thirteen thousand when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling of that's still not a lot of money\nBut that'll at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build so hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is whether it's a prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I got five boys I have kids and we just moved into our dream on all three years ago or ten twelve acres along through because it could turn around but the last few months we just heard is your plan where in baby steps you know\nAnd we're just thinking um when we got thirty five thousand undead besides the house and we're just not sure if you want and we need to sell the house\nHas to be dead free or which is ... through the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it out than\nTen to Fifteen Years they maintain our house and everything yeah like\n... where you know we have twenty eight years left my mortgage\nMhm so what's your house you know it's about Seventy K take home pay take 'em but All right yeah and um then what is your house payment is around twelve hundred a month okay\nHouse payments not out of line here that's fun you know and but you got a lot of kids you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah\nBecause you've got thirty thirty five hours to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take you year and a half two years but something like that you need you no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up right what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA part of the loan from the parents and part of it is my credits twenty five line of credit and ten grand and alone from our parents\nOkay Mm So just a line of credit what'd you bond with the line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago or dismiss plenty of wearing\n... and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just wanna be free yeah we love the place would\nNot I don't think they I don't think you need to sell the house houses now you know when you're twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home pay is not at all on\nYour your okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget\nAnd get that going as quick as you can ever dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone and you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clearly there's thirty five because if you include the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids\nAnd you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable you can do that as a lay down and you can do that\nA thirty five thousand out of Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and the term landing on Eighteen months\nRichard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nHi Dave I'm great got how can I help [noise]\nI haven't wandering about emerging think until we have a fully funded emerging keep that\nOut of the three to six months good and I have about Fifteen thousand in there [laughter] I'm at my job offer an H up they account and they match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great I'm so should I fully fund April the account and shit I count that towards any lower\nHundred dollars a year great um hold should I go on April ... towards anymore emerge Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course you can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills it will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house was a single income\nYou know single em okay and what's your household income of around ... to er nurse\nYou're a nurse okay very very stable career meaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one and twenty minutes nursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back at all you can change direction\nAll kinds of stuff you just really ever landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that\nGiven that you've got that type of a career that it's not so specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something to do six minutes\nUm then given that that's the situation I Would back and you ... if a person that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to three months ago and so that's kind a like partially leaning on the age of say\nAs part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose your job you could um\nHave the death of a relative and yet the pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car\nAnd all kinds of things that can happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ages I Dream about medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact he got a big fat I just say with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being almost three months side of the three to six months [noise]\nRain for your emergency [noise]\n... at so and and it really hasn't had any yet just because it it's still so fast we just did this last night while for congratulations\nAnd

you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely incredible what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nSay there's a few things are obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles and trials in life that if you guys on working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not\nNot live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of

I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nLike there was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes\nAnd then ... they're not are not like it's not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off\nWe could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by I just be an okay by sound like you're getting ... a great deal there were you just went wow has the best deal ever right\nThis is I'm not sure if I'm like I even get kicked\nOut 'cause someone gated or should I leave it on ... or I should I go back ran over\nWell where no one on the long term whether you want to own um\nWell my wife she we kind of didn't want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got everything in the area if I'm like I said my wife great grandma's house that she can hear her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country what part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to\nMy wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now ... and you got\nOne child you said and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income\nUh make uh every player an amateur kind of get in school but I had to kind of work with the er Santa that was that much I Know the Muslim themselves [noise] um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd your wife doesn't work [noise] okay that's pretty ... and that's where he's right on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nAnd we found out about you not long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me so I live near the so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff going out to eat and we're already kind of\nYou know trying to start it off a little better and\nYou are good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is\nThe uh the relatives that are involved that would be the air's\nA this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren that would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer\nAnd go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house to be sold hand would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar to be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that\nThat's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that\nDone okay I don't think you need that expense right now though\nWith all the ... the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages are paid I doubt you're going to get thrown out\nBecause that's what I was thinking should I as I also kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction as what I Do know I kind of this house has kinda is not beat up they've kind of beat up and fight the last\nFew years she yeah here and like other relatives staying there kind of beating it up so I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more and maybe you know what I'm saying maybe we can flip it and get another house or you know I Lived there\nUnless you become the owner of it\nIn and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now the Mayans game or should I\nTell you what I Would do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day\nWhen you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it you're probably not gonna ever bother to own it\nAnd if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay so uh what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment is rent I Would not spend any money on this\nAnd I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today it's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts\nTo become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah\nWell I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many\nOn 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that the thing you're paying the oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because that's one of the man that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nBut I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody called me and me out because it's not in my ...\nIt's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nIt might have gone on his way like get nobody command me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they're going to bring you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and yeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all\nIt's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it if it was valuable now there'll be some sharks and them water circling right\nBut it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it because some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they need a little of some of them you know and then they had because\nThat's money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone when you leave 'cause there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name\nAnd you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars\nAnd you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that\nAnd um and you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent to a place you kinda like living and uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there in front of you for now it's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter\nAnd some day you're just going to move on ... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner than getting ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the ... court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it and that's what you're facing\nSo it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is elope probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought his worth two hundred thousand box as a relatives thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old\nNo charge would already been ... they\nWould have been trying to figure out some way to get that things sold and get the courts Lou it when you die without a wheel and you have to go in and the judge has to authorize the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess and do you can't get cleaned titles of this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it\nAny other way than doing it properly and getting clean title because you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean titled so that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent it's a rental house\nHow much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move often you don't own nothing not any as what you would do [noise] all that helps man's thanks for calling in this is the Dave Ramsey

people on there and I was trying to help them with their money and it was just like I'm the only seen one in the whole dead gums that\nIt was crazy but there was one of the lady that um that they would bring on this lady that was a psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever and so she was there to like help crazy people with a crazy and I was there to help people with their money thing and that was a it was those shows those kind of show\nAnd um she and I ended up talking in the green room after that and she was the one she gave me some study and I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation between extreme levels of financial control and domestic violence\nSo if you have a friend who is not allowed to go to the grocery store by herself without her husband\nOr her boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hidden or\n\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was I mean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control and it's all about bullying at a different level [noise]\nAnd um and so there's just a sickness it's involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and you can see it and and after doing that reading that

any more to this because I'm coming back to this lady from Oakland in a minute on the Savage Nation joined us Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred seven eight five or four hundred and seven to eight to\n\nThis story is called the ugly truth about Tom share everything that you've done your family if I were buying a timeshare you name my help hello I'm ... now CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancer alerts\nWe can leave them behind you have the power when I see a decent man and his family destroyed all this\nI realize that anybody can be destroyed in this country by the Feinstein gang this gang of commerce ours are doing to Capitol what was done in the Soviet Union what was done in Hitler's Germany and denouncing someone you destroyed that person there was no trial there was no trial necessary\nAll you did was denounced the person and they were ruined\nThese are the tactics of the Nazis in Germany and the Soviets in Russia I used to think we're a nation of laws and that with defamation of libel laws you couldn't get away with this but then I woke up and found out that the senators are above the law movies have been done about them\nBooks have been written about this kind of corruption remember I wrote a novel called abuse of power set in San Francisco it was a New York times best seller you wouldn't know what it's called abusive power jak Hatfield was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of information and smear campaign and what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for forty years about McCarthyism\nAnd McCarthy are now actually worse than senator McCarthy ever was at its height because as I pointed out and stop mass hysteria McCarthy was actually right when he accused all of those members of Hollywood and the media\nAnd of academia of working with the Soviet Union he was denounced as a crackpot even though he had been a war hero they made a mockery of the show you how smart the left is they took senator McCarthy who had been a tail gunner in World War two one of the most dangerous of all positions\nThink of it a glass bubble in the back of a bomber with machine guns facing enemy fighters\nHe survived all that he came out a war hero became a U.S senator\nThe vermin on the left called them tail gunner Joe as if that was something to mock rather than salute but that was just the beginning they said he was a drunk they said he made it all up well they destroyed the man he died a hopelessly broken man\nWhat they did to McCarthy is what they're doing to Kavanaugh and then you want to get in a way of the left wing failings that has destroyed America over the last fifty years now we had an election\nAnd we put Donald Trump in power we stopped there juggernaut\nAnd they're fighting to turn it around with every one of his major appointments make no mistake about it this is really a mandate on you I've said this you'll be four\nBy smearing cabin or their smearing you you could be a black transsexual a woman in Berkeley and you're being smeared if you voted for Trump do you understand that\nYou understand how this works do you understand their smearing you by smearing him\nAnd it's just the beginning and so the only thing we can do is fight back\nAnd again I say with the keyboard\nAnd a little native intelligence you could probably uncover things about the senators that might just have them running back under the rocks that they crawled out of the stores that they live in\nBecause the Internet as a very powerful tool there's a lot of lives on it but somewhere in the midst of the lies they may be some nuggets of gold\nAnd I invite you the listeners to become the detectives to turn on the committee members who have done this to a decent man I have never in my life seen anything like this never\nBut again getting back to what McCarthy and the McCarthyism that the left you still want us about just for a moment\nUh years later there was a publication and titled of an owner papers V E N O and I wrote about it and one of my previous books and the owner papers were written by former KGB agents\nAnd they disclose that in fact all of the people named in the committees and the hearings in the fifties by McCarthy Warren facts Soviet\nOperatives or Soviet fellow travelers every last one of them was guilty and so here we are now watching the equivalent of the quote McCarthyism we were warned about\nTaking place right in front of our eyes\nAnd hardly one journalist in the United states of America makes the connection\n[noise] it's a very very sad day but the truth show went out and I do ask you on Tuesday to vote with your credit card and please get a copy of stop mass hysteria but not just get the book to enrich me because I'm not going to buy a new car I'm asking you to carry it home\nAnd put it on your coffee table because I guarantee you there's someone in your family who doesn't believe a word that you say someone who was ignorant as a door post who knows nothing about history [noise] who knows nothing about how the witch trials of Salem or identical to the witch trials of Kavanaugh but they are\nSame methods of mass hypnosis and mass hysteria that's just one example there are numerous numerous others and I invite you to take home this cone your co pay of information it's not just a polemic it's a history book\nEight five five four hundred seven to eight to let's see some of the cause if I can they're run them a I'm a little afraid of this one brick WABC what's your statement

had an interesting life he's a cancer survivor he has had\nBallots with alcoholism apparently and I must I Wish nothing but the the best mark judge hopefully security is a medical issues and has worked on his personal demons but\nYou know he he does he want to be part of it he wants to just to get out of his he's issued statements that he couldn't recall these parties couldn't recall these incidents or or any of the suggestions of like Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of\nAnd of course some were saying oh but in this book wasted tales of Gen x drunk and then he had a character by the name of barge oh Kevin on that must be\nA Brett Kavanaugh right now even if it's based on a hammer friends reviews friends' names are altered names or just to you know draw some familiarity but still you can change the story if you're writing a piece that\nContain some fictional account so I I Want to read the book so I went on to Amazon dot com last night to look for the book and oh here it is looking as only has two stars of the reviews by summer are not great on the book\nIs it uh\nIt is available there are um uh some buying options here and as I scroll down to see the price and the book

nine hundred Ninety nine dollars right so now I'm just checking it now\nAnd the price has been lowered the price is now one thousand nine hundred and forty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents so I better jump on this bargain while I can be caused a that's a fifty dollar savings folks and\nThat's that's pretty John enormous fears I I've been a jump on this before somebody else a snake this copy ask them underneath me a ... click here for all buying options let me see if there were more ...\nAnd I don't think this is an Amazon deal I'm sure this is a private seller a son of really so if I buy

free shipping\nAnyway I passed on the book I I did not push the add that to my cart buttons yeah uh I I I didn't do it\nSo I'm I'm gonna have to hold off on reading the mark judge book for now I bones or a loaded here will grab your calls coming up on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get out\nAnd let's get into some more serious issues the NBC interview with Kate Snow this was an embarrassment and the bombing nation I'm gonna tell you why next\nAlso the president spoke about the dangerous time for boys young man in America all back next [noise]\nNow but no\nRight now five court judge ... wholesome credit motor oil are only Eighteen it protects her as your from sludge of extreme temperatures but that you know it also protects our troops are put each purchase of metaphor synthetic for Eighteen Ninety nine a portion goes to be a ... year old ...\n... vets that from Noel or no Joe six percent sales prejudice about a foot because they look exactly the recycling offer instead thirty one eighty\n... to discuss the issues that I find the time I get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story you know she was backing away she's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made\nWhen ... first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing\nBrett Kavanaugh and she's she's backed off of some of these claims so NBC News of the cage snow they said they couldn't be sure\nThat they reported that that this went and they couldn't be sure that Kavanaugh was one of the boys was sold to the during a party in the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back off\nThat that that's that's a change in the story\nSo remember this this sworn affidavit that came out last week from this this Julie sweat make\nA that as an oddity release that she was the victim of a gang rape at a party and she saw Kavanaugh misbehaving and\nActing aggressively toward women now though she says I cannot specifically say that he Kavanaugh was one of the ones who assaulted me\nBut before this happened to me at the party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw a mark judge and they were hanging out where I started to feel this oriented and where the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing\n\nSo you know again this is an incredibly vague in the sworn statements she claimed the cabinet consistently engaged in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early eighties so when NBC aired this on MSNBC on cable\nCage snow said quote NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify or claims there are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statements last week\nThat was on MSNBC but they didn't have the same disclaimer when they ran excerpts on the NBC nightly news where many more millions of people see that so that's my that's my big problem that's a big beef and I have with at NBC News here\nAnd you know she's she's tracking\nCheers backtracking you know on some of these details you know in a in a statement last week the cabin on march judge they weren't the party she was ... she was gang raped and I remember she didn't accused Canada all the sole thing or her specifically but she claimed that she witnessed Kavanaugh\nParticipate in a gang rapes I mean what was that was from the ... the initial claim\nHe was a very aggressive very sloppy or he was very I mean I saw him go up and I are going to girls and Paul on them touching them in private parts trying to shift closing\nI saw him Push Girls against the wall he would pretend to stumble on stumble into them push them into a wall he would grow them but then again we have we have changes we have differences in once she originally said or in the sworn statement versus what she told\nNBC News you know one of the issues was that she saw\nA you know the cabinet was responsible for spiking the punch it some of these parties and now I Know ah you know just he saw she saw him a round the container holding the punch\nSophie's she's changing these stories you know also she's backtracking\nApparently here it appears that way on that in capital was also involved in these gang rapes are now she saying only that I ... is he would see him congregated near the rooms with boys outside rooms where she thought\nThat boys were gathering in order to rape girls I mean this is I I really [noise]\nIn in a court of law this crap is going to hold up so we've got New Orleans areas where her story is shifting and changing\nYou know watching the excerpt on NBC nightly news last night I saw her blinking and looking down and I mean just some of the classic tells when someone's not telling the truth in my opinion\nSo again NBC News why are you giving sweating at the time of day\nA salacious a tabloid dish and you should have been above the sweat Nick free\nOr let's grab a couple of calls here on snow that was that Trump all they want to play from earlier today a in a hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nLet's have a mass of people on New York Long Island where I Will be later this evening because of my daughter's soccer commitments CJ on Schnell is CJ welcome\nYou're on your show short brief the seventh or it has to go from there you know I I'm I guarantee you that's good\nAnd as Julie ... read Dick uh sweating to use\nThe gang bang it a crime and don't you go gr and now she knows she only gang back on\nA a\nThat's a lovely ... thank you thank you so much CJ [laughter] did you write that yourself a boy I thanks for the call I appreciate it as oh as far as the FBI report a\nSuit can Hugh Grant me the latest just prior to coming on there were reports that the the new supplemental FBI report that it would not be made public\nA but the question is one of the things that the caller just said before he started Kooning or is\nThat uh he suggested the report is going to leak so this is the report is apparently going to be in the hands of the White House or the Senate or will the Senate committee obviously will the Senate Judiciary committee they will see the report as well\nSo will the report to leach as the caller suggested you know I I don't know but there are rumblings and reports that this the supplemental report will not be made public back to the phones let's grab by how about Tony in Washington DC let's go to the swamp hello Tony you're on Schmidt\nHello hey I Believe that the sweating to interview with good due to the fact that it shows the uh the the defamation of Kavanaugh's character ah that um they will just continue to be coached and do anything that can hurt this guy even without the proof\nSo your thought is that NBC did a service by showing sweat neck because most people would look at her and deem her to be no\n... that was MSNBC but now I'm be the one that they the the Kool Aid\nWell well not all that was the same interview them so MSNBC you have the long interview I watched that\nRight so the MSNBC of the long interview and then the NBC nightly news broadcast last night they took an excerpt of the longer MSNBC interview and they play that so your suggestion is is that NBC while I don't think NBC should have given her the time of day of giving her any degree of a platform you saying that NBC\nShowing her\nIt shows that she's not a credible individuals how would you suggest actually\nAnd that and be NBC or just feed the Kool Aid for uh the the the whole situation\nWell certainly on the MSNBC side more so but I I have plenty of issues on the broadcast side from time to time as well Tony thanks for the call let's go out west will have a as a gamblers let's go to ... games games as in Prescott, Arizona hello gains

bars that okay for God's sakes to throw ice overall far I mean that's just horrible\nI it is I you know in fact that might be considered a a misdemeanor maybe a ... type of battery I I'm thinking throwing ice that ought to be revisited from a legal standpoint that ought to be alone is what do you stand\nOut as you said earlier I had a heart frozen water as opposed to the liquid water to\nAdd several years to a certain age so absolutely yeah I I Can't ... you're you're sweating I'm Sorry the color of your ... I'm Sorry sweating to the oldies ladies and gentlemen\nYeah well she returns to this place nine times I understand so it must have been a nice experience for well\nYou know well I was I I don't want to go down that road I don't want to trivialize any type of assault abusive rape allegations or incidents where we can confirm we know when things happen to us and there are bad things that happened\nBut there are a lot of questions about her story that you know her claim was that she was gang raped but then you know according to our timeline that she went back after that\nAre also the fact that she was older they these individuals why was she going to high school parties if she was already in college a lot of questions regarding this woman in her credibility and then her background or look at her a litigious uh\nTime is running out to capture the fine have you noticed all this oh what's it been going up in the area if you had at least four hours a night on your ... per day and a really good condition you may qualify to read the solar at no cost quite limited time only Connecticut homeowners can save up to thirty percent off their ... electricity bill not also were companies are the same will make sure you get the ... and\n... you're home for more information that\nMight be paid the ... the schedule unreasonable or a valuation today\nA\nBig deal back weekends from six to ten the best\nIn the seventies with the music professor Rob re only able to\nTalk of Connecticut doubled only our sci am WBRC FM HD threes Hartford new evidence resorting to W.

minutes ago and then\nAh MSNBC now it says on the screen Trump\n... wouldn't be acceptable to Kavanaugh lied to Senate I said they're discussing this uh apparently right now uh I don't know of MSNBC is gone the New York times route ... are just starting to understand what's going on and again this is going to be\nAnd one of these big stories it says the president has long sold themselves as a self made billionaire but at times investigation found that he received at least four hundred Thirteen million in today's dollars from his father's real estate empire much\nOf it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties\nPresident Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the Nineteen nineties including the instances of outright fraud that greatly increase the fortune he received from his parents and investigation by the New York times is found\nThe uh Mr Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self made billionaire and then he has long insisted that his father the legendary New York city builder friend the Trump provided almost no financial help\n\nThe times investigation\nBased on a vast trove of confidential tax returns\nAnd financial records reveals that Mr Trump receive the equivalent today of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day\nI well first of all\nI'm curious on vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records\n[noise] watched the first question here who the hell revealed\nOr how they held to the New York times get their hands on a quote vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records somebody had to give this to the New York times\nThat's what I Want to know where\nAnd of course we're not going to find out and I imagine the president of the comments on this is going to talk you know called the failing New York times fake news of the times continues to say much of this money came to Mr Trump because he helped his parents dodged taxes he had a sibling set up a sham\nCorporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents\nRecords in interviews show records indicate that Mr Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more he also help formulate a strategy\nTo undervalue is parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings\nThese maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service the time south\nThe president's parents Fred and Mary Trump transferred well over one billion dollars in wealth to their children which could have produced a tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate then imposed on gifts\nAnd the inheritance is\nThe Trump painted a total of fifty two point two million or about five percent tax according to records\n\nThe president declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for the articles of the Trump knew this was coming\nSo clearly New York times and working on this for weeks and they've gone to Trump for comments or the president knew that it was just a matter of time before the New York times came out with something regarding his taxes but a lawyer for Mr Trump Charles Jay harder\nProvided a written statement on Monday one day after the time sense of detailed description of its findings the New York times allegations of fraud and tax evasion are one hundred percent falls and highly defamatory Mr harder sent\nThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times based it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate\n[noise] [noise] so there you go that's uh just um [noise]\n[noise] that's just a a a chunk here let's say the president's brother Robert Trump issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family\nAnd says are\nGives me I'm choking a little bit here [laughter] uh it says our dear father Fred see Trump passed away in June of Nineteen Ninety nine\nA loving mother Mary Ann from passed\nAway in August two thousand all appropriate gifts then estate tax returns were filed\nAnd the require taxes were paid our father's estate was closed in two thousand one by both the Internal Revenue service and the New York state tax authorities and our mothers estate was closed in two thousand for our family has\nNo other comments on these matters that happened more than twenty or something\nAnd would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents and may God rest their souls\nSo this is the call from the president's brother are surviving brother this is Robert 'cause he had a brother that died of alcoholism\n\nAnd also listen [noise] do I believe that from and and the Trump team and the Trump corporations that they are wielding deal on taxes I feel like they can do it happens\nIs it this degree of fraud the New York times is claiming who I mean they claimed to have the goods they claimed to have the documents again the big question here is who gave the documents have they get a hold of this material also oh we'll vi us investigate because\nA while you always hear that all the IRS doesn't go you know of they don't come back more than seven years or or typically now I I think it's you know after three or four years you can get rid of tax documents\nBut here's the issue [noise]\nSo you have a statute of limitations on on certain things when it comes to taxes by ...\nWhen it comes to fraud my understanding is that there is no statute of limitations so if fraud can be proved it you're not protected by oh the clock has run out on yet\nSo I don't believe there's when it comes to the IRS taxes that if there is fraud that statute of limitations applies eight hundred eight so we'll see what happens here we'll see what Trump commenting is going to be I I Know is going to be asked about it the question is\nWill the president comment and will the IRS poke around them and what's going to be the story you\nTides or the FBI investigation or incidentally the lawyer for Deborah Ramirez accusing number two is saying that they don't think that the FBI is conducting a serious investigation I I think that's insulting\nI I'm Sorry I don't think Christopher Wray the FBI Director with\nEyes and scrutiny upon him and his agency on multiple levels I don't believe\nThat the FBI would attempt any kind of a a sham investigation here\nOn the word we have is that the FBI's file report from its misconduct inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh\nWill be available for senators only not the public this is according to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell he said this earlier today are also a there was a closed door lunch with Republicans earlier today\nAnd they\nClaim they did not know exactly when the FBI would finish their investigation but it was suggested according to multiple sources is being reported by the hill that it could happen as early as Wednesday so the FBI could be done with their investigation\nTomorrow which would certainly you know leave a couple of days and clearly they're not going down this list of twenty three you're twenty four individuals that the Republicans are demanding\nThat are interviewed and investigated by the FBI\nOr weren't eight hundred and eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide nobody here on Smith eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is the nationwide number if you'd like to get in on Trump and taxes Trump and cabinet cabin on the investigation a\nCompany you know all of that we have the Kamala Harris\nBut I mean folks there so much every day every day what ever I prep essentially it's like it's like clockwork would ever print that I've done for the hours and hours prior to show time a lot of that\nAh [laughter] it's like you served on a daily basis by a ... who were breaking news it's it's just incredible and also you know
