TV networks seem to be ignoring some of the best evidence out there that is coming in\nFrom folks and I thought I'd get ... draining on who's ... senior news analyst for the media Research Center ... glad to have you back on the program\nAre glad to be back with you and I mean on\nSo tell me about this there is one big piece of evidence in a letter that was written by the former boyfriend of ah Christine Ford or the the big TV networks seem to be ignoring to some extent tell us about that\nYeah basically a Fox News or got a copy of this letter or a a an ex boyfriend of of course in for a sense of the Senate Judiciary committee and it was basically him telling them listen you know when I was dating her for her for six years\nShe told me specifically things back contradict what she said in her testimony up the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a namely that you know she was asked specifically by the\nProsecutor Rachel Mitchell did you have you ever advised anyone on how to take a polygraph test or anything like that and Christine Ford said now but her ex boyfriend in this letter says no actually she told me in detail about\nActually advising people on ... how to do a polygraph test on what it entails and how to prepare for it and you know the whole process so that seems like a you know glaring contradiction with what she testified under oath about\nYeah she was trying to do if you lie under circumstance like that it's perjury even though it was before Congress and not before a court and this wasn't just a man who dated her\nSome of that six years they lived together so they were in close proximity and they were they were at that level of a relationship he actually\nSaid in one of the cases I witnessed Dr Ford held Monica McLean her best friend at the time prepare for a potential polygraph exam she explained in detail what to expect how they work and help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nThat's a significant answer because she directly contradicted that under sworn testimony and yet how much\nTime or the networks spending on that any at all\nWell ABC and CBS or completely ignored it this morning on our morning shows and uh NBC it was\nMentioned by Megan Kelly who I have to give main kind of credit she has been one of the only people on the blog ... and I was actually\nTrying to be a journalist about this story and cover all the facts are coming in so she covered the today show did not cover it so from seven AM to nine AM you could not find the story on NBC\nAt nine am you know once every body is at work no longer at home watching the\nShow then that's when finally Megan Kelly\nThe story to light on on NBC or for them you know a minute or so and that was it so yeah they have not touched the story really and they're not very interested in the\n... ah I'm Talking to college running from the media research on the other issue because and I want people to understand why I think this is so significant\nAnd that is if you have a case that is entirely he said she said in other words there aren't any other witnesses there's no physical evidence of the crime of this solved that she says Brett Kavanaugh committed against or thirty six years ago so you have\nTo either trust her testimony or trust his testimony is being accurate so it's very important to evaluate whether somebody is trustworthy and whether or not they tell the truth um she also had testified in was questioned about the after\nEffects of this terrible\nYou know incident that happened and she described the Jews claustrophobic that her new how she insisted had to have to separate front doors instead of one and that she was so you know frightened\nOf of or claustrophobic that she couldn't fly for the most part could not fly on airplanes except in extreme occasions or this letter from the boyfriend\nA contradicts that doesn't [noise]\n[noise] yeah no basically it's it's ... yeah she said that the second front door was right as a result of you know the trauma related to this incident but\nIt turns out well not all of that separate front door was so you know she could see clients you know have have been doing a separate entrance uh when she went\nYou know the clients at home I mean she's a psychologist so it like that was the ... the ... it was very practical professional reason that really does not match with the reasoning that she gave in our test\nRight and she also also the the question about flying I I knew that early on it was established that while she said she almost was incapable of flying that you'd actually gone on vacation flight tour she flew to French Polynesia she flew to Costa Rica and the boyfriend describes that they took frequent\nFlying trips together even including one on a small propeller plane there apparently she was able to do that\nBut she was telling the Senate Judiciary committee that she might have to drive from California to Washington DC because she was so frightened of flying on airplanes\n[noise] yeah now and I mean yeah that was one of those things that was even for a fact checked in real time by Rachel Michel ... pointed out well you you have flown on other occasions we we know you have so why you know why the kind of wire you suddenly afraid of flying you know in this situation so yeah I mean there's\nA ... and the media has been so obsessed with trying to harvest every single word phrase that Brett Kavanaugh use\n... meanwhile there's these glaring contradictions that you know Christine for you know has made here in in her testimony according to this this ah ... ex boyfriend or ... you know they should be examining that\nJust as they should be scrutinizing that just as much as they are scrutinizing everything Brecht animal have to say\nYou know I saw a new twist and I call you'll have to be watching for you know that the FBI's review or their further background check I think is the way they're describing it was delivered to the White House so short time ago today\nThey expected a copy of it will be sent over to Capitol Hill here shortly\nBut then I just saw Richard Blumenthal the man who himself\nYou know the senator Who Lied about his service in Vietnam he had said that he served in Vietnam during the war he did not in fact serve in Vietnam during the war he lied about his service he's now on suggesting that he's read the other six background checks there were ... done on judge Kavanaugh ended their full of\nOther reasons to question whether or not they should vote on this\nDo you think Mitch McConnell is going to get to a vote this week and do you think this justice is going to be confirmed [noise]\n[noise] well yeah I think it's it's there was only a new twist and turn every every day with the story I mean it's it's you never know what what what they're going to come up with ... but uh\nI mean really everyone's watching you know of course Collins Murkowski flake there the the undecided vote see are so I mean you know Richard Blumenthal and the rest of the Democrats are already said hey we are not only for this guy and I'm not a lot\nSo uh you know they're not really a ... the votes matter here so uh you know we will see I mean according to people like Jeff Flake they kinda just they want to see the report and\nAssuming they are comfortable with it they they seem like they are we would be ready to vote for him but we will see certainly the media as important or something on the scale this whole time doing the Democrats bidding using democratic talking points to try and lobby\nAlong those transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice led to the sexual assault of a five year old girl the investigation is happening in Decatur, Georgia which opened last month signals a major development in the education secretaries policies on trade\nBetsy devise has handled things differently than the previous administration the complaint alleges that the girl was assaulted in the girl's bathroom at ... elementary school by a boy who is identified as and this\nIs where these things get even stranger he's identified as gender fluid which means\nHe could be male he could be female he may decide from time to time\nThat he's a boy and he may decide from time to time that he's a girl the complaint was filed in may with the help of the alliance defending freedom which is a conservative group that is filed many lawsuits challenging school district transgender bathroom policies nationwide\nAnd I would tell you that over the last two years probably the suspect these subject that has generated the greatest number of emails the greatest number of tweets the greatest number of Facebook post directed to me has been about this subject because so many parents out there\nTo look at the policies and they say you are creating a situation that is at best\nUncomfortable for my daughter or son at worst it puts them at physical risk of harm understand what's happening target the big retail store got all kinds of heat and probably deservedly so because they said we're going to honor transgender policies in our bathrooms in other words\nA man who dresses as a woman and calls himself a woman and says he identifies as a woman is free to use the ladies' room and the target stores as I said at best that situation if everyone behaves themselves is at best uncomfortable for some people because you could imagine\nWhen a mother is going shopping a target takes her little daughter into the ladies' room and see someone who is clearly not a lady is a man and is using the restroom that's going to be an uncomfortable situation [noise]\nAt worst it may provide an opportunity for people who are up to no good to use that kind of access to sexually access\nOr to molest or at at the very least to harass\nLittle girls and that's wrong\nNow from the email files today by the way the email address is talk of Lars Larson dot com pat pond says Lars turnabout fair play is there any way the Democrats can be investigated with the same gusto\nThat they're having judge Kavanaugh investigate I bet it would change their tune real quick there is plenty that they are being investigated for right now including dying Feinstein's I think totally illegitimate decision to hold back information from that Senate Judiciary committee for months\nUntil she finally dropped it at the last minute that was the accusation by Christine Ford against Brett Kavanaugh Dianne Feinstein knew about it\nShe kept it close to the vest\nShe agreed that she was going to allow this to be an

background\nReview of bread cabin on Christian Ford has now been delivered to the White House a copy of that is going to go to Capitol Hill they're going to take a look at a tomorrow Mitch McConnell already says there will be a vote on friday\nOr Saturday about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and where does that leave our friends in the Democratic party well it leaves them kind of grasping at straws\nThere are saying well some of us had read the other six background checks done on judge Brett Kavanaugh all of which cleared him for the high level government job jihad to places like the White House and on the federal court of appeals one of the most sensitive positions in America and\nThey're they're combing through those things you know if they can find some other kind of dirt that they can sling a judge Kavanaugh and I think the Democrats realized there quickly being made to look like fools\nThey don't have anything to depend on the now well they're saying that previous background checks may show inappropriate behavior they will smear this man no matter what you know this is one of those situations where\nThe bit into a situation and they didn't know exactly what what what they were going to get what they got was they had hoped they would scare Brett Kavanaugh into withdrawing his own name or Donald Trump into withdrawing his name for him and they didn't get that so they had to stick with it\nThey say we know is there as I told you to some extent they seem like that young boy who always wanted his former dad\nTo give him a pony and on a couple of nights before Christmas Eve the farmer has a big pile of my newer delivered to the front driveway of the farm and on Christmas morning the farmer walks out and he sees a little boy on top of the manure pile and he's got to shovel and he's ... he's digging with all his might\nKnow what his dad says what are you doing out there he says that I Know there's a pony in here somewhere\nYou know Democrats haven't found the pony yet but there sure are going to try no matter what it costs them and of course Brett Kavanaugh on his reputation\nWe've got other things to talk about those two and all and budget calls on any of those and of course on this program naysayers go to the head of the law in China stole secrets from America and spy don't America for decades but we're American companies helping them do it I'll give you one view on that a watchdog group says that a feeding Democrat\nWhere the mission to exist today\nOur country means tomorrow [noise]\nTo spare\nFew\n\nSeven thousand

Lars Larson show still tracking these latest events in foreign South Carolina where we understand that a man is in custody who is apparently killed one cop and a wounded at least for others will get your details fans\nAre available but this is now happen sometime ago about an hour ago that we got word he was in custody and the CNN of course is calling them the shooter and not a killer but it appears that he is a cop killer and perhaps\nWell we can just say a prayer for the other police officers were wounded in I mentioned a moment ago uh the emergency presidential alert\nSystem was tested today and I got that message and it kind of reminded me that uh uh about a year ago I was on a flight to Washington DC and with my producer\nAnd we're on a regular commercial flight we're sitting back and coach where we usually are\nAnd ah and I we we were sitting there on the runway and the pilots said we've got a ground stop we can't move the plane to the gate and unload all you folks because we've got a thunderstorm going on and right before all the rain and the wind and the lightning and thunder rolled over the top of that plane\nI saw something I'd never seen before you know usually when you land in a plane people pull out their cell phone\nAnd they called the person who's going to pick 'em up there for the call their sweetheart like I Do and tell Tina that I'm safely on the ground every single phone\nIn that plane lit up at the same instance lit up and began ringing all the same time we all ... looked at each other and laugh\nIt was a thunderstorm alert and that's the kind of thing you'd be routinely in different places now we have the ability of the president of the United states to send a message to the whole country when I wanted to know what our tech expert Brian Westbrook thought about that Brian welcome back to the program [noise]\nThanks ... and if it sounds a little bit louder I'm walking out of a conference we had here in Seattle, Washington I was at the gate choir summit and there was about a thousand of us are gathered in the room\nAnd an eleven Eighteen Pacific time when the alert came through we were watching that alert of light up everyone's phone we had everyone stand up and kind\nOf a fun little moment though it was an interesting experiment it was a great use of technology was kind of we we're not sure how would play out would it be on time with everybody receive I'm at the same time\nAnd for the most part you just heard sample set up about a thousand and you can watch the video on my Twitter feed a ... Brian Westbrook you it was really funny just to watch everybody stand up and within about a minute I Would say\nUh everyone received the alert a and it looked like most everyone in the room received it we didn't see a whole lot of people that didn't I think some people were buried in their work or checking their email and not paying attention to us on stage but other than that everybody seemed to receive dealer\nAnd seemed to receive in this case not very important information it was just a a test message no action required a and then I made a joke earlier today I said please now everybody let's not hit reply all\nI think I Would just be of course not only can you not reply to this message which I think some folks would would love to be able to reply to a presidential text message but you also cannot unsubscribe unlike the thunderstorm warning that you talked about you can opt out of those you can also opt out of amber alerts you cannot\nHowever and and I think rightly so opt out of presidential lurch there is a threshold you're not going to be hearing political messages they tell us these are for extreme cases a major natural disasters nuclear attack\nThat sort of thing hopefully we never received another one of these but that system is in place and it seems like any way it worked for the most part I've been tracking\nA couple of isolated incidents where bones stopped working for some period of time uh obviously those can be some bugs and the software is going to need to improve but generally speaking it sounds like everything was the best\nAs long as you're in the modern era now Brian I did get an email from a guy who's a regular email where I got about nine hundred thousand emails a day and this man emails from time to time I recognize who's handle any road to me and said it I didn't get the message but all my co workers\nIt is or you have an older phone don't chew and he may have been one of those guys like my father in law was until recently who stuck with his tried and true flip phone and he wasn't going to give it up and I my father in law finally gave it up and he seems to be enjoying it ah\nIt but this guy said that and I said well you just need to get a new phone how old do you have any idea how old the phone would have to be that it wouldn't get that message [noise]\nAnd actually doesn't have to be that old I think I think and I'm ... I'm just making this up but I have in my head that it's about five years old if you have a phone that that old you may not be able to receive these messages because of course the software has to be built into the phone but if you have an Android or an Iowa phone\nOf really any generation like any recent generation if it's currently supported you'll definitely have access to this feature a so you're talking about folks that don't have smartphones or have phones that are so old they're not being supported and are not being updated since this technology was rolled out a number of years ago\nA and I also want to say that in some ... 'cause you can be in areas where you just want to receive a signal\nOr the ... there were a lot of folks joking earlier on social media today that if you put your opponent airplane mode well then you won't received a message either so there are different cases where you wouldn't received a message but I gotta say if I'm near anyone at all unless I\nHave my head in the sand or I'm Out on a remote island I Will hear about is whether it's not for myself it's from the Ninety percent or Ninety five or Ninety nine percent of the people in the room that do get the alert hopefully one of them will tell me to take cover necessary\nHey let me ask you about something you know we're doing to the point when when there was why fight was first available a lot of hotels always charge for these days why probably is becoming like color t._v. and electric lights [laughter]\nEvery every hotel is giving at least some level of service airplanes are on their way to doing that in fact there's a new a new satellite system that I understand it's going to seven or eight hundred satellites are going to get launched\nWhere they say that stuff's going to go right to airplanes and at some point probably airplane why five will become at least at the basic level will be a a regular part of the service\nIf we had been hooked up to air airplane why fi I use that occasionally to work while I'm flying from coast to coast would I've got the signal then [noise]\nI Believe so and it was ... I actually talked to a friend of mine who's a flight attendant for one of the major carriers and he said he learned today and and he thought I was surprised to learn you weren't really surprised that over half\nThe plane had not with their phones in airplane mode went off\nDuring the flight I don't I don't know for sure if he was connected to why if I if they were on the ground or or or low enough that they were able to pick up to tell you that that goes but I thought that was kinda funny little anecdote out about these emergency alerts as we know which ones have you have your phone on silent and still receive Dillard I imagine that was a little bit of chaos on the airplane\nThey let me ask you this ... there was a big alert about Facebook and cybersecurity is this what should people do about this vote\nThough there's been some advice floating around and I I've actually subscribe to this for some time that you should not use Facebook to sign into other websites and here's why because you're putting all of your eggs in Facebook's basket if you will you're trusting them to rent to keep your information safe and to keep your sign in and your log and secure\nAnd unfortunately they've shown as recently that they may not be the best equipped to do that or they may not be doing as good of a job of keeping your information secure ah with with some fifty million accounts being compromised we don't know if they have access\nTo these third party sites when used Facebook to sign into another site and that's actually even more troubling in my opinion than than them being able to say yes you were a compromise the fact that they just don't know it's a little scary so my advice would be this using email to sign up creating unique password\nFor everything and if you say to me than I Know you're going to well that's a pain I Can't\nRun oh no no I Am I use different logging names and and and I do use for everything I tried to call in Munich\nAnd you should and if you don't if you're not as diligent as lawyers or myself what you do is you sign up for one of these password manager is like one pass\nOr even use your operating system to do it for you take the heavy lifting off you but if you're not using unique user names and passwords for every ... Iran as soon as I have access to your\nUh you know mom and pop a online shopping by compromise that information I now have access to your bank I now have access to your social media profiles your email everything and once you use the same password and log in a one site if you hear nothing else\nWow the guy really was a bad\nGuy it would have to be something so bad\nThat you would get well until until the until and unless the Democrats have a majority in both the house in the Senate is not going to happen\nPeriod and even if they did get a majority and in both house and Senate the idea that you get enough Democrats who would say whatever it is that he is said to have done ten or twenty or thirty or almost forty years ago is ...\nMove him extremely unlikely very very unlikely that answer your question\nIt it it does um but my main concern is um you know all of this came up what one of the week before his final confirmation you know it didn't\nIt came up in July and then a Democrat Senator by the name of Feinstein or as the president culture Feinstein or decided to sit on the information and I think that was a calculated move because she thought if I bring this up in July we would they would have routinely asked\nHim about a behind closed doors and said did you ever sexually assault this woman she says you did and he would have said no and that might have been the end of it at that point the Democrats could have decided to go for the Hail Mary pass and say we're going to ask\nHim about it in public under oath and they could have asked them again they could have had it investigated just as the FBI's looked into additional facts over the last few days and the same result would have happened and instead\nThey thought and I'm telling you I I can ... I Would bet money that this is what they did this is what Feinstein did she said\nI'm going to hold this information I'm going to wait as she did until all of the hearings are over our opportunities to officially ask\nHim about it and have all been gone by and we're about to vote they were within days of the vote and then I'm going to drop this bomb and what they've become accustomed to is this kind of guerilla warfare this blitzkrieg approach where you say if we drop a big enough nasty\nIn a sex bomb on Brett Kavanaugh either she will decide to withdraw his own name saying I don't want to drag my family and myself through that or the president will look at it and say wow I'm not going to stand up for that\nI I Know this is going to be a rough go so the president withdraws his name or Kavanaugh was draws his name it was basically a giant bluff like playing poker you you you don't have any cards in your hand you shut your whole pile of chips into the middle and you hope that everybody else at the table says wow\nYou know Kyle must have a a one heck of a hand he's gotta he's got a royal flush or he's got something special in that hand and they all cave in what they didn't count on is that we have a different America today at least for some people we have a president with a backbone\nWho doesn't take Bernie Sanders lightly and we have people like judge Kavanaugh who do not take this stuff\nAnd just immediately cave in now you and I both know there are plenty of Democrats who cave easily and there are plenty of rhino Republicans who cave easily they were counting on a cave in so that they never have to actually prove\nThat they had a hand that they had a you know the four of a kind or something and it didn't work and now they don't know what to do and they're trying to ... they're they're trying to salvage this\nGreat just to clarify for it actually came out with this little July when the Democrats long well\nNot came out within ... anonymously made the complaint to her rap or member of Congress who brought it to Feinstein and then they sat on it they did not ask the FBI\nWhat five tiny July, July yeah okay that's that's my also although it you

emails go to talk and Lars Larson dot com will things to Bernie Sanders and Ocasio Cortez young Alexandria socialism and seeing a bit of a rebirth among us millennials and\nThat's been a tough one for me to wrap my head around so I thought we'd talk to David to row who's the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and the publisher of the independent review David welcome back to the program\nThank you Lars let me hear\nWell I'm I'm Glad you're here too but when I'm not blind of is to see millennials attaching themselves to socialism\nAnd I guess I see this is kind of a watershed change in America are I think I can speak for myself accurately the when I left high school about forty years ago and everybody would which wasn't a darn good job in the late Nineteen seventies where the tail end of Jimmy Carter's Virgil recession and things were looking kind of bleak before Ronald Reagan came in\nBut I remember almost every one I knew in school couldn't wait to move out of mom and dad's\nHouse and strike out on their own weather was to college or a job get their own apartment pay their own bills be responsible for themselves what's happened between then and now that it has millennials say a word we don't want to move out of mom and dad's house and by the way we'd like the government to pay our bills for us in a social setting\n[noise] well a lot has happened uh\nThe government is grown enormously not just in spending and regulation but in debt and the opportunities that the millennial generation phase have been greatly reduced or as a result there they've come to become somewhat cynical a\nUnderstandably and we have found\nThat according to the major surveys of millennials which includes the work of Pew Research center and the Harvard Institute of politics that millennials have a landed on essentially five questions um because\nThey feel constrained with little opportunity and the five questions are how they can pay off their student loan debt how can they get a good job how come they ever afford a house\nHow can they afford healthcare that that that is kind of uh the right for them and why is the government spying on them and [noise] the results of this is a millennials have lost confidence in sort of the American system\nUm and ah David looking around for answers but they don't know who to trust\nSo the ah course millennials were not around\nPretty much during the Cold War they didn't know about the reality of socialism in the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc and so forth and even in China in some respects [noise] so to them the idea is how do\nThey make ends meet and uh as human beings they're open to getting free stuff so the other factor that came into play was they are coming out of the uh\nThe public school system and out of college as a base for the narrative they're taught as the progressive narrative that government just solution to everything and they believe that they've been taught to believe that the the two thousand eight\nRecession the great recession was caused by capitalism and free markets in other words\nThat greed drove this problem and as a result the American system bailed out people who are responsible for it even though the reality of it is that it was federal policies that created the bubble and then the bailout just made it um continue essentially\nA instead of having the economy correctly\nAdjust to the problem so what we found\nWas there's an opportunity actually to reach millennials ... it'll generation is the largest generation American history it's about eighty three million Americans and since they don't watch the six o'clock news they don't read the newspaper magazines\nSo their information from YouTube as far as news and entertainment\nSo we developed a video series to target and when he does not so much a series of videos that is preaching to them about what to think but more of a story that starts to get features millennials figuring out\nThese five questions and it's funny it's a satire and I'm\nThe first season of it uh the series is called love of a\nHas reached over eight point two million combining views on YouTube we've just released the second season about a week ago and it's similar to the sky rocket up and we're we target mainstream millennials in the process and the results of this is I'm\nYoung people seeing through the the narrative the progress of narrative and also the view that they can get something for nothing\nIs there a possibility that we could go back and reach his on this all sounds great and I'd like to help you know remind people of it and have them pass it on can we go back\nTo some of the kids as early as high school and persuade them that they're being sold a bill of goods when they're told that all of you should go to college and I think that's that's a real mistake because teachers push it because they are largely college educated married the other college educated professionals usually\nAnd then they tell their students who the only way to go college and what we have\nIs a college degree is diminishing value in part because so many people have them they used to be a relatively rare thing and I've talked to a ... said\nRealistically what percentage of of workers in a society like ours should have degrees and they say you know twenty eight maybe twenty eight percent of most ... thirty at the top and the other Seventy percent\nShould have some skills and training but not for years of college that ends up being worth as you point out the reason they have a tough time paying for their college\nIs they find out it doesn't enhance your earning ability enough to even pay for itself it'd be like buying a machine that produces ten dollar a gallon gasoline you say well what am I going to do with that\nI can you know I ... I I'm paying a bunch of money for a machine that makes gasoline that's more expensive than the gasoline I can buy at the palm why would I Do that\nWhy would I buy a college degree that costs a hundred thousand dollars that you know boosts my pay by three dollars an hour it'll take me the most of my life to pay for it and that doesn't make sense and and get I get to them early\nIn the escalation of college tuition cause has gone up\nI don't have the numbers in front of me but a a huge the largely um increase over any other major factor that people are facing as far as cost and the pay is of course the norm is as you mentioned over time with the student loan debt problem [noise] ah\nWhat Obama did was he nationalize\nThe student loan programs uh believe it or not in the Obamacare measure I'm part of the reason they did that was because\nAh they actually viewed Obamacare as a way to appeal to young people and get them to become dependent on the federal government and hence to keep voting them in a free other various ... century measures but you're right it's it's a great distortion and uh the dumbing down of the standards\nOf of universities and colleges is enormous I'm\nMost colleges in not just the so called grievance studies of gender race and so forth but also in many of the social sciences has been taken over by a sort of a cultural Marxist view um that really doesn't\nEducate people and miss educate people so that's part of the story of the love of series is is college where they worth it and if it is why it's worth it and how to change that ah how do you see through the the the the false narrative that people are being given\nBut the nice thing about the love of series is that is funny and is enjoyable and his millennials figuring out these questions in their lives um\nThe story essentially is of a young woman in college his name is Alexis she and her best friend\nRight and and I was going to say that if you go back I think it's to maybe Nineteen eighty was the number of guns in private possession closer to two hundred million in about Nineteen eighty so we come home come\nForward or not quite forty years and we have doubled the number of guns in private possession in America which by the anti gunners logic if you double the number of guns you're gonna see twice as much violent crime or or maybe more so and instead\nWe've seen a drop over the last thirty or forty years in violent crime in this country\nBut the evidence the evidence of the number is is that more guns in in the hands of law abiding citizens means dramatically less crime\nYou're exactly right liars and and and the thing to remember is that almost any statistics that you look at for example in New York Times for their own report they talked about in two thousand seven team there were eleven thousand people murdered ... by criminals with guns in that same year the FBI\nCame out now granted these are very conservative FBI numbers they said it at a hundred and twelve thousand a non police individuals defended their lives with guys now if you look at research by Dr\nGary collectors they're significantly even more but even those ultra conservative numbers ten times ... to ten times more good things happen with guns and bad things\nYeah and and and I guess this this suggests that if we could get even more guns if we made government policies more friendly\nToward people having concealed carry I mean Tim you know I make a nice living you make a nice living if I I bought a new Walter pistol last week uh I have a number of pistols\nBut what I Wonder about is the ability of the average person out there who lives in a place like California where they make it very expensive to be able to get a permit even the bad\nAnd makes it a little bit ridiculous because you have to take classes and you have\nTo do this and you have to do that by the time you're all done an average person might have to drop a thousand dollars all totaled to be able to have the permit have\nThe gun practice and and be properly equipped to do that well for an awful lot of wage earners a thousand dollars of discretionary income is is a big chunk of the family's budget over even a couple of years even though it is is great security but if you can afford it\nI was I couldn't agree more I mean the fact\nThat if you have to spend that much money to exercise a natural born right I eat the permits and all that stuff that's that's just wrong especially in the United states of America we're in our country is is based on the concept of of a personal freedoms and and so another point the ironic thing is that the cities and states that have\nThe highest levels of crime or the areas where the toughest support the the law abiding citizens to get the guns and and that's I mean to me that's a travesty\nWell and I know that because I have a nice income actually kind of live in a Heinz fifty seven neighborhood during nice houses that are not so nice has their\nHouses and ... D nicer there my house and their houses that are not as nice\nAnd I think these are people who work hard for you know to make their living and uh and they should have the same kind of protection I Do even though if you live in a nice neighborhood you're ... you're a lot less likely to fall victim to crime the ugly truth is\nThe most criminals are poor and most criminals prey on the poor people around them in poor neighborhoods and you know the the stance bear that out so if you say you know if we could make it easier and say\nThat the government says we'll waive the fee for getting a concealed carry permit if you have an income below such and such not give them any money but just say if you want to get the permit man you're below a certain income you know we we give out free cheese we give out food stamp\nAll these other things how 'bout waving the fee for concealed carry permits for people below say below the average uh in in income and make it easier for them to do it and put the fear of God in all the criminals out there\n[noise] ... well you're exactly right because that is the only thing that puts your daughter criminals that is a a an affirmative violent\nResponse that's what they're afraid of and the good news I mean that's an interesting spinning you're putting out a large but the good news is that there's many states that are actually going in that direction but even more broader lay in the sense of constitutional carry so right now we have twelve states twelve states that have pretty much said All right we trust our citizens to carry guns you have to ask\nFor a permit you don't have to ask us if we can defend ourselves and I personally think that Spanta\nI Love it it's constitutional carrying now imagine what would happen in Chicago if they tried that experiment but I Know that rama manual and his crowd would not go for Tim where can people find the U.

[noise] there were a different question\nIf they asked a different question and she answered that question truthfully she would pass a\n\nVideo and audio the methodology of that test is important\nAnd so if you use that as part of the proved to cooperate that it did happen\nThat you were telling other people because it doesn't cooperate the crime you know it just it it just and we can't even get to the point of her ... the ... the the what she says his cooperation that she had been talking about this but she won't even let that evidence be seen\nAll that evidence the scene which is sorry the therapist knows you brought it up you use that as evidence yet so you've been talking about it right you said you said certain things but you haven't released everything that the therapist has\nSorry when you make the accusation and you say this is what backs\nUp not the crime because you have nothing to cooperate the crime so you're you came in with your lawyers as the secondary\nA point you were going to make well maybe you know where that hoping that the ... this is my cooperate you and they didn't so your second point was but I've been talking about it for years and that should give me credibility and you won't release that evidence to the people who\nAre the judges in this case mhm well then you lose even more credibility and that's why when they say she's credible when the members of the Democrats sensation Judiciary Committee say she's credible well you can't make that case because on every single instance when you want to get to the credibility by getting more evidence that she actually has\nHer lawyers refused to hand it over because if she is telling the truth and has been all along why would you refused to hand it over in fact why would you not voluntarily handed over without being asked\nBecause here's the proof here's everything you need to know here are my notes here the therapists notes here are here is the audio\nOr video from the lie detector test you would be out to prove that this happened\nIsn't she out to prove it happened ... well you you're going to hand over everything voluntarily why with her lawyers not encourage her to do that listen doctor for this is going to vindicate you this is going to show why would you not been doing that\nOr at least it sets a at least to set some past\nThe ... have right it's it's the most evidence that you had that you even been talking about it is and you decided to use you and your lawyers decided to use it as evidence yet you won't present all of the evidence it helps build your case right it doesn't work that way right in which case to begin with that would give you a little path\nTo go down and you're saying no sorry you can't have\nThat out I mean you would have you would want to provide everything that was within your control to provide what the other people say in terms of people corroborating her story or or or or not that's on them you can't can you can't compel them to a testify or you can't compel them\nA doctor for can her lawyers can compel them to talk to the FBI or any of that but what they can do what is in within their control is turning over\nEvery piece of evidence that you have\nIn your control and why would you not do that that helps to build your case you right there he doesn't prove anything but if you're a doctor for his position you're looking to be vindicated didn't show that this happened because you're being criticized and your credibility has been criticized\nAll along the way you have not proven your case you would want to turn that over ...\n... if you're telling the truth you would want to turn over everything that you have it's everything within your power and that's it that it's all you have\nBut it would be your ... your best attempt at being believed here\nI I I really believe that uh that I well I think if I was a betting man that the odds that the reason that\nForged lawyers want her to talk to the\nFBI again is because she's going to remember people more witnesses here and and I think that Ramirez too because we're ... said well we directed the FBI to more witnesses out there because the whole point is to extend\nYes even in like a witness is okay right we can do it while you have to talk to those because on the app y'all come back and say well we had to look let's come back right away the limitation we couldn't find these people well then\nWe can vote on it until we find all these people to find out because they claim that body of additional witnesses and the whole thing is just keep extending this weekend and\nAnd we can't vote on it until we find all these people to find out because they claim that body of additional witnesses and the whole thing is just keep extending this week in and week out are getting what get away you\nKnow who said on Sunday night on ... on sixty minutes forget what they said about we think this is fair the week you know the the FBI or what they called investigation\nIs the one week we believe is fair yeah I'd I don't expect that position to hold if indeed you start you it comes back and it does not a show anything different than what we already know\nRight but I Do think that that's what's going on to say what you know they're white ... because the remembers his lawyer well we wanted them to some new witnesses out there and some new people to talk to and I bet you that's why for lawyers want her to talk oh there are I I just remembered more witnesses to this whole thing this ... and then you have to start investigation over again\nAnd then while the FBI needs to work on this another week and investigate these people or do a background check on these people to and you just keep extending it look I Do not think that the goalpost at

Democrat\nAnd he was asking for the Judiciary Committee to correct to tweets\nThat claimed previous background checks on Kavanaugh contained no issues you know issues of sexual misconduct or alcohol abuse\nAll right and what was smart he uh was as\nWell what do you think\n... what are you going to say this is Durban nothing he said so you figure it out that's that's just my opinion maybe I'm wrong I don't know I don't think so but the ... a member\nOf a forged team said\nThat uh no such deliberate miscommunication took place Dr forwards legal team advised her of all the options the committee offered her she chose to testify before the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee so\nThere it is and uh we should have a decision by\nBy tomorrow and again that's just my own thought on this and I've a bottle that as closely as you have to do any of you have a thought of any of you reached a conclusion if you have\nGive me a call one eight eight eight five seven four to seven to three but it's a very\nVery interesting and Senator McConnell denied a request from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer for an F.\nB. I. briefing for all senators calling it\nUnprecedented and irregular and suggested ... Democrats would just use it as a pretext to delay the nomination ... that mean senators will be limited to the raw information\nOf an updated FBI background investigation of Kavanaugh leaving them to draw their own conclusions that is the story that has come again have to us here\nUh this morning [noise] and again if any of you have thoughts are you folks were right there in the beginning\n... have you have any thoughts it all plays the phones are open 'til you twenty five minutes after five one eight eight eight five seven four to seven to three well CBS\nSays at now will stay in Hartford for the next ten years how about that\nYes drugstore giant CBS plans to keep at his headquarters in Hartford\nFor at least the next ten years ... said the company will also maintain current staffing levels in Connecticut for the next four years and honor and a ... exiting\nThey'll ... they'll disrupt it\nYou get for the next four years in honor any ... exiting ... buildings rough Nick and pardon me a agreement ... has called Up Heartbreak\nHome since Eighteen fifty three that's right a long time in his statement or a lawyer said CBS help is just wrong corporate partner ... or the city and the state [noise]\nAnd we welcome\nIs long term commitment [noise]\nThe day's news is yet another positive step for Hartford ... and the capital region coming on the heels of several major job ... announcements ... in the past year I've been here says he is confident\nThat the city will continue to emerge as a hub [noise] as a hub\nFor his ... okay when he's seven minutes after the hour of five o'clock in the morning [noise] and ah we've got some calls ... ... calls coming in so let's take the first one this is Tom in West Hartford Tom good morning good morning\nOr good morning Brad the FBI basically is guided in a controlled by the department of justice and to believe that the FBI would totally ignore and I happen to agree with you in regards to this\nTotally ignore a Ford and not investigate or not a investigate the biggest the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee is ridiculous\n... is that that that's what I mean the FBI is going to just sit there and say\nOh no I ... I ... I they're not going to just sit on your horse and\nThey ... they ... there's the report as it comes in will definitely cover everything that they need to cover that they've been directed to investigate and that that report is going to be given to the center it's right it's not going to be released to the public for the simple reason\nThat this thing will go on for the next five years they'll pick it all apart and look at all the words and bend everything around like Democrats have been doing\nSo this way the ... the report is going to come in is going to probably cleared him\nI don't think it's going to a room and I think they do and I think he you know he's a powerful Democrat and uh they asked him how what are you going to say says nothing\nAnd another thing Brad okay this thing about you know the the court okay ... they had this report before they started a with all the questions that they were asking him nowhere on that report that at the same thing about sexual misconduct\nOr him being a truck okay and then\nWhen the ... the time he was um looked at by then when he went on to the court that he's serving a narrow that lower court yes there was no indication of that that neither\nAny had a complete and he had a complete physical he had a complete everything yeah it was this was and and the people not these Democrats okay now at\nThe end you'll you'll hear from our Democrats too right here in Connecticut but let them yell and scream\nAin't no bad on this one is are they like it goes the way it looks like it's going to go\nYeah well I don't have much in doubt that he's going to be confirmed\nI think he's on it of course he is yeah yeah I thought OK along\nThere but yeah it was just a a dog and pony show for Democrats that's all that's what\nWell anyway Chuck Schumer and that whole Chuck Schumer uh he uh is all upset because the FBI a briefing is not what he wanted you understand that\nYeah it's not one but you know it's not what he wanted but he's not in charge of the uh yeah that's right right\nThat's right it and I am just wondering you know when they do have to go and you see three or four of these Democrats end up turning and voting for cabinet are I Wonder how they the protestors are going to go storm them at the restaurant and storm than that in the Senate office I mean it it's disgusting that\nAll these Republicans have to have our security around them now at all times because the ... as well\nOffice I mean it's it's disgusting that all the Republicans have to have our security around about all kinds because\nWell you know again uh I don't think you know something I don't think you're going to see as much of it as you think because you know why why is that they've got an election coming up and if they don't watch it they're going to lose the whole thing\nOh yeah I I I think they've already overplay their hand\nI mean seriously they they they're not going to go to grace the I don't think because if they do they're they're they're they're not going to win the election while the I don't think I'm going to win and anyway but they're not going to win I Would I think they're going to get a ...\n... they're going to lose ... okay they're already going to lose in the Senate\nThough I mean hopefully we have a lot of the house and then we can get on\nThe president as far as the house vote goes it's going to be very close and I wouldn't be surprised if they won the house and I would have been my fried butter maybe because of the way they're acting now they'll lose the house to\nWrite because of the ... a lot more things than people out there that are that the Democrats are\nLike you know\nThey they could they could see just how absolutely corrupt their bed with this whole situation or well\nAnyway thank you for the call and a look at this is how it looks but you you'd never know until the actual word is there I I I think that he's going to make it I really do\nYep and I knew it you know me and

and you'd be surprised the number of\nPeople that I get it right here on the phone to a are very very disappointed very very upset and uh there there's there's just a feeling\nI mean this is just my feeling talking with a lot of the folks that says there's they they just want something that's going to work and I I don't know\nI I just think that this is a tremendous opportunity or to a to change things I Do I just got that gut feeling\nI I think it is two and A People's cat ... and ... all the people who are going to make the real difference here when they vote on November of four of the

upset with Connecticut you got to say\nIf you're upset with the Connecticut then you have to change the legislature of negative Republican change the governorship bank Republican let's see let's put their hands on the wheel live to see what happens\nAnd you know there are a lot of good candidates for the legislature that are out there especially in the eastern part uh somebody from the house a separate Melissa's that Ron ... is our number out running state Senate because with mirrors a\nMoved out of his district are and so you know that's a good person to get in the state Senate and we you know there was a pact with out by the A. R. P. it shows it they're dead heat between a\nA ... and ... or so it is going to be a very close\nRace ... going to be a powerful in this election that's anyway I got something I Want to pass along to you okay you're not going to talk about it or this this this morning\nDo you know this is the truth in accounting okay to choose an accounting\nRecord right now\nMassive taxpayer burden if\nWe had to do it I'm Talking about every single person\nConnecticut\nIf we had to do it I'm Talking about every single person in\nConnecticut Senator we would have to put in per person\nSo when we would be even fifty three thousand four hundred dollars\nPer person okay as far as Connecticut is concerned and this is why\nThey have become along with a couple of other states are they called it the St coal state but would you believe that I'm Out that's where we're at and nobody tells you that\nThat's unbelievable you know if I had to they could get or whether it's at thirty uh fifty three is the\n... three thousand I've got some George Logan at coming on and I've been reading about this and we are ranked forty nine in the country and this is a new analysis upstate financial health by truth in accounting so there it is\nWow yeah it's unbelievable ... trees awful lot of money you better you're going to look at it as a\nGreat guy could get him on for the time but is a great guy\nBut I mean when I look at the at the at at the cost of Connecticut are only twelve point one billion in assets and to pay eighty nine point one ... and bells\nAnd then the policy lapses because there's not you know that the the money is the gasoline as the engine that that makes the policy last if the policy will laugh and there was a lone twice the insurance carrier is going to write a nasty letter to the IRS\nTelling them that huge defaulted on along to the insurance carrier and the IRS is going to charge you an ordinary income tax on that forgiveness and blah\nBlah yeah\nAnd that's that's a shocker for like a lot of ... you know sometimes people have hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans and they let the policy that they don't realize what the consequences are so there I think that\nTo try to put it as succinctly as possible there are so many different aspects to a policy that require\nIf you want to be prudent have those policies checked at least every couple of years and when I say check check by an expert not chat give me the one piece of paper that says here's what my temperature is but run a series of what we call\nIn force ledgers or illustrations showing\nDifferent scenario of what happens if I pay this what if I Do this how much do I have to pay if I Want the policies laugh 'til a certain age and be able to review those things to avoid Ninety percent of policies not last into maturity\nNinety percent\nNinety per se but yeah I had a staff people guess how many policies and they they go I don't know ten percent twenty percent oh you mean term policies now I mean all policies altogether the entire gamut there is a very small percentage that last because\nThey're not being checked properly they're not being monitored properly and here's here's like you're sort of like the salt in the wound is that people\nFor the most part don't realize that they have an option\nLet's say that uh you know the estate tax laws changed pretty dramatically over the last Fifteen Years it used to be where you can transfer two million dollars tax free do your heirs and a lot of people bought insurance for people that maybe you had to states that was going to be more than two million dollars\nBecause insurance is an extremely and I'm a believer insurance is an extremely effective way to pay the taxes or the current transfer laws allow you to transfer twenty four million dollars for a couple\nTo their heirs and that amount is growing and so you know there's a very small percentage of families that have that kind of wealth you find a lot of people that have bought policies for a purpose\nAnd now they don't maybe feel they need them and they either let them lab so they turned them into the insurance carrier there's twenty two trillion dollars\nA year of policies lapsed or surrendered they could be sold to third parties for millions of dollars\nDavid I'll tell you something right now\nThe third parties for millions of dollars\nDavid I'll tell you something right now I had read about some of this stuff and that's the reason that I wanted to do a feature on my program here ah and and it's hard to believe but your double check this stuff and it's all true\nIt is\nAnd you're you're you're you're a big insurance area they're\nHuge huge not as big as it used to be but it's it's it's still pretty a pretty big butt and you know I'll tell ya I I Am concerned about people and I'm sure some of them are hearing this for the for the first time\nBut uh if you read some of this stuff you know you say wait a minute now what is that going to do to my insurance policy I just assume everything is okay but again a then uh\nWhat what was the one thing that turns you on like it did David\n[noise] well I had little you know\nBread I I like to try to be a problem solver you don't like uh that's my why why do I know why what what what makes me passionate about what I Do and I want to help people\nI Want to help them if they want to be more philanthropic I Want to help them but some people are living longer and you know medical expenses keep increasing its right we agency waste\nYou know there's just so much ways if you look at look at look at the city's major cities in the country who's got the biggest\nBuildings in New York City who's got the biggest buildings in Boston the biggest buildings in San Francisco the insurance company\nYou know if you're in a product that people were all year after year month after month and they're not collecting out of it yeah that's a pretty profitable once you're\nSaying I Would say so\nYeah so you know my my thing is ... let's try to help the consumers that are out there find the true value in their policies and not waste them and use and there's so many good things that you could use the money for\nBetter than having it just go to waste better than having it enrich the insurance carrier that that's their business\nWell David I'm Glad that I called you glad that I saw some of this information and I I just said well we'll see if it's\nYou know true or not the not checked it out a couple of other places too and that's why that's why I called today even a or we will talk again\nI I Would love to write I

I think they're just ... they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things are going to pan out I mean they the stall ... ... ...\nIs good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they'd been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's what I really believe or let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\nLaura I'm I just want to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful that Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left but\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing their jobs and pushing back not fighting the left on a consistent basis so when one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like uh\nYou know this shouldn't be the norm and not the exception so this is ... and the others were sent to Washington to two and world wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame that we don't do that\nThat's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like look\nA man helps an old lady across the street\n[laughter] you know our look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps an autistic kid in the\nIn the seven eleven or the other video of helping him stock things which is nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity that's that that is what we all should be doing so I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative things round people sort of it is nice but it's kind\nOf an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we used to know that\nWhen someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no apple\nSadly like so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your job on location and Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room [noise] people are applauding them as he's walking down the halls and hands shaking and like you just came back from war but\nHe made a speech and the committee defending\nThe nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where this is Dick Durban to senator Senator Grassley nowhere in any of these six Kevin ... FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior\nOr alcohol abuse he won some of that released he thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out miss characterize what's in these FBI find\nIt so it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in\nThis FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three Scotty the\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost an appreciation for actually how profound you're through all the political saturation of all you're on the back and forth out profoundly positive you exposure of the left for their their I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to you know to me they for power um\nIt's it's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll do literally anything to get there and what's happened in this capital earring is literally from what I you know for for the three years old and from what I can see\nThis is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that they it's their\nOwn destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I've got plenty of Democrat from that or it's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything they're lobbing at this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very odd\nYeah that was the uh that was the open a show last night now if there's any doubt in anyone's mind\nJust how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos where we should have calm where they want to ramble route\nAnd intimidate instead of a show results intimidation over ideas that's where it is I think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports\nIntimidation over information and insights they intimidate\nThis is all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views well they claim to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful\nThey say that\nYou're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege racist and you're they're obsessed with race we want people to be treated the same\nThe rule of law should treat all people the same\nDoesn't matter what color of your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't a five five forty Laura\nGlass half full I Believe that's coming up next a former assistant FBI or a staffer from New York has interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nFollowing is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management and I had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't have I ... I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and come back to drink\nThe follow up investigation be a public document what I'm going to be very interested in St Lawrence how long it takes a for that information to leak out of the skiff that's where they have to go to look at it and uh who's gonna who's gonna lab that it's going to be ridiculous but it will come out sooner or later during the\n... what a skiff is I Know what it is but my it\nWell basically the skip is is a room that's a soundproof or you can't hear you can hear in as you walk and then you can't carry in the cell phone ... watch or anything like that you can sit there and read it's totally a lead enclosed room so nothing penetrates it considering they're read the recent report\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and um and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out bottom line is\nHow many interviews do you have to do are as many it takes to delay this past the election watch\nThem right now it's like they're out of cards so the the current mayor coming down on this don't you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this this weekend\nI think that we should or should not be any more delays you do the best you can do in the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how\nMany more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to allegedly offer ... and only to the way of looking at a a vote\nI think this is a ... it's going to be voter run I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that they\nDo they know that if they haven't read and how do they know what's in the supplemental you know and they they don't know what questions are asked to who was interviewed\nThey might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the church has some beers with or who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up in order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it as by those that are opposed to the\n... we have an update here the bill bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that\nThe FBI prove ignored testimony from former classmates have Kevin ... these are people that went to Yale\nWith him and are they the the ... they're trying to Ronan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read into the story you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim\nSomebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo it would be FBI pro those people are they just seem to not credible witness\nThat probably not credible witnesses and bottom line first of all it's coming from Ronan or secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses after that they not permitted on the stand in a court of law never mind are doing this and it you have to make that\nCut off someplace into what is you know comment what does\nMake sense to do and none of these people make sense than anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody ...\nMm well again people think that the FBI is conducting some\nGlobal investigation into any allegation no matter how remote and interviewing people\nOn a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense Laura and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here uh the bureau's gonna get sucked in the eye one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out there that the the the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all Trump Trump fans from the bureau\nIf a if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the beer is going to take a black guy from the other side of that was\nI I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people have faith in our ...\nOur institutions of government especially like the FBI and you you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice\nWent on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witness\nAnd says to expect a field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of you know broad ranging ... brought us this kind of broad ranging slew thing\nInto the background of some and this is not what the what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what they're all the FBI is\nBut if you if you see the ignorance that it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous that shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you should lower bottom line is the some of these people truly don't believe um that there's anything going on it's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that does\nThat a judge Kavanaugh is guilty you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion but they do ...\nYou're on the ...

for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage\nAmong married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger a much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well\nUm this is this is a substantial block or the married\nCollege educated women and that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I\nI think a lot of this might be tone Trump's tone women like things calm they like things to be calm down and I think they they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks my change that I don't know [noise]\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women who've as you're right we point out\nTypically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area\nWhere the Republicans have really failed to drive their message clicked every day every day that the the national question is is she\nRapists or not\nThere's a day that nobody's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know in the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why and Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nLot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states and show again the races are hiding in the u._s._a.\nDonald Trump did see data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base up back home of course he didn't Joe plays exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case white male resentment\nWhite male resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men now to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far are not\nAs you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare and the density politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that the Democrats were completely energized\nThey were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized and I do think this thing\nHas awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately uh I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you're going to see a ton of a balance among turn out here\nBecause the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who\nYou know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so you know it's so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nBut see that's ironic thing that I\nCan see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races tightened up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted for the courts for Trump you know there's no question that it's gonna be a large\nPercentage more way above a majority that would want to see confirmatory in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job and didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message\nWe're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up ... maybe some people think we're leaving some people don't seem too harshly but as you said you stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I mean they don't have to run or less it's rather listen to and it's a Paul Ryan should've left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing it'd be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now\nA Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us it's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break a five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh this politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote for some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote are you going to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in this basic principle of fairness and would as mark said\nIf you really shy away from my identity politics and political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote get a get out there and vote and vote Republican don't go away\nA\n\nRepublican year will be a Democrat and

room to room where the buck up your computer often\nAsked me to join them in prayer to you know to pray for healing and in progress of this country and I have no doubt that's been part of this how you doing\nThanks for having me on a of Savage too relentlessly and shamelessly and morally and what's going on as a microcosm of the the ... will struggle we're in with the left today and it's why I Am so\nHappy that we have a a general in charge and Donald Trump because he fights back in all these purists he's never Trump purists who who think that he doesn't have the right manners they sit on the sidelines expect us to be passive and meanwhile the country is being taken from us by these relentless people on the left\nAnd and just the Democrats are just so shameless and they're almost a parody of themselves they said they want to the FBI investigation that was never about Kavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any originalist on there they want somebody who will preserve\nTheir judicial manufactured right to an abortion so that they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting they pre announce that they would reject him and it's despicable I'm sick of\nOur side are some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll put the nail the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the\nMost qualified and and and want one of those things is worried people find judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble rousing and chaos and meanwhile Trump\nIs slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is it Congress this fall but\nWe did read it NAFTA he's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through against not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than seven of all federal judges are Trump appointees uh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed\nThat means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past Trump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nAnd and some people say uh well the reason you guys what Trump is just because we ... no not just because of him is because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes\nAnd its regulations it's better trade deals and say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there to fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity and realize that we're in a in a in a serious battle\nTo preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is and where mccaskey and all the others are columns but I'm hoping with this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the audacity to vote against him at this point\nOr David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church and your new book a Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nUh you're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ... ...\n... and in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand how the early church was formed\nHow unlikely it was that these followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and devote their entire lives and and gave their lives or to this ah this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ or tell us about why this book was\nYou know it was so important for you to write at this point in your own life\nAh well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible because I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I had something some some books some guides and ... that would help me understand it better and be less intimidated so as I've studied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back\nAnd start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last book I wrote was about the gospels and move to paraphrase and and stay to most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book\nJesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church\nWhich follows the gospels and then six of Paul's Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed the planet and they were they were dissipating from the the true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of of adversity\nThe secular influences corn and it was a hotbed of\nSexual immorality and I'd olive tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix and sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back\nAnd we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today\nThey're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which is faith then Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to hew to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law\nAnd when and he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were a new competing religion\nBut that they were perverting the religion of God and and it was Judy as well as a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be them aside because they expected the Jews expected a military or political\nUh deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nAnd I didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was a hung on the tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory didn't even raise a hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't beat them aside and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up\nAnd in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the same ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him to from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists ...

up\nI'm On the health insurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago\nAnd they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOK I'm ... wood is in or your plans cover the Medicaid is not covering\nAll the boats and healthy thankfully I guess or um you know the thing we always come back to is unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may however\nMany services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know and a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance um it had covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had minimal minimal\nIncident afraid if they had some kind of a major event but he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know got scraping a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a stigma and we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a\nUm ... there's a bit of a stigma that oh I feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year\nThey're on a um [noise] there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and um you or you know in November we\nCan make a play on average you a free food

and we're so glad you're with us today Ramsey show Jackie's with us in Columbia South Carolina much Jackie how are you\nDon't find the thank you for taking my call sure what's up [noise] but I wanted to know if\nI co signed a loan for my son is six years ago twenty eight million on any of that and I'm sure that a part of my day to sit through a ... he got a little like he's supposed to ...\nWell when you sign alone and they don't pay you get to pay it that's why they one of the ... so how much do you owe on the student loan\nAlmost twenty thousand what's your household income\nOr about Seventy thousand\nSeventy okay in what is your son make\nAh he just got a job about twenty dollars an hour for making about twenty to twenty five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week yeah OK what you're doing with the rest of his time\nReality he he he\nDoesn't want to have a job that will conflict with this job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhat I Would have conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight 'cause he was on call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nTwenty hours a week maybe twenty five ... ... ... your TV they said and he he's just a good thing when they have a football game and the game the Fitch board at the game\nYou know what would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] you've been trying to get into the TV when you're\nOn the part where he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came to use the gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football fan so ... so he can pay freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that when I Do\nI'm going to come through and I and I do not have to go\nBecause he is the third in the late ... at least thirty days late every time you don't work much\nYeah yeah\nIt was a great place to go when you're broke to work so uh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial piece university and get his young budding gear and start writing the ... I I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you're single after his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what a fifty\nFifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills\nYeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mom I'm kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay you know and then you know you better plan on paying ... doesn't get moving\nOkay right so you're on your does you know ball and knock it out and then you chalk it up to that and\nBut dude I'm telling you a word will have some discussions is he married\nWho lived through the girlfriend\nOkay I'll bet she works forty hours yes there yeah\nThere you go [noise] alright open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nI'm Dave thank you [laughter] I don't think he's about my budget I Do the every dollar budget [laughter] come on baby steps to protect my expenses for the month [laughter] project what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something\nThese step to crank protect my expenses for them on [laughter] project what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down I had to had a tone and repaired and it cost almost five hundred dollar [laughter]\nIt was an ad and I often that we don't have ... do you have your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward get for that month so I get it wrong that will\nBe okay you cash flow to ... but if you can cash flow it that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month yeah\nGood and so you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap what this thing but usually you're not going to have that month than a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is\nUnexpected\nFor ... you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have\nAnything budgeted for car repair it\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on that car in a given six month period and um it might be tires it might be maintenance that might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regards\nSo probably going to add a little bit of a gun at the bailout safety or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up as a sinking fund they call it than the every dollar software or an aunt below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you\nUh have the money in cash than for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected emergencies should be unexpected things things that are often enough\nThat we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those\nAnd you can really build it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey appreciate you're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\n[laughter] I mean can you [laughter] I'm On earth laid we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\nThe question for you so my wife and I have about three hundred and and student did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile than you know line of credit that type of thing so it's not worth paying Kobe\nAnd we make a pretty good income she thought about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on\nMy question for you it I wasn't going back to school and get my masters the Koreans only twenty five okay to feel like that would be a very real our ally on it but over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on the\n... masters in what it would be ... ... ...\nAnd they would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be but it's hard to say I'm there would be when he came and raise 'cause the category of jump into mhm\nOkay are you doing in your bag and I would make it back in touch over\nA year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy expensive yeah\nI mean as you want to live in a really rough near ... yeah but you guys are really you're really spending Audi ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that mean you'd be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and\nOut of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare tell me about buying anything else you bought it\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk to me by buying anything else you bought enough crap for a while you need to and you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt cleaned up\nAnd then the process of doing that can have we've twenty grand or twenty five ran in the budget pressure\nMe that it's time to address this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree or am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a\nRegular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college there's a lot less expensive and you get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to ... the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is college\nCost\nIs the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd there and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a used pickup truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mom\nAnd answer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college\nSo you go to an in state school there in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando\nA wonderful ... near one but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive\nAnd uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need a mat\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nAfter school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and\nHe probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ... I'd be pretty cool not about part time job\nThe third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do but they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or read that somewhere they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that\nShe'll be NRA if you're going to live on campus or work in the cafeteria get free food you can live on campus if you can get a job working for the University of the tuition might be completely free that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at\nBut figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plant on working your butt off and those things will get you through school completely dead free in this day and time and it can be done\nAlex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAmos around the

some confusion you're dealing with in your career maybe you're scared you know exactly what you want to do what you just terrified well there's no shame in that we all face those fears and we've got

make the call we're here to help triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five will started off with Katie who's on the line in Ogden, Utah Katie how can we help\nI think are taking my call Cher I'm well I'm I'm feeling really confused about um life right now I'm a little background\nAbout five years ago I stopped going to school when my husband and I found out that pregnant and since then I've worked all kinds of our job to pay for him to finish and then he recently finished you got a great guy now and we're starting to kick our debt but they rounded how I'm such a difficult\nUm to help out I've been applying to places that I don't really want truck out just because you know we need that money and I don't have much else going on for me\nAnd I'm trying to think I've got two kids and Mike is the home um but I Know I Want to work and I want to help out and I and I feel like I locked myself and I have no idea where to even start to find my interests are my strength\nYeah well I understand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there's some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while\nAnd here's another reality reality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who were unemployed it is a fantastic job market even for stay at home moms meaning you want to stay home work from\n[noise]\n\nBlack America joining the conversation here all day Ramsey show I'm holding joined in Studio by Christie right we're Ramsey personalities word or there'll be this hour with your\nBusiness or your career that's what we are taking this hour come on come on Tripoli eight to five five two to five edge AAA eight to five five two to five and we're going to go to Patricia who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we all\nThink they're thinking like oh sure that's the only well\nHave been reading a book and you know London had um I'd love to open a yoga video that functions as a wellness center so off or not this Neal God but financial coping and other things to ... or physical mental and emotional health\nBut I was thinking about selling out and buying he'll play you know where I live up here and now this will be the wellness center like concern that that is that um will there be some sort of liability\nWell our ... go ahead\nNo you know like if someone was to get hurt a lot I Know I can apply for an L. O. thing and they go out the pilots who will soon that will go out to the business but I Lived in the same building with that there are I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue\nYou've got a couple of things going on here but you're going to want to own a a been a little bit how each of them first of all\nI'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws in your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're gonna have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liability is if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things do you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here that are traditionally encourage people to do because you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner so I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ...\nA little bit smaller and a little sooner so I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business\nSublease third base in off hours build your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront cost\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live above or your own seen them on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started\nOut of like elementary school elementary school right next to our household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do that so\nI don't think your idea is a bad idea I Would just challenge you to start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand and your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly\nSo he doesn't want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was the question I work full time and I think I'm going to Iran and I'm planning on also going back but minor to share and that way um I I've been making more money but it'll help them find like business as well\nYeah I well of course you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information plays beautifully knew what you're saying she's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you were trying to go right on open it\nRight um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when I see if you can get a small group to pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to lower to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and where you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside\nThey're coming and paying for you to don't feel like you have\nTo have a location before you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow Patrice ... out of your living room if you want to learn on the street and by the way you should [laughter] go ahead totally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio at the studios not the business you are the business\nPoint people don't care I Know they don't ... enjoy it they're coming for use or not accounting for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour taking your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we\nLook for us to get out and get a few good things are calling how can we'll all\nI've been on the chief field for about Twenty years and\nTo the point really hasn't been I haven't progressive farther clear as I originally hoped and wished I had\nA long story short Israel's I'm back in January was that I went through a pie view and as would have gone through a baby steps rounded up to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff together grabs they'll go on a became and to some old home movies have a fish from stuff that she had gotten from ... bad um when he had died um and\nAll the things we found you know we have a lot of all eight millimeters old VHS love stuff I'm like okay we have all this stuff\nUm I started converting it and I really found a passion for that that I have had in the future ... and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business doing going forward\nA foot isn't at this point\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business I'm converting\nLegacy format like Molitor VHS wide film law that ah the digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we bought a question I have is just um how\nTo get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm\nSo um how to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I throw it a properly and\nI'm more tell you what Bill question bill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we we help yeah here's the thing build the great news that\nAh when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses have similar type services what you then no is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find the people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them\nAnd you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language that speak to them right where they are the the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do is you're going to build your business and you're gonna do it better\nAnd you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself in that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helped we'll we'll send that to you ...\nIt's a great plans will follow it and and here's the thing of course there's a lot of bills out there he said some of it's interesting\nHe finds these little things and you realize way I don't have a lot about this and and you are giving him the steps the book is going to August ... but I wanted to say when they try it tested almost ... here's why\nSome passion should be ... it changes things when you turn it into a business it ain't that what you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it\nAnd keep paying him until others have you need is done me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting landing just do how in the water just do a triple eight eight to five five two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business\nDon't go anywhere\nCorrect the only self employed here\nOkay you want to know best path to get their correct crocus I'm going to say one quick thing let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back to just you know what I mean you got to hang on and you can do it here we are October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and in Christ is going to were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie the contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company was paying your salary\nSo they're different companies okay two ... two of them are kind of actually my own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is through a company I used to work four years ago that you contract court for\nPerfect I mean they don't pay that salary yeah\nThe reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of backed me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken said\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interests\nOf other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person you're building it up and of course it will be crazy first season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your full time job it's the next logical step where the business can support you the income is there of course that's only going to help and your husband has income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing\nReady I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path and doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have a fulltime job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out you're already doing if you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up\nThat will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first dear you probably should be able to comfortably leisure leader named them\nYeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days maybe step stays babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside and to Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience and lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels an important point can cause so many people still like how can sustain this well you're not until January when you ... you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season and then had the rewards and it's worth it things are\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\nHey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field at six years I've been doing a security

I I got to take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a paid any attention and this is the second time about two and a half years ago\nAnd in the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay you know you know what is your fault you know yeah um\nAnd it's her fault or

this toy I Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way\nSo yeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect\nSo you know you don't need another car you don't need another but you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the boat actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right [noise]\nUh for the grandkids and for the kids to play on and so you know I I get ready to buy toys and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our but I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to sharing about this\nShe gets ready to buy a person's too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys is too expensive but like she says one of those purses is equal to one\nOf those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know and it's funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not theirs and one of the seven habits as talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship\nAnd they are intimidated by you to the spouse is an arrogant rebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body\nAnd goes and buys whatever they want to buy\nBut no that is wrong so they hide it from you know most often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call one of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well\nEnds up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty condemnation based hiding\nSo they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband you shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved and I want to be again can carry that ministry of weight\nOnce all the decisions are made\nBut every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who has almost been on Oprah more than anybody Oprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty\nMinutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air\nAnd Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows you know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them\nIn their trouble on Oprah and the very first family of course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into\nOn Oprah and the very first family of course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into\nA sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah why would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nIs what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea [noise]\nAnd uh I had told the producers as it was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof fees freaking clueless when his relationship and so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially fault and he owes earn apology\nI don't think I agree with that and that is it well you would be wrong\nHe does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand or with a bat and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof and she's like well he delegated to her and said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you'd never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture he said and now you are one\nAnd these two are not one they're not on the same page and so you know the poor lady sitting there crying because she so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding that he got a grand and debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and\nUm you know and I'm a I'm standing around making him apologized to her for not being a good husband because of your wife can run up your husband can run a hundred thousand dollars in debt you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\n[noise] one of the two but most of the time but you just did you just dumping on it and then and then you\nCry because they didn't do it right after you'd dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes and what we'll do the ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care\nEnough to get involved and know what was going on and so\nOprah's all upset with Dave goes Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out what all the rest of the show but we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage had been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years sit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name\nBefore the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month of begins a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWhere you see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation tenfold increase their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nTenfold they began to agree on their goals and their productivity what their money goes through the roof you feel like you've got a raise when you've learned through this together\nOn paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software every dollar the best for your phone every dollar of every dollar a name\nUm you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really\nThat was really huge um you know just getting on the same page and also not being afraid of hard work um you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one\nAnd you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors than we were able to pay off with a much quicker a lot quicker than we thought because\nLike we didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming and then just losing it all the student loans we thought how are you gonna pay this off are we going to get at home do all these different things started family but um you know definitely goal was on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in a pretty good time\nYou know how how do you explain to other people because I Know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity that is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game all\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was um mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us then and we just had made the decision and my heart that um\nWe weren't going to do that and so I had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was normal you know it was just a\nMeaty offer the and that was just a part of life\nThan Sallie Mae is going to be a room mate for life\nRight by God though people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit this into your life that we had just made a decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live within\nAn fail and we weren't really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do those zero budget you know there's your eggs and budget everything out every dollar hadn't assignment\nAnd every extra dollar went to my student loans though we were making payment like in the grand they're making payments to having dogs and a month right we have to have a big shovel and then we put everything we had toward the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping on socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to live to two years like and that lifestyle you know\nBut um I Would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to pray through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle\nAnd really be uplifted in the spirit um had a really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and on and he had countless hours worked ... hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay prepared\nAnd prior to really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those pains of it was it worth it yeah I don't\nKnow you're completely free yet good yeah I Know what\nElse should get out of this it's like when you climb a wall that's that tall you kind of come away going we can free can do anything\n[laughter] [noise] yeah I mean\nThey're grocery strengthens me but I mean we can do anything I was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns of wine is your thumb you went out killed it drug it home and paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars a day or so impressive\n[laughter] sounded pretty cool we got a copy of Chris ... book for your returns fired we want that to be the next chapter in your story and it definitely will be outrageously generous\nAnd of course millionaires along the way so you're right on track to do all of that I'm so proud of you guys I Know your family's in I don't know your passers proud of you\nYou make sure you tell Robert ... story [laughter] I don't want to hear this yeah and\nI don't know what he wants to hear this I'm telling you love it our guys way to go All right it's true

well done either some of every generation to decide to be losers not those two ... and not the ones I get from age and you know that's an interesting thing you know what they did they just decided

false witness against our neighbor which of course was banned by the\nJewish people in the Old Testament banned in the Christian Bible but it's not banned by Charles Schumer and Dianne Feinstein in fact the entire Democratic Party seems to be run on a the tenant that you know by all means necessary that's a tenet of communism\nPulling WABC is calling he claims to be a Muslim are you really a Muslim people\nOh no but I just I'm sort of on the corner and I just five ... five ... find out what they say and the\nWater's liquor runs say about bearing false witness against neighbor\nThat it's very simple if your neighbor is aimed for you though you're blessed by God of the study\nAnd so you mean if if you're not a non Muslim you can lie about them with with impunity\nThan if you are and ... and ...\nI got it now if you're a Muslim and you make up false charges against an enemy who is not a Muslim that's okay\nThat's fine if you're blessed by\nNow but what does it say let's let's stick to the other point one if a Muslim the famous another Muslim with false testimony watch the crime\nPunishment put it this way is that ... or the ... it's a woman who was being raped for instance you need for men are Muslims are mean and on how to fight them have fate or in order to have a case of the way that ... to ...\nYou know I Know the woman as a second class citizen in most traditional Muslim societies there's no question about it but what does the Koran say about bearing false witnesses what I'm trying to figure out\nWhat it is not bad though it's not good if if they do it again and other mosques\nYeah so but what does the punishment [noise] we don't know whether what do you have to drive in Nineteen sixty five Volkswagen or the rest of your life but I don't like what are well we'll have to look it up a self I\nCan verify that uh we got great cause I'm not I'm not groping there's no grope\nThere's no grow up I think I Need to lighten it up and that we played Obama from a one way he says I was a thug I did illegal drugs I drank drank six packs before going to school and somehow that didn't stop him from becoming a president\nWhile I've been waiting to do this I have I've just taken the salts to avoid the same thing here is my favorite gal Dianne Feinstein today on the FBI report listen they're complaining she didn't get a chance to read and listen to her oh two\nCanned is late when we review today and I'm In the very limited time [noise] um I was there I had to leave off I ... is the heart and I had the opportunity to read some but not all of it\nIt looks to be a prime of an incomplete investigation well on our women and you didn't\nHave time to read it but you know it's incomplete or the report is incomplete and you didn't read it though so here she is against first she destroys demand publicly now she acts like clean old Diane and uh it's it's an incomplete report and although the Democrats agree that the invest\nPublicly now she acts like clean old Diane and uh it's it's an incomplete report\nAnd although the Democrats agree that the investigation should be limited they didn't say it should be limited actually they should that should be limited but not really limited and the way you know so now they're saying the reports incomplete and it's not a legitimate report listen to the next one in the next clip notes\nRam it crashed agreed that the investigations so should be limited did not agree that the White House should tie the in the eyes of only not afraid\nOf all of a that public testimony in last hearing is a substitute for interviews by FBI agent ... sack of\nDirty clothing you cabin or has been subject to the three FBI investigations\nAlong the road to becoming a federal judge [noise] how many investigations have applied to Dianne Feinstein or Charles Schumer [noise] for\nThe alleged ties between another senator and radical Islam how many FBI investigations counts them zero [noise] so yes America has made up its mind they definitely have seen the enemy\nJoy love Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred and Seventy five for over seven to eight to ...

just demand never forget that\nSo he made a mistake and picking Kavanaugh amongst the twenty five so that becomes the next question for the political thriller called the Savage Nation\nWho is it in

will know about it [noise] grandpa went to the oval office there's a picture of him and the president that's great stuff\nWhether you like it or not it doesn't matter it's a big deal to sit at that desk that great resolution desk from the great resolution warship you didn't sit there or you mock us in Santa Rosa or you've failed lawyers and retired doctors you're drug addicts you you would never

office she was the last one in there before I met the president\nShe flew right by me like a like a dark thing flew by\nMike almost made us squawking sound as as she flew by my question is did she push it she and her people along with the federalist society the neo cons in order to set trumped up for a fall I don't know who did this this is not even a cabin or gets in\nThis horrible horrible horrible experience for America is something we could've avoided had have chosen amongst the twenty five choices the woman judge who was equally if not more\nA powerful experience for America is

take the job anyway I don't want to live in Washington the thought of wearing a suit every day is enough to stop me from doing anything\nThe thought of taking off my sandals and wearing shoes prevents me from taking a regular gig anywhere on earth and the guy said to me I Want you to be the head of the NHL turned him down\nThe thought of it can you imagine living in Washington DC let's say I buy a

goes to work at a regular office outfits outfits you cannot wear the same suit every day can you show figure five days away you got to have five different suits\nFigure two grand the suit not a big deal OK you could afford but the idea of the Martin icing and then the chemical smell on the rotation then you've got the shirt that that cuts the neck\nThe tie this I hate socks\nI'm thinking about that I I hate socks teddy knows this more than anyone on our my dog he sees me struggling with the sock issue almost every time I go out and put shoes on I hate socks even thinking about this like Barry a little in the future let's say a hundred years now I don't want socks on\nThem and then the more they're going to go and it was down there what do you mean socks for anywhere I mean I just

this man's life\nWhy are there no penalties for lying under oath which she lied recurrence ... at least\nWe're also going to talk about why life being destroyed at a hyper right across the planet and ask ourselves as some say are we heading to the sixth mass extinction on this planet I Know it's something that the great conservatives don't want to think about\nBecause by and large the conservatives in the radio business are as old fish on this issue\nAs the Democrats are on Donald Trump\nBecause by and large the conservatives in the radio business are as old fish on this issue as the Democrats are on Donald Trump\nBut wildlife destruction is something that should concern all of us and conservatives mean conserve we should conserve our friends on the planet not destroy them very big story but let me begin with the mass hysteria\nOf our time one paragraph if I could indulge myself or your listenership for one second\nListen to what happened in sixteen forty to\nPerhaps the record holder for such criminality was one Thomas Granger\nWho is set to have had relations with the mayor of cow to go to shape to capture the turkey overwhelmed by the sheer number in diversity of Granger allegedly ... the offended public raised no objections and he was executed that was during the Salem witch trials in the chapter from Plymouth Rock\nTo city hall and stop mass hysteria in other words\nWhen we talked about the Salem witch trials on this program yesterday\nAnd I'm showing you the witch trials of today the witch trial of Trump\nThe witch trial of deplorable ... the witch trial of cabin on as an example of a ... as a fact told him of all of us it's really nothing new this happened in New England in the sixteen forty era and tragically it's happening again\nAnd it's an example of the hysteria that is driving the political narrative today the hysteria that began on college campuses by a group of radical psychotic feminists\nKilling the patriarchy has now a poison the entire body politic\nSo I'm going to ask you again who in your opinion benefited most from the capital persecution\nNow many of you would think it's going to be a knee jerk reaction for me and said Republicans did\nBecause the base has been agitated by this I'm not so sure as a matter of fact\nI Know two very successful conservative women who always been conservative not recently they didn't just recently voted for Trump they'd be conservative since they young youngsters and they're not happy with Kavanaugh would you believe that I was actually shocked to learn that\nThey don't like them they think he was angry I said what\nWhat do you mean he was in other words they bought the line from the Feinstein gang that after they rip dismantle shreds and unfairly accused with things they didn't do the man stood up for himself they said he he looked angry to look right I couldn't believe that [noise] so uh let's not to be so sure it's going to work for us [noise]\nSo [noise] do\nYou get here I'm In my studio here in San Francisco and there was a roar outside that's because the blue angels I'd be gone there they're practicing their warm ups what else appeared in Germany during that into war period homosexual lesbian bar suddenly popped up and German cities I Know I'm not supposed to make a point of it but they did\nBut mainly in Berlin number the sprays how you're going to keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Berlin\nWell look at all the green haired girls at UC Berkeley er at Columbia they all basically farm farm girls would come to the big city and suddenly they're wild and free most Germans were shocked by this\nBut then the leaders were not\nIn the past Germany had glorified mother and father at a glorified mothers' duty to the father land but said why my years glorified ramping sexuality free expression hedonism\nThe accent of women and so the liberal why more government was so akin to what we're having in America today the people felt good about it prostitution was the criminalized drugs what ramping laws\nAgainst venereal disease were dropped\nJust as an America would dropping laws against using heroin now\nFirst they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this what else happened in the ... republic that is akin to what's happening in America today weekend police authority rapid lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing\nCriminals subtly proliferated what else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms what else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking\nFirearms what else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about\nThe backlash to this liberalism arose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany and uh you have groups like on the ... the ...\nCowards are put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying Sam glorifying the brown stretch I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember when I said many times\nThose do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing what do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world of where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the ... today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the analysis of today and Don by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there so the communist weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking that Republicans now senators no one stops them it's as though we're powerless to protect ourselves from these Vermont so the Germans said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that we're still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units coal brown shirts and they started beating of communist in the streets\nThat's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you're gonna be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story biggest as this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happen next what worries me next\nThe brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nHe had to do that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shirts and some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nOr what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up\nAn opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing that year when I said and so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong cost the left with like you to think he said lose the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass those liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this\nBut they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point that my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut its solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left would say any of us illusions of extreme ... said the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a is a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much of what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what uh Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat he's doing he drank by the shepherd's drank too much ... what what are you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy I went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an aberration\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming\nThat's certainly an aberration what I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left than it's super liberalism\nIs a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about\nTrust me on that see this is what triggers at all if we have an economic blowout in in the west\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen that you can't believe are happening and what happens so fast you say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here\nAnd the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\n... economists is a is inevitable it's going to happen and I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're the heightened now of the stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history they're just printing money\nAnd under the Democrats when we criticize deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dummy up they shut their mouths you put on you or anyone in the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the ... and just before all of this that and take a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how valueless the money I become\nNow several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company has not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of\nHillary Clinton's book what happened yes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America as some of them posted by enemies of Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there are cycles too at kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I ride on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the

by Dr Ford or the second accuser this Deborah Ramirez\nThere's nothing absolutely zero you know when you have one of the big guys CNN political commentators is David ...\nWhen you hear him say that the ball game is over meaning that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed I you know that's a that's pretty damn significant because of the way that flake\nAnd Collins are signify if they're going to vote that they are yes notes however I I'm I'm not saying that this is a hundred percent over because we are thrown curve balls I mean you get a look when we aren't look how we've gotten here I nothing is certain anymore nothing absolutely zero but it is watching like Kavanaugh's\nHeaded toward a confirmation or even though he has been just unfairly maligned and stay tuned and destroyed and his family\nHis kids is white I mean it's really just\nGrotesque and essentially the Democrats they have resulted essentially to argue a about the process right so\nYou know Democrats are left with nothing else to argue except about the process and when you're down to making arguments about process well kind of means you're losing and you're losing bad so as far as I left the coach here\nAnd again I don't think he'd give a hundred percent count than anything but this is the way it certainly is looking that Collins inflate you're going to us because Collins' Susan Collins from Maine said quote it appears to be a very thorough investigation\nBut I'm going back later today to personally read the interviews that's really all I have to say right now but it appears to be a very thorough investigation is what Collins and of course colleges rely on a lot of our staffers and and you know her other colleagues et cetera flake Jeff Flake said we asked\nThe FBI to investigate current credible allegations that's what they've done I plan to vote for him before but I certainly wants to the FBI the professionals to look at it and they have\nAnd I think they've been sorrow\n\nA so oh you mean you don't need the Democrats you don't meet Joe Manchin don't need a Heidi Heitkamp Heidi Heitkamp told a TV station in Fargo North Dakota earlier today that she's an oval so mention is still on the site\n[noise] uh\nSo if you get Collins and you get fully\nThen it's a done deal\nOr you don't even need Murkowski by the way Murkowski this just out in the last that thirty minutes or so from the Anchorage daily news\nAnd they write the Murkowski told reporters that she did not yet know whether the FBI had been thorough enough that its investigation or spoken to enough witnesses asked whether she felt that she had been given enough time to consider the decision before voting this weekend Murkowski added\nI certainly hope so yes so that's where we're getting now from brick houses but they don't need Murkowski flights Collins eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine more Schmidt and your calls coming up [noise]\n[noise]\nDid you ever look at the stains and your

'cause my my phone screen or dropped off a thank you guys I appreciate it one other observation this is what's really sick and said here\nThere are protests going on right now as we speak there are protests that are occurring\nAre at the U.S Capitol inside the Senate office building so I'm looking now at Capitol Hill police they are a arresting some protesters right\nNow they're using the the plastic a zip tie handcuffs I see a guy in a in a safari have to ...\nAn awful ugly green plants are being taken away a\n... now so women are sitting down\nA obviously they're being asked to move and they're not so they are resisting so now we have another Capitol Hill police officer applying zip ties to a female protester now\nOr who's being hauled away so arrests are being made inside the Senate office building ... and this is what the Serbs me is you know they're they're screaming you know rape is you know never again\nAh there was also a whole busload of protesters that got on a bus in Chelsea in Manhattan\nOr earlier this morning they got on a bus to them drive down to DC to join these protests and I heard a soundbite from an individual that was saying that I was sexually assaulted a I was raped\nAnd a cabin on is guilty and I\nYou know this can happen it's just it disturbing beyond belief that there is no prove there's no corroboration here and then all of these individuals I think that Brett Kavanaugh is a sexual assault or a a a\nDeviant a rapist and it's just colossally unfair it's just not\nRight with no proof\nAnd again you've heard that in this particular case Kavanaugh is guilty until proven innocent\nAnd I'm Sorry that's not the way things work here in the United states and it's just a shame and even if Kavanaugh is confirmed and it's starting to look that way ah there's gonna be a stain from these individuals and there's always going to be this paint it a lot of the Clarence Thomas issue with Anita Hill and the coconut pubic hair deal and yeah and\nThat loom for a while that seems to have a faded you know will this fate or is there are always going to be this cloud of those that are pointing fingers in calling him the rapist on the Supreme Court\nThat is just grossly grossly unfair that this individual even though there's no corroboration of Dr Ford story her memory is fuzzy on so many levels\n\nSo many people have just automatically convicted Brett capital it's just unfair Arlen sit in your phone calls thanks for the uh for the patients and waiting if you want to get in\nWe'll just automatically convicted Brett Kavanaugh it's

W don't sound like a man to me\nWell you're in a million that doesn't think so and anyway I just had to comment on them because I don't even I mean it is I I don't think it was an act at all with her\nOh my God you're you're certainly you're entitled to her opinion now do you think that she's telling the truth the do you believe that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Dr Ford back when she was Fifteen Years old\nMaybe if he if he was a drink or any blackout he might not even remember it you just don't know and I don't think that the FBI investigation I think it was a brand by the White House and the person running the White House is Donald Trump\nAnd so you know it's on on on some enough I'm summarizing than I Am I saying that you're a you're a Hillary supporter right you you didn't vote for Trump right now oh no no no well you know why ... won't clear what you're saying is\nIt's tantamount to when I Would expect to us and that means that you're saying and I I appreciate your phone and let's roll to custom in Missouri yellow Clifton Iran Schmidt welcome\nOh billions plan by the Democrats they want to take over the country and make it a\nCommunist state it all started back good I'm not a good a good run and then to go through all these years [noise]\nAnd then we don't have any jobs and they had these people to stick to me will keep the food stamps coming is the Democrats who I Know they're paying people to attack our Republican senators\nAnd I'll tell you want them ... wants terrorist cells to because we can do on them like they turned on us or not thrown by the by God they're going to get a bunch of gold because the crooked\nAnd so my question is what what's coming to them or are you making a threat against Democrats\nKnow comics [noise] at AT T ball late enough like they're born baked bread bowl which attacked we're the thunder D.C shot there too and the recovery the undergraduate kill the public [noise] ... came out what's going on at\nOnce and obviously you know with with the Rand Paul and that that's not a neighbor attacking him on the the lawnmower or you know I I don't I don't know if that\nIs essentially a in did you live of the battles that are occurring between Democrats and Republicans these days I think that was the Rand Paul case was just a nut bag neighbor who's had trouble for a while now as far as Steve skull east uh and Republican\nHe's I think that was the Rand Paul case was just a nut bag neighbor who's had trouble for a while now as far as Steve ... a and Republicans being targeted at that that baseball practice I mean clearly they were a target Republicans weren't target and I don't discount that at all I take that very seriously\nIn Westport pets need you and maybe you need them\nYour love and generosity heal the wounds of our furry friend inside and out but if you made that Oregon said pets live\nYou know the prescription pain relievers have contributed more overdose deaths than cocaine and heroin combined talk with your kids about the dangers of medicine is a drug free die for them to learn more a message from the partnership for drug free kittens\n[noise] us forward ... cars so Laurie engines show talk and I can't [noise]\nDo you see our sci am a WBRC F.

take you to court even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nI don't know if ... is ever going to get to a yes her native Alaskan and Native American constituents are not fans of Kavanaugh\nAnd many have been vocal about it you know the rates of of sexual violence against women are higher in Alaska than any other state in the country most of the victims are Native American\nAnd Alaska Native women nearly half experienced sexual violence a nearly one third experience rape or attempted rape and\nThat's much much higher than the national average is so that's one problem now those issues exist but it is unfair and here here's here's an asterisk here's the caviar it is unfair\nTo apply this smeared job to Kavanaugh to the plight of women\nIn Alaska that are facing these problems so it is just grossly negligent it's just unfair to just glom onto this democratic smear campaign to absolutely\nShred the name of Kavanaugh and to apply it to the horrific crime of sexual assault and rape and just it's completely unfair so I Want them to lay out that yeah there is an issue and you of native Alaskans a Native Americans in Alaska they are are\nThey are in effect a group of people there's no doubt about it but it is grossly unfair to then take that plight and to Velcro at the cabinet and it's grossly\nUnfair here\nAnd ah but by the way you know even ... and this is important I I got a point that's a good the bad and the ugly\nOr even before or some of these ah\nSexual assault issues came up and the doctor for allegations and again just allegations nothing's been corroborated\nAgain you know we have you know folks that have changed stories here we've got you know the best friend the Ford had no recollection of this or or Brent Kavanaugh I mean it's incredible that sweating it gets back track with her crazy story\nBut even before any\nSexual of issues and Alaskans applying their plight to Kavanaugh before that Alaskans did not like Kavanaugh\nBecause they didn't ... not all but a lot of the native Alaskans are they didn't like Kavanaugh because he was involved in a case that they saw as a threat to native sovereignty and\nThey don't want him ruling on sturgeon the frost the case this for him to the Supreme Court is going to hear on November ... that could have a huge impact on the Alaskan fishing industry\nSo people forget this because McCain thumb\nThe number of fear that could have a huge impact on the Alaskan fishing industry\nSo people forget this because McCain thumbs\nA you know went down and and McCain's thumbs got all the attention last year but remember Lisa Murkowski also book her party she voted against that GOP health care bill as well\nSo you know Murkowski is not afraid to go it alone but a lot of folks might not know about that that the sturgeon a vis a vis a surgeon V. frost case and the sovereignty issue so\nAh you know there there is a concern there as well uh back to the phones so where do you want me to go were loaded up here where ... where do you want me to do what okay let's sort of New Jersey so from Alaska all the way the toms river New Jersey and can roll Iran Schmidt Hi Carol\nHi how are you um I don't understand these women protesters who are saying that this is a women's women's issue and I'm I'm all of that crap we did hear her we didn't listen to her and the worst possible way\nThis could have been done find her her problem is with Feinstein Feinstein had this information and she waited until the vote and then she came forward and said oh we have this thing that we have to discuss a Dr Ford should\nBe around because Carole that was a devious escort selfish nasty plan to ambush and totally bullets Kavanaugh in the last moments

made sure it at some point where she could have reported it\nAgain you know the relationship with the gentleman that David her for six years and claims that she never brought up any sexual assault\nOr that she allegedly coached a friend on how to pass a polygraph exam she was trying to get a gig with the D.

Jones for instance and\nYou know we we\nWe can I can go down the list I don't have enough time but I can I can go down the list of the individuals the claim that the Clinton assaulted them ... where are these marchers complaining about Bill Clinton where all the also I I'm trying to figure out I think it might have been CBS but ... this is my last day and I had\nThis item yesterday uh I think it was yesterday will maybe was early this morning I I Can't remember ... I go through so much stuff but ... the Clinton I Believe she was interviewed a by CBS and they were talking to her about you know capital and\nThe sexual assault the accusations and doctor for and it never came up about her father I mean how can you bring that up with Chelsea Clinton and all the accusers' then President Clinton and finished\n... yeah I mean I think all of this Thursday through I think that it's clearly politically motivated um and I think that it's an insult to Americans in general that Democrats think that they can ... for all these things and we're just going to believe that hook line and sinker I think it's just and both are generally as Americans", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "04"}
