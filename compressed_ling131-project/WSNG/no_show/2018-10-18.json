drinkers you a really good series about global warming and climate change because it's going to affect your beer now yeah experts now say that extreme weather brought on by changing climate could put beer on the endangered species list\nPlease ... some of the ah the beer experts are saying give me a break as a new study predicting a global beer shortage because of a global warming\nAnd the growth of hops and and and barley and it's [noise] you know you can be a really so now that is that the new tactic to try to bring beer a lovers into the fold to try to a full meant that the global warming climate change deal\nSo and then there's a push back they gotta buy a bunch of the brewers apparently are now saying\nAh that that this has blown out of proportion\nAnd at the annual barley yields could fall free the Seventeen percent\nJust like Al Gore said we were at the point of no return\nA while I was at and where our cities are going to be flooded up to like the second third floor and I was going to be one back in like what two thousand two thousand to whatever the the out years ago and then of course we have that new scare that came out uh about two weeks ago that we have Thirteen Years now\nTwenty thirty one or whatever the change course or is there a reversible in all the Chicken Little sky is falling listen I Want I Want clean water I Want clean air\nThe change course or is there reversible in all the Chicken Little sky is falling less I Want I Want clean water I Want clean air I mean I I'm a scuba diver I Want clean oceans\nBut again here's the latest round of a portion of a life controlling and throw projects that global warming scare tactics\nAnd the rest of the like clockwork it's cyclical [noise] eight hundred and ... both things the the these these these news stories and these new attempts to scare everyone is cyclical as well it's fairly constant but it does come in cycles and then\nYou know the planet the heating of the planet cooling has been cyclical or for for millions of years for billions of years the plan it's been hot and the planets been colder\nCenturies prior to the industrial revolution the planet was warmer than a cold I you know I don't want flipping ramp and pollution I Want to again we we ought to put the least the missions possible into the atmosphere but again I\nYou know there's the same tactic just it's ... it's like rings and repeat it's like a shampoo bottle instruction a first ladies okay there was a a incident on the first lady's jet\nSmoke filled the cabin earlier today millennia Trump was on the way to Philadelphia from a joint base Andrews she was on board a\nCentrally an air force to type plane or pump pail type plane she was on board one of the seven five seven's\nA and there's a a military designation I think it's the sea thirty two\nHey so can you look up to see thirty make sure I have that right and see if the sea thirty two is the bowling seven five seven in the military designation anyone that's the the plane she was on the the seven five seven equivalent and she was headed from joint base Andrews the Philly\nAnd the plane turns around because smoke filled the cockpit the plane with us who says I'm going to see thirty to the plane was about ten minutes into flight Secret Service agents suddenly jumped up and they are darted toward the cockpit\nAnd the reports from the media on board is that smoke\nIn the cockpit was filtering a you\nKnow through the airplane and then uh that's what the media has reported there were wet towels given out to the press corps and the other passengers on the plane so their faces could be covered\nBecause of a ... a strong burning older burning smell no reports of injuries the plane landed safely uh about nine to five eastern time this morning and the first lady Melania Trump she's on her way to Philly a foreign event\nTo visit the Thomas Jefferson hospital for a conference on neonatal abstinence syndrome\nAnd that apparently according to a re come news is a win babies have withdrawal symptoms because of their mother's drug use are particularly narcotics\nSo I'm Glad to hear that everyone aboard the first lady's flight is okay or some type of mechanical malfunctions some type of burning and smoke in the cockpit at a\nHappens on commercial flights you know luckily not that often but it happened that everyone's just fine and a couple of other things here on the ah on the mall or front\nIs the Mona pro ... wrapping up indications are it's getting pretty close there was a report out today in Bloomberg\nThat special counsel Robert Mueller could be getting very close to wrapping up the Russia investigation\nAnd it could actually result in his report being sent to the department of justice\nBy this time next month\nAnd again the indication that we're getting close is when you start hearing about\nThe interviews or their request for interviews for individuals at the highest level of the chain for instance the stories that have come out that the the uh Mahler team is trying to work out the questions that\nThe Trump will answer and of course that the top you get an interview\nPresident Trump last\nGoing to be last in the chain because that's how they put their investigation again so the implication is that we're getting close to the end and it could actually be by mid November So after the midterm elections things have been very quiet because\nAs is typical of those type of event it go radio silence and that's what happens if you have the the ... they've really been in radio silent mode since the end\nThat event it go radio silence and that's what happens if you have the the modern ... they've really been in radio silent mode since the end of August first of September and\nThat's that sixty day window prior to an electric in this case the midterms and they didn't want to interfere which I think is the right thing to do now\nOr the report from Bloomberg says the deputy attorney general and the guy in charge of the modern investigation Rod Rosenstein\nAnd new Trump best money or wants to get this thing done which makes perfect sense a after them in terms of the fate of a whole lot of folks including Rosenstein Jeff Sessions or couldn't be ... by a threat I Would imagine sessions has gone after the midterms according to the Bloomberg report\n[noise] the mall or reports will focus exclusively on his findings or\nLack there of concern in collusion and or obstruction now as been the case here\nAs a as it's been known for quite some time hundreds from both sides are Republican Democrat as well as most legal experts feel that obstruction poses a much greater threat to President Trump\nAnd the inner circle than any collusion or conspiracy but all this remains to be

she did it\nIt's one thing to take the test I'm I'm Glad you took the test that's cool\nAnd I'm Glad she's proud that there is some of that blood in there but to to try to use it as a slam dunk against Trump ... was in it was stupid and she looked silly and when you look silly once that gets into the the cultural divide\nYou're in trouble like Cory Cory bookers Spartacus that you're in trouble you know you're you're already and eat anything you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on to the ivy league saying really did\nShe really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and there she could've done released the details in a way to put ... you know help put away the issue and she didn't do it in person not smart enough to do that as a smart enough to be president\nWell the other thing is is out at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's known them since twenty twelve when it was questioned then she came up with inadequate\nA proof of it and I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see uh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the boss and I know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do\nYou should go out and said this has been an issue since twenty twelve it was brought up in that election campaign and I've now don't a test I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American so you know what I was wrong and if she had done that\nAnd and used it as soon as she still would have been able to say to the public I'm I'm maybe as much as three percent Native American but I was wrong to claim that a Native American status I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason to advance or sell financially and professionally but she can do that\nI think America would have said oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nWell here you go and she had the ... and she has the perfect um hook is he the ancestry dot coms there's ancestry dot com commercial where some guys say for all my life we thought we were German we went to the you know October fest we dressed up and then we found that were Seventy percent Irish [laughter]\nThere's whatever it was only ... I've seen a commercial out there that that deals with this she does a spoof of that commercial or would I mean that's the way out there a little bit but still the I\nWill not hide it well no you're on the ... you're on the right track out imagine\nIf she'd said hey you know that ancestry commercial is the guy who thought he was Irish and they found is these are tallying instead well guess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed\nThey would have said well OK and we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it but so few of the I Want your view on this so few politicians seem capable of saying\nYou know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and a no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they say hey she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that wouldn't go\nYeah her her ... you're exactly right hurt her tax\nWould have been to like under play said under play what ... under play the relationship and they said a mate you\nAdmit she made them in ... she made a mistake and people would move on it because and again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and [noise] she she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the names out there and that they're going to be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God you how boy ... when you say that the picture comes back to mind but the other thing or two years later thirty or is he still knows he looks like a feel for and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospects but here's the other thing that bugs me about it out and you tell me what you think we hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions\nAnd we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death\nSending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out so when we hire people to make really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossal leap bad this she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data and\nAnd rather than saying you know I'd probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it she makes a colossally bad\nMistake and then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nYeah what what's interesting is as you're talking I'm remembering what of I guess is chief of staff Kelly said about a couple of weeks ago how he he was arrogant and of course she took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah it does it does you know that's a general\nAbout a couple of weeks ago how he he was arrogant of course she took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah it does it does you know that's a general generals used to that you know tough people you know it's a color arrogant and say that that's the key to this this thing\nIt's the arrogance of thinking well about the the media behind me I'm going to do this and I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to key why she thought this would be a good idea and in doing it again it the way she did\nThere's all there's also I think comedy isn't or ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if if Cory Booker wanted to beat Spartacus he needed to arrange for somebody else to call them ... because when you call yourselves part it goes doesn't quite work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's the thing they're all all these people are trying all these Democrats\nWho are thinking about two dozen twenty are all trying to ... not just the way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump see I got him I got well you don't like the ball and you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing you know one sixty fourth Indian is like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball he look stupid\nYou know but but that study that twenty twenty or so focused on that\nYou're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me that that goes back to the presidency\nNow do you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean that would be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or does this clear the path for for Joe Biden let's say\nIt it makes things easier for the people who are running against or but again with the ... uh news cycle that so fast me Kanye West of the White House already seemed like years ago\nAnd there you go you know so it made you know again but it weakens her and again she's going to be fighting some people who who who want really want the job too and they're not going to play nice so\nShe can maybe you maybe you can but again once you once you're in that once you're in that place where you're seeing is not serious which is what one thing she had going for is that she was seen as a serious thinker and now you look silly you've taken away\nYou know some of your say mo Jo some of the thing that made you Elizabeth Warren and\nHow you that's hard to hard to recover from\nYou know al I got a rap during the second but I had one other thought you know who I feel sorry for and this is Democrats who are also Native Americans real Native Americans because it puts them in an incredibly awkward spot do I stay loyal to my ... my a party and because I Believe in the Democratic party I Know there are people who do\nDidn't mention it to your screener because you're just talking about the publicity that one in um in terms of Elizabeth Laurie I'm\nJust that\nIt's\nRight in his ... continue to make a very big deal about it I just I in my mind keeps going that burst there um oh\nThe birther thing well you know are we still haven't said\nGet out for years on the ... ate it yet Obama let alone you us that that was awful it was\nMay join in what I Do know that some of us still have serious questions about President Obama's um background we still don't know much about what he took her how he got into his undergrad his graduate\nSchool or into Harvard there are many people who went to Harvard the same time he did including friends of mine when Elon routes one of them\nWho says I was there on campus I never saw the guy so and we don't know anything about him we knew when Gore ran against Bush\nOr for the presidency we knew what Gore's grades were and we knew what he took we knew what Bush's grades where we knew Bush got a better grade in science and Al Gore did we didn't we don't know anything about him\nHe was the editor of the Harvard law review but he never wrote an article for the Harvard law review so there are lots of questions about President Obama's background but you're right that's passed you know who brought this back up this week Elizabeth Warren did she decided\nThat that that second plane go in that they go ahead\nAnd take a shower and this is a great do you think about like well it was in it and the basketball\nCourt that ... well they were talking about the compassionate that Donald Trump which I don't see it all day and then they were talking also about his 'em like they have taken\nA little town which I don't see it all day and then they were talking also about his um what they have stayed in the fact that I very much at my doctor for it I'm at on his feet and\nThey were saying that um that Donald Trump and sounds critics I that would have ended up on a minute that\nHe um did it on that that happened I wouldn't have made it if it had not been for you know what he was sane at the rally about publicity if our president actually\nHumiliated a woman who said that the one that name thing she remembered what people laughing and if you didn't it Prager and Sebastian\nAnd then last after that caused the rally to laugh and the people who might be watching the valley to laugh\nAt Dr Ford so that he could get have enough ... and I think I don't see that that booklet me\nEnjoy me joy to take a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation the Dr Ford made was very\nThinly evidence she couldn't remember most of the details that would be the details necessary to prove something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that it ever even happened in front of her best friend so she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet the doctor for a professor Ford or said that her best friend was there when this awful thing was supposed to happen\nThe reason there is so much anger\nAt a Christian a blazing four to ... Ford is that she made a career and frankly person destroying accusation\nAnd did it was nothing that she did it with nothing to back it up right but I don't hold hold on I've got to push back about her life is destroyed\nCan I tell you what's already happened and what is likely to happen Dr ... a professor Ford has received over a million dollars from or go fund me account she will get a book

you want to join the conversation and\nTalk journalism and ... that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com you know I remember it wasn't that many years ago\nThat a president named Obama was telling Americans word peak oil we're going to be running out of oil so we have to get away from oil just as fast as we possibly can and then of course we've seen the energy revolution over about the last decade\nOr so in which America is gone from a big importer in heavily dependent on foreign sources of oil to not only self sufficient but literally enough energy in oil and natural gas\nThat we can literally export a lot of it and then we have abundance supply and we don't have to be beholden to foreign shakes or Venezuela or nasty people like that\nSo but we still have politicians who are trying to push us out from away away from oil um build the bonds you a mayor of New York is calling on cities to give up their investments in the oil industry\nAnd I thought I talked to Dan kiss you about that who is senior vice president at the policy and foreign policy at the Institute for energy research Dan welcome back\nEven Lars\nSo what do you what's your first blush impression of Mayor Bill de Blasio apparently deciding that his mandate as mayor is not just run the biggest city in the country but also to talk all the other cities out of investing a dime in oil\n[noise] the uh well it seems to be a common thread among politicians who are are vying for higher office um it it it sounds good to a certain number of people out there and that\nIts virtues signaling the one it really is doing is ultimately handing off\nEnormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those pension funds\nAnd a ... to the tune for example in New York state of a one point to the one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that has to be made up by somebody ah in order to pay people's pensions and you know that's going to be ultimately the taxpayers\nWell and and so if I understand correctly he would like all the big cities who have massive pension funds that have to earn money until the people who are going to get the pensions get paid\nAnd that when if they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs and the oil stocks would be sold to willing buyers would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies will still have plenty of people who can bind them but New York will have given a given up on the returns they would have had\nFrom the ... you know ... the business of fossil fuels which is still a business that are very much supplies the energy for America so what's what's his thinking I mean do you have any idea what why he wants to do this\nWell it's all part of trying to show that you're virtuous and care about climate change Lars this is all about climate change a as all energy issues tend to be now um\nAnd what they're what they're\nTrying to say is that by taking the money out of\nOf those returns are those bills they'll simply be taking money away from these companies and they won't have the money and therefore they won't drill wells or something um they know that to be nonsense because the fact of the matter is when you compare\nPortfolios whiz energy stocks of all kinds in them versus ones with out\nOf the energy a ... perform better and\nHave perform better uh over fifty years so ... basically what you're [laughter] you're cutting off your nose to spite your face in some respects\nI mean aren't because the only way for a city to pull money out we talk about it like it's pulling out a drawer but the only way to pull out of a stock is to sell it to somebody else so you'll have willing buyers who will buy those stocks will win the willing buyers bind them\nThe oil company has an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they could if the city of New York one step of fires\nAnd the oil company has an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they could if the city of New York wants to have a fire\nSale and sell their their all their socks and if they announce they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers are going to say great they're going to give us as we deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and end up selling it to people for less money than they paid for it that's potentially possible but the ... the stock will still be owned by somebody but as you say\nTheir stock portfolio they can't replace that stock with the stock that performs as well as the oil stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the other civil service workers of New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state or the controller who who is in charge of the sudden he has something called a fiduciary responsibility which\nAh anyone who manages money tends to have and you're supposed to watch out for those interests to make sure that you don't make bad investments that take away from the value of those people who own shares in it\nAnd those would be the firemen and the police but and civil servants of all time and um and he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because he knows the\nThe record and can show that and can show with enormous loss to the city end of the state because it's not just a ... it's also Governor Cuomo ... well\nCan they even legally divest themselves of the stocks of the controller says no this would cause a loss can he prevent them from doing\nIt varies from state to state and it gets a little dicey because you're dealing with these public funds which don't have the say and some of the same requirements are obviously because so many of them are underfunded Lars I mean we hear all the time about the states that have massive\nPension obligations that can afford them Illinois and New York California um\nAnd and so there's a little more leeway in that situation but the for the person in charge are they still\nAttempt to live up to the fiduciary responsibility so uh it's not as ironclad is if you were dealing with a a U.S chartered bank or something like that\n... well it'll be interesting to see what they do because I I I just I I think it's highly irresponsible for them to do this and the other thing is New York city itself can't run without fossil fuels candidate they can't run on diesel gasoline and natural gas\nUh no it would have a very very hard time and the northeast is\nGetting increasingly\nIn bad shape as a consequence of bad decisions that won't allow pipelines rebuilt and that sort of thing so we'll see what the winter holds but last winter they barely escaped it and\nUh it's it's probably gotten worse ah and if we get a cold winter will will be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nYou know it'd be interesting uh I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine\nIf the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you want to get out of fossil fuels find we will stop delivery\nOf fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know it we won't cut off the you know the oil heat that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supplying gasoline and will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine I mean as much as Manhattan\nRuns on mass transit they also run on over and cabs\nAnd diesel powered buses and the like can you imagine this and Jazz Can you imagine where they'd be if fossil fueled a liquid fuel delivery stopped to say filling stations and the and the local airport\n[noise] ah that would be one of those what did President Obama used to always tell us that it's a of educational\nMoment or [laughter] something like that teachable moment teachable moment and just say you want to try it well I'll tell you what will just slow it down and we'll cut our deliveries to half\nAnd and the New Yorkers who who ... who didn't get a chance to see the gasoline station lines of the early Nineteen seventies could sit in line for an hour\nBegan wind Twenty one twenty two year we're joined by natural aid for we wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for the rich\nI'm twenty two words when I was kind of natural April we wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education that was that so unreasonable no and in specially\nSteve I remembered nominally I work all the way through the year and a half or you know the school but I did and then I took part time class after that but\nI knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars in the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank and they'd have half\nThere or have their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way it allows those kinds of people 'cause I remember when I was in college my senior year I live with four guys in the house to model and financial aid and the other two were working which to do you think got a better uh you know get more out of their education\nYou know ... and Steve\nI had to find your market ... actually had to work to earn it so they actually knew the value of the education if you give something way that people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think that would be an area we can get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what the employers\nWill give these workers the skills they will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or you know be a welder or you know all of these that by the way in Texas now you know what's truck drivers are earning my them twenty thousand dollars oh\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who'd come to a station event a listener in a band\nAnd I was talking to a guy and a younger guy and they just were friends\nAnd I said uh what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that I said I I Know there were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you and the ... two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it's like twenty nine thousand a year\nAnd every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class four hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't\nYou know it wasn't asking him to go sixteen hours a day all week long that at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was unofficially state approved process where you at the end of four years you had eight thousand on the job training hours working at his and then and then you have six or seven hundred hours in a classroom\nAnd every if you stayed in the program you started and fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty an hour three thousand bucks a year out and by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year and your salary while I said\nTo this guy said so that's where you're hiring your journey man he says large we can't get journeyman for thirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty two dollars an hour that's Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what this disabled that story is meanwhile we spent two hundred thousand dollars and you know a cost to the taxpayer\nTo put these kids through college and a half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or political science degree I guess what they're not jobs for a political science degree or geology degree you've got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure of education system Lars we're not preparing\nYou know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century house when I was in high school I don't know if you had this we had shop class so we did we did have had any knock it hey you know what they have their touchy feely classes now\n[laughter] it's just it's the education system is not a parent we spend\n... trillion dollars a year our education system hours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we got to ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there probably ten million Americans of working age they could be working and should be working\nBut um even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean may mean you can't work on the assembly line but you could be at overdrive or do you ...\nYou know work as a clerk I mean ever we need we need all hands on deck how everybody working\nI've got I've got a suggestion see even that is that in all these committees that got rid of the shop class and maybe even got rid of all the physical facilities what would happen\nIf they went to some of the industries in their area and said hey we want to teach kids how to do shop but we need we need to to we'll give you the space in one of our buildings\nBut what we need is we need some ... some ... and all this stuff for my shop classes and and we're going to teach these kids how to do it and then you can do the final you know O. J. T. when they actually get on the job I have a feeling there industries out there would say oh they're doing I'd be happy\nTo latch happening now that is happening the problem is they can't get enough kids to sign up the classes well we moved to an ethics where somehow it's terrible to act to work with your hands in this country\nThat is sad Steve Moore is the author of fueling\nWell you know we moved to an ethics were somehow it's terrible to act to work with your hands in this country\nThat is sad Steve Moore is the author of fueling freedom exposing the mad or an energy Steve\nThank you for the time denied going up to the Supreme Court be forced to consider DACA\nDuring the Supreme Court term will talk to that I'll get your phone calls and emails to at age ... four three nine five to seven so [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nResults may vary notice solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS back taxes payroll taxes or I'm not found your returns the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one called to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our\nAverage clients settles for about ten percent of what is owed we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three results\nMay very not a solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS back taxes payroll taxes or I'm not filed you return the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients settles for about ten percent of what is owed we offer free face to face consultations in your local area called eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three\nAttention all authors page publishing as looking for authors have you read the book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects\nOf the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing ... eight hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author submission get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author somebody should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nBackyards looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a debt to no one could contractors why don't you just ask ... advisor home one home advisor dot com\nYou just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice but how much does it cost him home advisors totally free to use plus you can reach customer reviews check pricing book appointments for free what's the website again home\nAdvisor dot com or just download the bring home advisor ...

Lars Larson dot com you know for decades TV shows and books and of course the Terminator franchise of all suggested that the world will soon have wars in which the primary combatants\nA robot but does that fantasy actually becoming reality is that a bad thing or a good thing I thought we did invite Dr Michael Guillen on who's an author Emmy Award winning science correspondent for ABC News of during regularly on good morning America Nightline and world news tonight and the host of the History Channel series where did it come from\nDr going thanks for taking the time tonight\nHey Lars or it's my pleasure I literally just got off an airplane from Amsterdam uh I'm In New York a lot of the book so you're you're my first time in a taxi cab I Hope this works\nWell I'm Glad to hear it a you know and and the thing is I Hope you're not ... because I've taken some of those long flights a few of them and and they're not fought\nYeah isn't it especially since I started this morning from crack out all and I was speaking yesterday to huge crowd and that went from ... out of Amsterdam ... in New York but you know what I'm feeling good and large it's good to hear your voice my brother\nWas nice to talk to you as well so he's I mean we've seen the horror shows that are some of the science fiction movies about robot wars but would it be the worst thing in the world if\nSome of the battles that I guess have to be fought we don't have a worldwide conflict going on right now we're kind of in a ... one of the most peaceful period in human history ah so what would it be a bad thing if the combatants\nWere machines rather than human beings\nYou know I I I think the short answer is no as long as they're all robots um you know there's the concern right now the large is um ... there is some\n... ... we lost him being up you know I I I ... you were gone for a second and I was worried about you heading for a tunnel is as people oh I get new ... know you were saying no\nI I uh yeah hopefully it at some point I don't know I was saying that I Know I don't think that it's a bad thing that robots takeover on bad you know the human lives and that's a good thing that concerned though is that\nWe're in countries are not up front about this uh so there's some question about it but a country like Russia\nGood thing that concerned though is that we're up in countries are not up front about this uh so there's some question about it but ah countries like Russia for example have been pretty a pretty clear that they want to create robots that will battles human\n... and and that will have and this is and this is the kicker liars will have the ability to decide that that to to kill or not and I've always there'll be completely a ton of us ... do you can imagine what kind of a horse scenario that could create\nUm if you have robots that have been given permission to go kill people I'm so that\nThat's the concern but if it's all robot warfare and they become our surrogates and the fact that you know it was less of a last robot stand is the winner um I don't think that's a bad thing you know a recently in Japan for example when they had that nuclear power\nA disaster they sent robots send a check check out the ah the melted core\nSo in cases like that where you have very dangerous situations or ... outright combat\nI think that's a that's not a bad thing for robots take over from us\nWell let me ask you this though doctor because we've had\nA smart and and smarter devices I mean the the the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima Nagasaki were dumb bombs I mean they were ... were electronic\nTo some degree but they were done then we have smart bombs are going to actually steer themselves so when we talk about whether or not we would use a machine to fight against human beings human warriors are rather than noting our own people's lives up front\nWhere are we kind of talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pen and philosophical questions about if you can employers smart weapon that steers itself to the target and now you have a smarter weapon that not only steers itself to the target and decides which target to take out is there much of a solvable difference at the end of the day\nThat's a good question Lars and probably not at the concern is they'll all you need is one country\nTo decide that they are going to create a ton of us combat ride robotic combat and that's going to force the hand of every other country to do the same thing so suddenly we're going to find ourselves\nIn a kind of ... situation of the arms race during the Cold War when you know a Russia said well I have you know X number of evolves and us said well we have ... plus one number of eight bombs and you know ah that that can just escalate the situation and it's very very critical um\nI you know we're entering into some very unknown territory bottom line I think for for me looking at the immediate future and even right now um the the thing that gives me the greatest concern our robots that are going to take people's jobs it's already happening\nAnd uh in my new book uh\nUh the end of life as we know and I cite some studies recently that said you know up to fifty percent or more jobs right now\nCan be automated and are and not just blue collar jobs large white collar pink collar I'm a jobs and and that can sense because if you put people out of work what are they going to do\nWell mom doctor I I Love this conversation we needed a schedule more time but we'll do that in another time because let me ask you didn't every forklift on a dock that unload just shift ship take away jobs of of ten or twenty guys who would have used their backs\nOr a or a hand truck to manually you know so you got a whole bunch of strong guys and I think it was probably almost exclusively guys picking up sacks of grain or Saxon\nSomething or boxes or something and hauling it off and all of a sudden we have a a crane in a forklift and we didn't need ten of those guys but we found jobs for them doing other things are society did hasn't always been were progress has gone ...\nYeah and that's kind of the argument that off them make a ... we saw that even as recently as computers you know when computers took over you know we lost a lot of secretaries a lotta secretarial positions than others but then we created Silicon Valley\nWhich is seen employing huge numbers of people so in the best case scenario Lars that will happen that the for every ... job\nIt takes over it'll create another job for people who are who need to maintain those robots but there is a critical critical difference between a forklift or you know other kinds of mechanical aids we've invented in the past and that is the robot is not\nDesigned nearly to do a single task it's actually designed to replace us period right\nAnd so we have computers now that are actually being developed to maintain the computers we have computers now that are even replacing a or threatening to replace computer ... a software developers\nWhich is the ultimate irony right that these computer developers are creating the robots that are going to put them out of a job so it's not I I'm waiting to see what\nBut these computer developers are creating the robots that are going to put them out of a job so it's not\nI I'm waiting to see what will happen but that is the most optimistic the most pessimistic though and and this is the pessimism that has shared a lot of very critical people scientists studies is that there won't be a um jobs created\nTo ... to offset the jobs that are lost and you know we often talk about robots taking over the world and revolt against your lives and so forth but the thing that I discuss in my book that you really need to take seriously is that will people recall if they find themselves\nYou know out of a job in their livelihoods are are stolen from them and I give examples of ... people whose jobs have been stolen not once twice three times you know then what are you going to do and that and that\nIs a very real a danger and people in Silicon valley have what are called ... houses\nA witch and they'll be very upfront about about it that that's where they're going to retreat is you know the ... you know what it is so um ... we don't know yet as to some degree we still have control over laws and that's why I've written this book so that people will be willing arm can help make wise decisions\nWell I Want you to do that and maybe you and I could get together will make a business creating wouldn't shoes that can be thrown into the gears of the robots what what does that\nYou know out of the Congress have them write a bill and say this is why it makes sense to spend five million bucks in the school district or fifty million and that one on on these specific programs would make them justify other than that\nTake the whole deal we not department of Energy Department of education and simply do away with it there's a trillion dollars right there isn't it\nYeah well ours is where you are in are the same room right now I'd give you a big hug [laughter] but specific like let's go back to the penny plan for a second yeah that's the one percent spending reduction act\nWas introduced in this Congress by congressman Mark Sanford who unfortunately lost his primary that won't be returning to Congress but he has pushed as you caught one percent across the board of one percent of non injury spending so it doesn't apply to interest on the national\nDebt but it applies to everything else you do that for five years the balance the budget and then that bill would cap\nSpending at Eighteen percent of gross domestic product basically Eighteen percent of all economic output in the United states uh for for the foreseeable future that's what that bill would do that would solve a lot of our problems in terms of the looming entitlement and not sovereign debt crisis that we face here in the United states is the problem here is we're looking at\nEuropean welfare style of rates of federal spending within a short time we are talking the next Twenty years that's what we're going to be spending and we cannot produce you cannot have\nStrong economic growth you cannot create incentives to work in safe with that level of spending it's going to crowd out private investment gets people will be investing into government T bonds rather than investing in their business or the economy\nRight those are the problems were seen as those problems we face and you're not going to be able to produce the amount of revenue unique because people are simply are going to be disincentive eyes to work with the with the level of taxation well going to be needed to to lower death\nOkay Jason another idea just a wild idea we're right now we have seven point one million unfilled jobs in America and I would if I were king but we're not a kingdom but if I were King I would say All right we're going to immediately say to every single state we're no longer paying for\nAny social welfare benefits for this class of people everybody who is above the age of Nineteen let's say and below the age of fifty five so working age\nAble bodied son to mind a and we'll start with the kids who have no kids who the people who have no kids at home but we're soon going to get to the people who do have kids at home and say you have to go get a job there seven million jobs go get\nOne of them but we are at like Paul ... page did a main saying we're not\nPaying ... we're not paying food stamps for example he cut the food stamp rules by Seventy five percent and that group of people immediately when he said you have to work or you don't get food stamps and a lot of people just simply quit now that would have to say the least tens\nOf billions wouldn't it if we did that to you know Medicaid food stamps tennis and all the rest of that razzmatazz oh abs\nAbsolutely yeah I Know that and and look the house to to their credit I mean I'm not the biggest fan of House Republican leadership but occasionally they do something right and they tried to do that in the farm bill this year was the ads\nWork ... to uh to food stamps I'm ... and the granted the savings were reinvest it into work training programs which kind of\nA it didn't defeat the purpose of just defeated the it just took the savings out of the bill but it would have saved billions of dollars are unfortunately the Senate decided not to pursue that in fact the Senate voted down um and uh\nBut it just took the savings out of the bill but it would have saved billions of dollars a unfortunately the Senate decided not to pursue that in fact the Senate voted down I'm In an amendment offered by senators I think a likelihood Ted Cruz that would have put wealth or ... or ... on a snap\nBenefits or food stamp benefits uh the Senate's been has been and will continue to be the source of most of our problems are and moving a a more fiscally conservative agenda because there are too few fiscal conservatives and the Senate\nEven if we get a few more senators in November\nWell let me look that certainly numbers will improve their there's ... there's some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see uh some of those come to fruition but I'm the ... we have a problem ... you we may be able to do things that we weren't able to do with more senators a Republican senators and the Senate but um you still have\nTo you is all a numbers game at the end of the day and like one of the reasons we got a spending

and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark\nHow are you there I'm here I'm okay uh my thought is\nThat John K sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I know you can find it a public and yeah he did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget and you know whoever can balance a budget that's who I think should run against Trump\nOr you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing\nWe've had just government spending that's\nGone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd somehow you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget that would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump\nAlthough I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nConserve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nOr you have now I Do not have coffee with is Nikki Haley I Believe she has an intellect that has a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology and I would really like to sit down and talk to her about\nWhere she thinks we used and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet that we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are a few of my thoughts what do you think mark\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... is amazing because the lady and surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal a ambassador to the United nations really letting them having\nAn a very courageous not being afraid to say like it is she's a very impressive lady I think she's going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I I don't have someone with a very large perspective on who we are as a nation and where we\nWe can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in the global perspective I think that's very important so thanks for those ideas and\nWe'll let it hold on one second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer the question but I don't like joined case if there's something about the guy or they didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I\nDon't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but the something personally about him I I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that when I've heard some things about him I had a former a producer\nMy TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor but something about that guy\nAnd rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nWhile I have to balance budget I mean [noise]\nMan we we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nThen you know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody has another lobbyist that you know want something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle you know and it's just been going on and on and on\nAnd they can't go on forever I mean\nWhen you get to the point where the debt is bigger than gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy and\nWe we gotta we gotta find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of government spending we ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government has\nNo money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that a woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that are Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to where's he going to yeah I have a stash stash you know\n... ... he was going to personally pain so people don't know that based on some tests\nAsh stash\nCame out of his stash right she he was going to personally paid so people don't know that they said that the government has no money of its own a thank you very much for your call very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye

Heidi Heitkamp whatever name is ah she's in big trouble and in fact the way it is the\nWhole ... a Kevin a fiasco has helped the Republicans just the Democrats were always a ... they were always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in\nFact of having a hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house the house representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nights if they take back\nThe house you're in the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to teach Trump with earrings with subpoena powers ah with calling for their impeachment is not going to be fun\nNo ... I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that\nThat wouldn't be crazy I mean I I honestly didn't do anything for that to me I didn't read any of that but it did not live without credible to me um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most\nHonest I used one of the water the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got old senator we've got you\nKnow I was going to say he seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is you know in her case I just think that we're using her as long as we're talking about who should run for president a Democrat side are Spartacus Booker and I call them that because of his own name\nThe Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined that if someone didn't do that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a little difficult it was\nHorrible it was it really was a well anyway I was ... he was\nYeah that sort of Lindsey Graham was so good when he came out and said uh I'm not going to put up with the stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do a but that's what they are they ought to be\nYeah well thank you so much for\nThe absolutely I'll I'll definitely call back again\nThanks so much to him and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy\nUh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage a winning seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this is Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again for selfish reasons I think she's going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the each one is an aphrodisiac people say\nSo and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election forcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now\nThe former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense\nAs I've said on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost like she's going to come out I suggest that she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her and I said she could join OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out\nWho killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns that a high profile Clinton presence but only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah and they're worried about her for the midterm elections Clinton is rarely\nRally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and low key 'cause you can't get many people to show up she's the kiss of death when a party official said yeah I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well\nWorse than I thought and it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and\nThat's a real testament to her Democrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was clever move\nI think they're measuring how they can have the best possible impact than have kind decided to wait until after the election and that's what the Durbin of Illinois said a house Democrat segment of that saying when I think people who have been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a\nVery good things and they're not being visible it wouldn't help our candidates\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage actually but I like the Hillary in in twenty twenty I liked the sound of aid and\nI like our possibility that she could run you know like our stamps she could run forever right but don't we have forever stamps forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually I can take them a lot better\nThan Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give credit to George W.

I think the cheapest ticket is a Seventy five\nDollars okay they're gonna be\nI think the cheapest ticket is a Seventy five dollars okay they're going to be a down in walling for it and uh again it's

final tally\nAs far as how much they're going to uh make but somebody said it could be over a thousand dollars for for a ticket for some of them are they got tickets that are uh Seventy five I think Seventy five is the lowest but we'll we'll have\nThat for you as soon as it is a a finalized it's not finalized yet but uh it's gonna be interesting\nAnd then of course uh uh when the two of them come

I don't know how many ah a former Marines or Marines are listening to my program this morning but I have\nA very interesting a very interesting piece a president Donald Trump awarded the medal of

nation's highest military honor in the East Room of the White House for his auctions\nDuring the battle hue city\nIn February of Nineteen sixty eight and that was a not only an auction after\nThe battle but uh it was unbelievable action as well\nWhich Trump regarded as one of the quote one of the bloodiest and he praised or the marine and a a sad what a gun or a sergeant\nHe is helped or injured Marines to safety despite his own injuries eight took command and led his company after his commanding officer was severely injured while leading them\nIn the a huge city or kill al\nAlso scaled the wall of a hospital compound\nAnd exposed himself to enemy fire to save injured Marines he personally say a total of twenty\nMarines and has just received\nThe medal of honor you know you you have to wonder and I do a lot of ... in fact I've got the book I told you about this\nI've got the book that is all about the medal of honor and has Marines that have won the medal of honor and what they did to win it I've got it on my desk in the office and it's just incredible\nUh what they are what they have have done\nAnd it's not only Marines its army\nAir force its its members of the armed forces but when you are or take a look at some of the things that have\nBeen accomplished by all of our servicemen\nAnd women are you are you're just a just\nSuch pride you really really do and when I got a hold of this uh this note uh this morning that was a sent a two days ago a by the by the president or to the\nOh just this morning that was a cent a day two days ago a by the by the president\n... uh to the award ceremony ... uh you just have to say how could somebody do this but so many of them that did it now I don't know how many of you are\nYou like to read as some of these military things but I Want to tell you something and I as I said I have\nIt on my desk here at the office I uh I just read it from time to time\nAnd a marvel at what our servicemen and women have done and sometimes you wonder sometimes you wonder about this and a appreciate what they have done for for all of us really\nSo I just wanted to mention that uh this morning for you twenty seven minutes after\nThe hour of five o'clock one eight eight eight five seven four to seven to three if any of you have anything you'd like to bring to the broadcast\nDesk they a\nDemolition of trinity ... church in Waterbury has struck a nerve with some residents it was built in the late Eighteen hundreds another story\nI just received this morning it was like a kick in my stomach shed Laurie Sabine ...\nThe demolition of trinity was a real wakeup call\nSaid Rachel guest to veto any gifts to are trying to rally community support to protect and save\nWater berries older a historic buildings we had been pretty complacent about our history properties assuming\nThat they were protected but they weren't so I'm sure a\n... a folks in Waterbury we'll have more to say about this uh they held a community meeting last night\nAt the silos Brunson library next to Waterbury city hall hoping that a representative from the Connecticut trust for historic preservation would help provide advise and guide\nThem where the future this is really you know when you stop to think about this is something and it doesn't surprise me ... and a Waterbury has a certain a certain something it's kinda hard to define but the the folks\nThis kind of an impact before\nWow it must have been feeling good last night but ah you know\nIf you have seen any of the television and you've seen the crowds it is just unreal\nThe number of people that he uh drugs but you have to understand yes he is the president of the United states\nBut he is also he is also a star I mean to a television everything that he does and by the way I don't know how many of you stay up late at night and watched the late late shows okay\nBut how many of you have seen Trump Trump Trump Trump respect your everything and the ratings through the roof so uh they're not foolish\nNope they want to be number one they want to be up near the top these are fellows who run these shows\nAnd so I guess they just showed his picture and talk about Trump but people are and and give them the business of course and people love that\nSo it's very very interesting very interesting to to think about it and wonder how it's all going to turn out I I don't know\nI really don't I ah I really I really don't I think that a\nTrump spoke on a range of subjects\nThe defending Saudi Arabia from a growing or any worse than they are but again I I just think we're going to have to wait and see I I don't think uh and I would love to hear from you because I Know there are\nAnd I I just think we're going to have to wait and see I I I don't think uh and I I Would\nLove to hear from you because I Know there are many many Trump fans that listen to us and to see what you think\nBut it's a I think this is going to be a tough one I Do maybe I'm wrong but I

I'm looking forward to hearing uh probably I think one of the best state senators that we've got\nAnd are you are going to introduce you might have to stand is that correct well ... are are longtime friend so you've been eight he's been on the program but you know something you know he doesn't want to be governor now eight we I don't know what the other\nDay does not want to be done but this morning he wants to talk about the fact that you know a good example I think coming out of New Haven as to what happens when you have one party rule then you have a you know a mayor's office there apparently just spending money even the upsetting members of her own party\nFrom ever going forward which makes no sense to me why wouldn't you want to be forthright with what you're doing with the money um and this is the reason why we wanted to do this we can look at it you see how\nThe money is being spent and when you see on reported expenses or an estimate of acts and it turns out to be four times expert trip you need to question is this the tip of the iceberg\nIs there are more that we don't know about is there more waste which we all suspect every government has ways but we need to look at it and that's why\nI wrote a letter to say look bring confidence if this is an isolated incident I get it prove it to us was just to have friends that go on it some departments to get a flavor of what you're doing with our money\nYou know I just wanted to say when I first read the story I could not believe that ... heart diverted nearly\nFour K. from the fire department for a uniforms for her administrative staff\nI I I I couldn't believe it I thought I was misreading something\nIt is quite amazing ah my understanding is that making that up\nBut nevertheless why would you ever think that's appropriate the firemen in New haven have a tough job but we all rely upon them they've got a tough job and they can use equipment that are for their services are and you don't win it New Haven is a tough town\nAnd because of one party rule and because of the power structure people are afraid to talk you know they are I'm not making this up they are\nAnd I'm so people the fire department are afraid to say hey it's not we need more equipment we need this you did this because the retribution can be quite difficult to prevent\nOh yeah I mean I mean look a lend you and I grew up in the area we know how the how the power politics works in New haven in fact all the major cities in the state in in in in ... and again it was explains or Brad earlier on and to the listeners here Len is is we really entered a new era where you know in the past\nSay in New haven you know as well as I Do yeah had democratic administrations by remembering dealing with people like John DeStefano and a\nAnd a bar guy to and and uh and bend Toledo you know they you know ... they always understood that you had to\nHave a accountability and you couldn't spend tax money from the people of New Haven or in the state revenues liget was water and and and and sadly I I think with the new wave of politicians that seems to be lost now I don't know about you but that's how I feel\nI I think there's been a change and the people say we'll let why do you care you know you don't represent New Haven was born and raised like you live around the eerie all my life and who he was a great city\nAnd you say it's Nate money as you say it it actually does reflect on state grants yeah\nYeah no question no question but we just went up in New haven I'm aware of a percent\n... and ... and I couldn't that's another story could lead in ... I'm not real\nQuestion no question but we just went up in New haven or ... percent\nTen eleven ... and ... that's another story could lead in ... I'm not real most cities and towns go one percent one and a half to orange ... eleven percent Lynn\nEleven percent on the heels of races get them out to a managers\nSo what I'm saying is look we can't afford to have to go by the way of hard for you right which is in deep trouble we all know that was getting better though in deep trouble sets in deep trouble we can't look what New Haven going that way\nAnd you know they said well you know this year that will you know gives them a check every year and yelled does an awful lot for the community yeah\nAn awful lot for the ... you know doesn't brag about our talk about\nThe they they they help small businesses are if you raise your kids in New haven\nAnd they graduate from the new wave at school system I think there's some ability that they pay for some college stuff you know I'm so they do an awful lot you'll does in there's only so much that they can do so but it's incumbent upon the administration to say what do we need to do what our once one on each week to reevaluate\nBut if you keep going up on taxes you're gonna drive businesses they're starting to come to New Haven out in New haven was a great place to get those who haven't been to New Haven eat let me tell you we've got one of the best restaurant of variety in New haven oily really good restaurant\nAnd still the number one he took place in American ... don't forget that\n[laughter] and the place and you know it's a great place to come and have a good time and enjoy the night uh atmosphere but we have to get businesses here we have to get a\nMore of an economic base here and we're we're challenge because we're competing with others and going up ... percent by the way still have a budget deficit\nOr speaks to a city that's in that needs help and we can figure out in the economy and I don't think Tony harm and I I liked her as a person I really do\nUh but I think needs to be where you reevaluate or economic positions\nAnd when she was ahead of appropriations and they'll have that I mean in the state you know we saw that she went for the largest tax increase of Connecticut's history things taxes are the answer and they're not the answer that's how you you you wreck your economy\nAnd businesses will say why am I going to go to a city that like the state has perpetual deficits going up and property taxes every year I'll go to northeast and I'll go to Branford I'll go to\nA hand it may be but they have high taxes to go someplace else as opposed to sit in the city we\nThis is a beautiful city at all I'm saying is I'm not against Tony heart I may or heart but what I Am saying is someone's going to open up some people's eyes and say we need to rethink where we are so we can make this a better place was work together to get to that place\nSenator I I just want to leave you with a little something perhaps that you haven't seen yet but uh we got a a notification or this morning about a Hartford uh jobs source the website glass\nDoor has surveyed cities across the nation and rank the top twenty five cities for jobs in what he Eighteen\nAnd Hartford hyper the job market being recognized a write up near the top ranked number five\nIn the country with forty thousand nine hundred and Seventy eight job openings fifty five thousand dollars as medium base salary and two hundred and twenty seven thousand six hundred\nFor medium home values and Boston fell behind Hartford to number six what do you think of that\nWell you know I I have to I did hear about that either last night last night or this morning and I can't recall but um I like to see the correct you're I'm sure there are a lot of job openings in Hartford and the values houses are probably going down because the taxes are going up [noise] um and\nI think that maybe there's just not enough people who are moving people are moving out of Hartford\nThere's a lot of people who feel the jobs that they do have there I'm not sure speaks to a ... a or a Sunday good comedy as much as it does as to concerns about\nNot being able to get people to work and in Hartford yeah that's what I Want to take a look at this and analyze it uh and I just haven't um\nYou know I think they are ... personally like as well as trying to do the best you can in Hartford [noise] um and but he has significant challenges\nDidn't I didn't land I wasn't ... throwing a curve ball I was surprised\nI'm In ...\nI didn't I didn't I wasn't ... throwing a curve ball I was surprised when we both were so the eyes were the other uh this morning but uh you know\nBut again just delighted

closest the\nGreat Len thanks so much we appreciate it thank you land use for each of the guys but yep seven forty eight twelve before eight o'clock right here in the morning forty one guy stepped outside a little while ago you said earlier when\nYou think that this all of these things are going to come back better than they've ever been\nAny I think I see I got a gut feeling that because what happens is now you're seeing bread I think in the cities in Hartford [noise]\nUsing a generational change and now you know you've got young people who want to stay in cities were getting out of colleges and everything in life read to me is cyclical it's up and down it's a pendulum nothing stays the same whether it's\nYou know whether it's the economy whether it's a the environment or whatever so you know I think I I think Connecticut cities if\nThey're managed properly can be back on the upswing again so also ...\nComing up to twelve minutes now for the hour I'll tell you the

talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation\nAnd embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country find now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I thought I'd Chris chrome or a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior a ... for the president he really is\nYou know he he's a Latino in his ... his parents came here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I looked at as a model\nHe I Know when I get on CNN\nAfter defending the president I get so many threats some of the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're on the uh the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to fancy private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics constant cries of racism\nOr an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear and I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here\nAnd hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nCan learn from our bureau in income and toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I I've been in politics in the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met ... back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it was\nPeople like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan screwed up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and add backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never\nHave stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened when the president just said simply no I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have the uh uh uh Bruce ... and ... from a Brett Kavanaugh response\nLooking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve and confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam and Eve ... Lindsey Graham was a hero of German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised does the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that over and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working\nEvery day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction in five five forty Laura every poll that's been down in the last few years on immigration shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year and a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June\nUh thirty seven percent wanting to level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty nine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenience factor\nThe inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrants for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less so you know\nPeople don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area and a ... year a year or so we've seen you know truckloads of illegal illegal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven on their way back\nFrom a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen\nA chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and was in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash on e just got a found guilty the other day of this kind of crackdown\nNeeds to continue because I'll tell you in western New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back\nTo the leadership of president Donald Trump but men and women here need these jobs need these jobs and and they they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas\nLight them on this issue talking about how important a immigration and for the United states\nWhen they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining as illegal immigration\nFor president isn't against immigration is against illegal immigration and and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process and then the citizenship process\nIt's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it and the problem she sees\nIs it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now ... says Amazon from\nIts in its infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form\nA and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people\nAn orderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar I'm Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets in the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nA and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the ...\nKavanaugh a and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIs true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the the uh the people running down the ... are always a base of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people ...\nSenators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs people outside the capital and\nAfter he was confirmed that people trying to literally rats with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if they like that\nThey're going to love twenty Nineteen\nIf the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the\nHouse because a lot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call a deplorable right that people who had\nVoted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion in Donald Trump someone they bought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election those kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school\nSo they can go vote on

congressional district where\nMarty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat lefty Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as a person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist within the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy\nImmigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight lower\nFirst of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban corps of Allentown Beth I'm an eastern to the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late dealt a region ... what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy\nPeople are happy with this economy they're happy with what our presents been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\n[noise] what what a ... when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what is traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection but on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border\nOr even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth people don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the last uh the rush of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen\nUm most people I'm Talking too I'm sure the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform uh we need to secure southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration\nAppear in Lehigh Valley in ... seven district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... what would they tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or something\nIn your district\nThat's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran and her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a result speak\nFor themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and\nBureaucracy you know for impeaching the president and teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that and then there are commercials she wants the than any public forums but the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she was going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that\nOr go backward I I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back\nThey don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and and I'm In raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nI think it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal\nUm you're right they show up and mobs uh we uh we announced the campaign um our our brand opening of arcane campaign headquarters\nThe night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in ... district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd hunted and funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America's standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stay in a ... I Can't wait to see you in Congress\n[noise]\nWhere do you think that's going to do to the country it's already happening now it's already happening federal services to illegal immigrants soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating rights for this or rights to that birthright citizenship all of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country\nOr the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if it Barbara Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this\nFairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies\nFollow always liberal policies always follow wear\nA mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the ah African Americans and Latinos in\nPoll after poll will tell us that\nIs adversely affected their communities because it has I'll give you that a stat and just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni who converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saudi council that Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post a is a was murdered and apparently it's on Donald Trump's falls\nDr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they are\nStory mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\n[noise] figure much for having me every day for the ship the local tendency in and you're right when you have a party that is run by the by then and ah ah you know those old ah guards it's it looks like they are brought in from inside when I I I think actually this um you\nKnow story about uh the reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on the election if we're not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this\nWhen you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a\nYou know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and and also to dictators and so forth which is far from true if you listened to Trump in his last quarter August before this incident broke out embarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times\nAnd that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not um back in the south is because he loves the dumps dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense he's doing this because the Saudi Government the government the government\nIs doing a good work that helps them not states and he's in America first un American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous president without states\nAnd why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gum prince and the Saudi Government is doing\nTheir head thinking many fronts the number one is\nThe author hunting by defending the Islamic movement by looking or in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia I Know they are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they all had been denied states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east\nThere hunting big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how it on Trump is up within goes on by living the oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about announced that are very very soon\nWhat is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years\nSo Donald Trump is supporting um you know the gun on\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those seasons alone and all of those head for the United states not that dictatorship and so forth plus adding all of that we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue\nAs when we have to follow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on you know\nI I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there and my ... in my home rule which you know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey\nIs very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the\nThe faster and the release of the pasture happened right at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark ... America in ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia ... this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group as a press in the United states the president loves autocrats the president ... I mean it's so\nPredictable that it's almost boring to talk about the meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about them styles and some thousands of people\nMany of them this is an adult men or young a military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally that is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story\nThe new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against that total lawlessness a dire emergency and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left\nAnd the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas which\nIs why do you always go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing but when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but go for Donald Trump\nIn a historical way and then right after that they start talking about the current events marching to the boat that of the United states and what they're trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to both would have been so this is a very well organized by the media and I have\nNo idea how they do it but I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the ... you talk about it for three days how the Hispanic is voting for Trump in a historical way and then all of a sudden we have an ... you know robbing them on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and do not Trump's days we are not going to let that happen\nAnd I think Hispanic votes water in Americans\nCan see through this because I trust it that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that\nThey'll put it that you have you're not going to be received by the uh the Biddy filthy works on the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in or been in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye and the ball people because what mark said is exactly right this is calculated and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy get Donald Trump out there on the immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start\nTurning out on math against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\nAttention you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically\nYou to turn off the trees leave the accusations actually I think that she was richly deserved to be mocked and done some nine to midnight on the talk of Connecticut WBRC you'll be assured injury W.

they have a big\nBanquet center and I went to see if they would be interested in letting us rent that whatever for a event to have all the statewide candidates there can meet and greet type thing uh when I walked in someone recognized me and asked the campaign was going and\nThen people just kind of circled around I guess [noise] um [noise] one young man was asking me a policy questions and then told me about himself he ended up on a yard sign so we gave him one and then another gentleman entered the conversation and had a lot it was a back and forth\nSeem any thing to be worried about the ... at the time I someone said something to my right and I was talking to that gal over there\nAnd the next thing I knew he yelled out a political statement was something to that effect do you believe in people don't give a bleep about the middle class and he\nWas a sucker punched me I didn't see a common [noise] and I was sitting hired the tide taller chair and I went flying back and once my head hit the ground that was all I remember oh my gosh that and I could tell you is a very big guy\nDid or did he and\nAnd I have a hundred and\nUm they did catch up with them two days later I'm found them he basically told them that are ... the deputy asked them whether or not I said or did anything to provoke him and his answer was no\n... the deputy ask them did you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him his answer was no and then the deputy asked him do you know where are you headed him and he said yeah right in the right knee I\nSoon as he arrested for assault\nThey have

civility seems to be gone and and\nI mean I I and I didn't get the the the the sense that we weren't like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but it's it is you know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is is like I said before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane ah first of all the left is trying to\nIntimidate good Americans like you from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them and if that doesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running and this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest\nLevels even those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence than ... where\nAre they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S\nBorder that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means they're justified excuse me at the end is noble and the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a ... social spending framework enforce that on the American people of all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance\nIf those are noble goals and you can get there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by\nA and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against\nHim a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him for what he did and I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background I\nI really don't um I\nI I've heard a few things sense or\nI guess they some he's in the trades of some sort of that is what I learned but beyond that I don't really know much about him ... or you know he would have cared only big guy to\nBe on that we have Democrats are in the state spoken out against this\nYou know I I actually know so like both of ours\nThat'd be have Democrats are in the state spoken out against us\nThat you know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway had come out and publicly denounced it um\nI Will say that my congressman or Tom Emmer he did call me as soon as you heard about it was the first time he's ever call me but it and you know give me as a condolence has the support and all that I was you know\nBut but other than ... no none of none of our representation of higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked at me like imagine if you needed to be the ... the thing that the the norm now it just you know go out and\nLike you said getting their faith kick them on their down whatever the comments are I got tore up for using that exact lining up Facebook response of calling out the comments from Hillary and a Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually starting a local publication as my understanding that\nHow would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota\nI don't know if they don't think we don't have a radio and TV or here\nWas [laughter] yeah so Eric Holder if they go low we can't come Hillary Clinton let's say a go low we hit hard or whatever it is she said ah\nRight yeah well it of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect\nAnd it's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative and Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre and you might imagine what they would have done Shane is a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance uh was brutalized or hit\nBy someone else a woman as let's say so concerned about just give the gender that is a conservative woman hitter said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine and I wouldn't mind you know first one I think I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely tax\nWell I could say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I Know and and and you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a poli opposite very conservative they were thought about it\nIn fact that they would tease each other you know let's go Kansas voters vote I mean it's I guess the the this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where if you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw it out and battles it says\nIt's a it's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nAh in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking them so it's a strong Republican district that with the unfortunate part is we do have an independent that sought to geo care endorsement and ran as an independent but\nAside from that but the downside to this is a I ... the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what that says I Try to tell them I only have three weeks of campaigning left and I ...

questions about anything Anthony will be here the phone numbers triple eight eight to five five two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now\nHeather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question\nI Heather Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished babysat three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashes onto babysat for\nWas not a magic answer the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this if you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah\nIf you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's a it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that\nUm but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you and twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two which you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a ... you don't have a plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to return multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby since ... when I'm ... yeah it's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so Thirty years old you're you're gay mon on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than day Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go\nYeah it's all it is high thanks for stopping by things stay open phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay I can how can I help thank\nYou very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school but the the residency included\nI I decided to specialize um and uh\nWould you get a fellow guy or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not certain as to what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that oh oh\nUm yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I'm very very bad who showed up yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I Know\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm a yeah I was I was given control this money and uh\nI've been given a very good financial advice my father uh who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually ... me or I Would like a a second opinion as to what to do with this money and give it a little bit of a Monday for living expenses um and I stay up about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs in hospitals\nThis is a man I stayed there for about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and a half set myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWill ... the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings or at least two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months we knew a basis until I needed to take them out that pay my tuition and then I Would just read that the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is the tea bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates were yields or go into the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing and the interest rate environment\nSo if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills I could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nOr as interest rates increase so it's not a very safe investment an environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross\nIncome type funds I'm but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything if you want to keep it all very very safe because that would be okay with me because\nThe most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt and if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that\nThen the whole you know is like\nA ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing and a Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julia MMS debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to\nTrying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum a you've defeated your own purpose Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now\nAs possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how real\nThat even though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call\nSure I\nI just wanted to thank you for all you do a ... mark ... it's been seven years since the husband and I had paid off our debt I'm following their plans to go for that I'm\nFrom the day is I'm not for an hour a little concerned about our parents are hoping you could give us some advice on how they could got them\nUm my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of heart pound area\nAnd I'm so every time the hurricane come through um they they experience I'm finding it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad is now\nAnd we were just wander and what you can end as far as things they'll let 'em they have now that they do have um some savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nAnd two whole often does this property blood for\nWell in Ninety nine and it flooded and it was it got like forty answers and the house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got in my dad's job I think about three feet or so and it almost it liked about six inches from getting in the house again\nAnd I'm so ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them at any town a farm ...\nThroughout this past down we actually packed the er at it and my sister was able to help them out with out of state but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nTheir mouths to his living there has become more painful than not living there\nBecause those are the fear of rising water even even at the fear is not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that has developed a phobia for them\nThey're not have my own living there sort of a son living there and why wouldn't they move right I don't care I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking every time the weather person comes on says it's raining\nBut if they're absolutely panicking every\nTime the weather person comes off as a training then it's time to move because it's not fun to live there for\nYou know it's more of an emotional decision but that's an okay decision wrong\nWith that is my phone delivering a more moving\n[noise]\nA life skills both to someone just because we're successful in one area or in starting to get a twenty six year old music star yeah\nUm well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this was a a a world class\nOne half of one percent athlete um\nBut they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter] but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a kid but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet here\nI'm In his physical ac human his physical uh I. Q. the things you can do with this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed a\nAs you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids are now is they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ... and so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier a thing where you're spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill is world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that is true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business yeah\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when an American nosy nosy for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a loan and that these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in his late ... um and the most\nMoney these kids were make will be within their first three to five years that the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like ... you have to get focus but\nWhen we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen you wrote getting you know the peanuts from North to about ... getting the graduate survival guide a book and also taken our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom because all of that\nTeaches what the old they're professionals do not know mhm if they can get at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum you know they are um a head of the game like they would teach me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like winning the world\nAnd so just to see these young kids are getting it\nTaking our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is the difference between a credit card in a debit card and these kids like man I'm not financing anything like that just gets me excited\nDown his dolled in ... in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing\nYou know the basic stuff of being out of debt being on a budget of having your emergency fund the stuff we talk about here every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty\nUh uh elastic in their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer\nOn our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay I was ... got to do that right right and they're not like all docked in and go now to argue with you about it or ... ... ... it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you know I'm a big argument like they have to have a credit card you have to have strong loan you don't\nHave to have a car payment they don't hear all that from the fourteen year old when you're able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is that we need to do to win\nAll that from the fourteen year old when we were able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is it we need to do to win\nYes sir and Dave you and I was talking about this is mark conference me when Hogan I was reading an article they're saying that this younger generation team to millennials are not entrepreneur\nAnd I'm like man that's that's a bunch of bologna the ... the generator road that's stupid [laughter]\nAnd so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they're making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learn\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in the areas of finances but they have to be taught at first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills to business skills through the teen entrepreneur tool box kid we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decisions earlier on with our middle school curriculum with the graduate survival guide\nAnd when I see these young people come up to me saying man I cannot do thank you so much for teaching me

um studies\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] you know\nTravis is in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis welcome that Iran's itself [noise] hey Dave how you don't take my\nShirt opposite hoping you could a shuttle a debate for my wife and I are old our future um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar the debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is being chased Seventy five thousand\nPeople make a decent money and we have an Iran\nThat has about two hundred and fifty and it sort of equipment and I'm Wondering what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the real question that I that I have to pay that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance inherent and she had to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inherited money I'm is who\nPlayed one lump sum\nPay off all of our debt and then ... pay ourselves back off of that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about continued repaying the uh interest game if you will her a worry about that is that the um you know she is going to be some of that aren't good for that for our retirement\nUm my coworker that is is she forty I'm thirty eight we've come up a good amount of time to be putting into our\nUm different finding out you know I guess my my question is should we go ahead and and take the distribution help all of our debt about one or longer paying the um you know the interest rates or should we go edited pay the debt down as we are\nA bit and then we'll be there for the winter we want to bring your\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance to wells\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind of it's not all\nThat minded is not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using the process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if you're is so by the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm gonna tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process\nBut you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building too is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically freeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks\nAnd uh and the second part of the things are driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent had knowledge stuff we're talking about it's not really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby steps one save a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nToo is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that three is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then for ... for a start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about whom five or so in our ... account\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach him to do is take that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was just ready to ... all your\nLife or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a night and I was a nice way to them and I are going on in my probably going to go wherever that\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know and if the ... ...\n... ... you know you gotta make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so\nIt's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those famous as you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it we're not\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred miles north of ... February ...\nA hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nUm ... you know what her financial plan or told her that she had to do it in a distributed to I'm a cover her pack a over the fear that hit hard over at the most part because the way the money out of it out yeah\nIt's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and getting invest it shot while when I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm getting a different financial advisor and uh\nI Would pay off all the debt and I'm going to invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control when no what it is and good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something\nLike that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in his kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this end to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them telling you what to do and uh it's a different different situations so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine as well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you\nBut I think he's still works for grandpa and even the rebels dead and uh that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine\nTravis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's and invest the money with what's left that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand our income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you through not only wants to do but why to do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to\nUse our system or someone else's doesn't matter to me [noise] Oscar's whether it's in

be\nUniversity ... tickets on line to reckon with an older but I'm just a good point very much doing everything you're going to be pushing there you\nGo to all my credit card um I can say that I called the credit card company to actually\nRemove those account totally out of my main that we just want to block removed ... using it better by way or\nAbsolutely absolutely and need to close the accounts completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting an activity on your credit report and it'll keep someone from accidently fraudulently you using them or are you from using them yeah I'll definitely would close the accounts as soon as I could have\nPut cards no doubt about it and talk to you Oscar monitor heavy as a new listener hold on I'll send you a copy of the book

[noise]\nThis is at our as it grows is going to be taxed that's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving the mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of ... those two things uh ... in a traditional set your situation it it teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all\nAnd the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no interest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um\nYou know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we wanted to 'em or let it grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying abroad

that everyone else has got their money act together but me I'm the only do for ... and it turns out we're all do purposes\nThat ... dot com\n\n\n\nThose in San Diego I Want to welcome Ramsey show\nDave are you doing better than I deserve sir how can I help [noise]\nOkay so um [noise] I mean my wife we've only just the one that over a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and we're not really a green aren't aware of this money should go\nOh my goodness you up and where did you get a settlement that large from\n[noise] uh I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident Mm how're you doing a A R A M I'm blessed to be here I'm actually living okay\nYou're physically coming back\nUh yeah uh ... my body recover great so I'm happy I can do this a little bit or I'm a movement issue they my shoulder but ...\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on\n[noise] so me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but she um [noise]\nWe're we're we're we're not agreeing on that she wants to put the majority of the money all over the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies ... and I and maybe the perfect time to get rid of all I ...\nAnd we also have a good amount or the home payment on a house ... and still have so much over ... she's an agreement with with that mhm and I just wanted\nMhm and still have some leftover but she is and I agree with me with that mhm and I just want to hear your opinion on the way you think would be the better move\nWell she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter]\nBut anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get a a we have about forty five thousand dollars and that\nI Would pay that off and I went home twenty back for an emergency and put to rest as your down payment\nIf I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around\nI think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble\nAnd so on and so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she wouldn't listen to me now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new lease and I'm trying to get her on board mhm but she's not really to come veins about they have also having trouble getting her on board with the plan as well and yeah\nI can imagine so um I\nHighly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay because you're going to make a mistake when you chat and I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions\nWe decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement and ah so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial peace university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to a her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nUh when I asked when I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mother would sit down with her and explained to her um you know\nGo to the classes free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it'll cause of divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan\nAnd you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that so I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others\nI'm pretty persuasive but uh but don't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up I'll give you the financial piece university membership for a year and that includes the non lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else\nUm but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how're you doing today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good faith um both my wife and I are in a few coordinators had were dead tree debt free\nAnd we need your wisdom and guided or something where we also have a little disagreement um last year the city after our son got married we loaded with money to help them out really I'd knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay [noise] um\nWhy would you do that you're ... ...\nEmail that that's a good question [laughter] a good question I maybe it's because I haven't ... for about a year that I lost touch with every mood that aspect of it\nBut um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did but in the end they did and this is how the ... and or building a ... kind of al ... well after six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back\nAnything we kind of let them know we weren't alone any more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and I knew with no communication to indicate me ordered payments back\nWell you know life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and it could not be repaired and my\nSon had no way to get to work and this is where it gets sticky let\n'em knowing that my wife and the ... parents trustworthy dispersion funds to all the fisheries recruited him we both agreed to ... to ... Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding the wood neatly pay us back when the checks or in some of the logical\nIt would immediately pay us back when the checks or in some of the logic was it they were our income on they were already keep your ... her parents trash\nUm today we have not distributed that many but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks we wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a eight thousand dollar loans to pay off for months that will do in\nThe otherwise they'd be evicted in our daughter live if there's not one to work to help out\nSo my angle is similar mirrors and because they have not given a tribute to responsibility and came back with our loan I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes way I'd\nThat my wife write the check to them have them come over and over just and we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't Bob Hope and we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple and we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation that using the hunting and everybody not clean his backers agreed and be in my opinion to be more proactive to solving this\nIs so much from nine thousand dollars\nRight ... right now what's your network now with that what's your net worth\nA ... [laughter] I don't know five hundred six hundred out your household income I'm\n... I'm thirty maybe okay ... and\n... let me here's my opinion\nThis is all your fault my fault yeah OK you loan that people money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which was you longer a family money right you're the one might mess\nI okay I take the jobs are the now I Try to correct that they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm\nWondering you could do is you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I shouldn't be given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse the\nThere are numbers you widen that from my angle a hundred and ... they're not\nGoing to I'm soft and legally ridiculous assumption that is not gonna happen you mail a check them you're never going to see this money and then you're not the shot if you're going to speak to your own children over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money it's all your fault\nI mean if you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do this again is absolutely ludicrous\nYou're asking for all the trouble your cost you caused every bit of that [noise]\nYeah went fast I didn't think I didn't believe in that was going to happen that off so I guess went along with that\nWas it pretty even did you do like forty forty forty or did you was it different a one year over another year\nOr it was it was about thirty eight thirty seven and a little heavier up the and ah you see the finish line and\nYou can go ahead because the the finish line here all my fair and was getting scary\nYeah you know when you can see the line you can run harder yeah yeah very good\nCongratulations you guys very proud of yeah awesome you don't have\n...

N. T.

Madrid, Spain I'm three eleven that's why I had moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Dr Savage\nHanging and energy so what are you saying\nWhat I'm saying is this you are touching people's all live with your words you have a gift for writing and that's exactly why your books are reaching number eleven it's not like the New York times manipulating lift up the number of coming out because you're having the most emotional input\nWait a minute the book before Trump's before gone faith the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one uh one than a Lebanon eleven so white Vernon says Savage first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less\nThis rather age groups and demographics is going to be huge and it goes on from their wealth of scary you don't want to make any predictions do you\nAh well may I Will make you a prediction that when it comes down to the coin won't be proved to be a fraud\nThank you very much for saying something I Know nothing about nor I Know why even put that in there but that diminished everything you said before joining the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred seven eight five or more of a seven to eight to servers [noise]\n[noise]\nTo know why why would that matter let's say you're going to a high school where there's all slow learners or or or such and you're like number one what would that mean when you go up against kids who were number one in schools where there's tremendous competition huh that's not a standard for everyone to follow\nBecause of the ... it's going to have somebody who came from a disadvantaged background gives them an opportunity\nTo get with the disadvantaged I came from a disadvantaged background and no one reached out and gave me anything I just out of work harder to get where I Am stop but there's this advantage community there are plenty of kids that come out of ghettos and rise to the top\nBecause to have drive in that brain stop all that garbage about disadvantaged that's that's another watch more deliberate left disadvantaged what does it actually mean\nWhat does it mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\nIt it means that they don't have as many resources that parents are not as education\nOh so in other words the kid who comes from a family where the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kittens school they should be punished now\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhat you are you're saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from my house oh wait let's say there's no father which by the way is not even a racial thing anymore\nBut say there's no father at home with the single parents and let's say a there he's poor and he lives in a terrible neighborhood how do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty and yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nI I ... I realized that I'm from\nThe you know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard or you know that\n...\n... let me just explain that I've studied this in great detail that was a time the Jews were prohibited from entering Harvard that you know that\nI flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids will let them because they were so brilliant their scores were so high there was a genius was they finally let 'em in okay now we've turned it around where you're the stupidity or the higher your chances of getting in the\nYou know my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrase to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged what do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you believe in white privilege\nNo that's why that's why this would help poor white kids from Appalachia and for ... you know in other words if you're thinking you're increasing the way that you get for their relative achievement in the school but they grow up and\nYou're making a good point but how fair is that\nFine I think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish it a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond exactly\nRight so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond and then when that kid who thinks he's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called they're on those such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest is all trash\nUnless you're in a hard science is no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the others mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take the kid who was number one in the Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old how is he going to do a\nHell hell hole improve themselves at a young age rather than trying to manage and social justice what his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nDo well you're assuming you will is you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think the people who are given unfair advantage has become worse because then they expected their whole life and then he gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or Yale whatever and then when he goes for a job and then he goes into the corporate world and then what does he demand you hire me around what I'll show you you\nKnow no one has\nAnd you ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of these schools\nWho use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you at the drop of a hat everybody knows this the thing is people listening doing saying how does he there even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\n...\nWe disagree on this one I say no don't get any one special advantage either it's equal to everyone or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing as a reverse racism those words don't have any meaning either it's racist\nSo it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing as a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or it isn't racism so if you exclude Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism\nAnd you know I thank God the Asians finally sued this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight that so [noise] but no one who's Asian listen to the show they're too busy working a four\nAnd five four and seven to eight to now before I take a break\nI Can't wait for the podcast come January\nCan I tell you a bit about it we have big podcast meeting this morning I have a team of sixteen people it's ... it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work the show is going to be live this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because of the ratings are annoying Norman's ratings\nBut because we're going to be going into the cycle of the election and liberals are running some of these stations they're taking me off the air that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening [noise] okay but the rest of your old people will hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time\nAnd I expected it'll be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that\nIt will become one of the most important part Kass on the planet and if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen so one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or in the radio business\nIs that simple they can try all they want they can destroy and he's stationed in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the truth is going to set you free\nK B.

two fat disgusting\nSo called hunters both saying for the same below for the shooting between the eyes this was in the ... so these two fat gunman aim at the beach from a distance as one says the other hit it between the eyes or both of the fat ugly hunters hit one of the bowls\nAnd stumbled ... and then the ... men too fat white man in shorts turning run screaming as the the herd turns on them you'll hear you trumpet erupting from one of the elephants as the hunters becomes ...\nNow I got to tell you something I Believe in self defense thought hunting defenseless write that one um [noise] I Believe in self defense not hunting of the senseless [noise]\n\nLike off from Alameda fine I mean California Michael I have two main points to make a I'm a college admissions consulting who serves primarily Asian Americans but also a white American my first point is that\nUh basically white students actually set the standard for admissions at all the schools from Harvard to Berkeley five\nThere's actually an admissions formula for points are assigned for your grades your test scores and your accomplishments or what happens is that an Asian American when they look cute though that a score to afford missions are penalized during the process actually at points attractive on their overall score\nOne for me for being too smart correct\nA social service or it's a reverse IQ in other words Harvard's now using a reverse IQ to admit people dumber you are the better off you are\nWhat you have to understand is that true purpose of affirmative action and these quotas they're the true purpose is to make sure that\nA white liberals maintain that at least the port Iowa City but ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have have the numbers\nThen you'll reached a tipping point where white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard and they'll end up like Cal Tech and Berkeley are basically they're dominated by age not because Asians um\nHave necessarily are the best of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're in the majority and\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nThere is discrimination against their agents for that what I'm trying to say that Asians actually have the highest benchmark highest standard of all the races all of my wife there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans active points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nWell that's what came out during the the the trial now in in Cambridge the\nAdded during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during the the the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian Americans sued Harvard and found out that they are being top loaded ... against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nHigher than higher than any of the race that's a that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity but to make sure that white liberal\nDo not fall into the minority because then they would reached that tipping point right just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California white people no long no longer want to live in neighborhoods that are what predominately Asian\nSame with a college Harvard and Yale\nDamage your white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people go where the public school\nHow wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi has and fled yet\nFor because first of all she's a grandmother and second of all her kids if they go to school for grandkids I should say we'll go to private white high schools they won't know\nIn other words it doesn't apply to her\nFor Iraq\nSo what what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the missions formula has to be a done applies equally fall races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a lot of points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it is done today and we have to let\nThe ... urine and missions consultant so let's look at Harvard for example or Yale or prince and the same thing applies to all of these schools have subjects that are extremely difficult that you can't fake\nWhether it be astrophysics for organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted with these are rigged scores are able to compete in those classes\nHit the nail on the head they don't major in physics for electrical engineering\nOh so what do they will kids who are admitted under these weeks then is one of the major in the major in anything with the words studies after the was African men [laughter] ... that's funny you let me hear the studies the examples of what they major in a\n... or even environmental science which is a bogus science\nYes of course it's environmental studies which means whatever you want to make it into this not a science social studies\nGoing through a metal there is if you want to if you want to go look at bums in the street that social studies\nDon't go into a math department at Harvard for the electrical engineering apartment at MIT and what do you see it's all Asia but white people don't want to go there anymore\n... wait a minute they said well Asians because whites can't get in because they're not smart enough or they don't even apply\nWhy they're intimidated they get one or the and what what are they intimidated by\nYou know exactly what I'm Talking about the Terminator by seeing so many hardworking Asians and they sit there and they think oh my God I'm not going to be able to fly through college I'm going to go and major in something easier and usually the cop\nOut you're actually saying the white kids are afraid to go to Harvard now\nOr the yes they are for certain majors I of course they're never going to have any trouble majoring in history right as long as they follow the party line\nI don't know where you're coming from actually you're starting to be will do me now I don't quite know what you're saying on one hand you're saying that the admissions are rigged against whites and Asians and then you're saying that whites are cowardly and don't even want to apply\nWhat I'm saying like oh is that there are academic get a ... academic ghettos for Asians or guess what the STEM fields fields where they dominated by the the lesser students go away towards away from them because\nThose are you you're not implying that there are no you're not implying that there are white students can't make it an electrical engineering or are you\nNot at all not at all I'm I'm implying that there are many fewer or because they are as many of them are in ... by the\nSo where where there's a white kid will stray apply if he wants to go into electrical electrical engineering where we apply\nIt applied MIT they can apply to Cal Tech for even Berkeley right foot\nAnd they and they don't have the same skewed admissions policies\nWell they can get in based on a formula but they're not to ... for their race\nOh you mean ... actually the one of the worst examples\nOf course they are they they set the standard for everyone I they they plan\nTo to say they set the standard for racism now Harvard that's the new that's the new distinction\nCorrect they they uh they penalized Asians and everyone else followed them because again they didn't want to reach the tipping point for the student body because majority age when that happens that all the white liberals are going to leave and where do they go from there\nI I have a PHD from UC Berkeley and I remember what was going on with so many Asians because they are good students they study are they come from families that push them very hard for the whole tiger mother thing their background has won a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing growing you know what I said if people I don't\nOn a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing growing you know what I say to people I don't care if it's a hundred percent Asian it wouldn't matter to me if they all got an based on brains it wouldn't matter to me at all\nAnd so said Reagan back when he was governor of California for basically go to Berkeley saying what do you see you see hardly any white students correct\nI haven't been there and twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay\nYeah I Know I ... I basically never go to the East Bay I have nothing drawing you there it's kind of sad I used to love Berkley I won't go there it's heartbreaking to go there the last I went there it looked like a males drum up insanity of all they do is ride on the campus I mean there was no reason for me to go there\nSo you're saying that the the world has shifted so dramatically but isn't this um lawsuit going to straighten things out a little bit\nWell it depends you and I both know that it's probably going to vie for the court system for many years and of course Harvard and all the uh didn't leave a paper trail and they were they were given carte blanche to do this by the hockey decision back in Nineteen Seventy eight where you could use race as a factor\nLong have explicit quota but didn't they didn't write the quota down they just put it in their heads and say okay every time we got an Asian students and tracked points every time we have a black Hispanic Native American in your opinion\nThat has a society benefitted benefitted from affirmative action\nNot at all because when you look at for example at the top universities the the under represented minorities have a much lower graduation rate than the white from the Asia and they don't and\nWhat about the lawsuits against the university I as anyone calculated what percentage come from which race\nFive yes of course it's been calculated for example the acceptance race by race so the acceptance race race a race by race a white people with the exact same standard as an Asian have tripled acceptance rate of an an Asian students for\n... for example and a a Spanish student conversely have tripled the acceptance rate of a white students with the exact same statistic for\nIt's a terrible situation when you're a young person who's working hard to be knocked out because of the way you you look in your race it's horrible\nAnd I see and it's the opposite of what our U.S Constitution and bill of rights permits more specifically in violates proposition two oh nine which state law but of course in a lawless state propositions don't mean anything unless they advance the Marxist agenda\nUniversity of California did to the to get around it but they did is they hired more blacks and Hispanics admissions officers readers for during the admissions process and those admissions officers were obviously more sympathetic towards blacks Hispanics ...\nAre you yourself Asian or Caucasian or what\nI Am an agent who attended uh Berkeley and Ivy League schools as well wow\nSo you know with hard work is weren't driven by your parents to succeed\nYes I was and so where are all of my family and relatives\n[laughter] 'cause I was I I mean ... either we made it all you can ...\nSo we can go underwater down to about six feet for up to an hour so perfect for reading by the pool or in the tub they can do paper white which was last updated in twenty Fifteen is also lighter and thinner than the previous model so it'll be easier to carry around\nOn board you'll find ... gigabytes of storage another model offering thirty two gigabytes ample room for an entire library books magazines\nAnd comics connect to pair of Bluetooth headphones and you can even enjoy audible audio books Amazon promises the battery on board will last six weeks that\nBased on a half hour breeding every day and an adjustable lights you can read indoors and out the devices are available for pre order now they'll ship on November seventh and they start at a hundred and thirty bucks with box on ...\nI Am a WBRC FM ... three Hartford W s and she joined in ...

security intelligence or is it was his economic not\nBeing held in Riyadh that everyone's pulling out of\n... so at least that one of the Fifteen Saudis who flew into turkey that day that to show you what missing\nHave long standing ties to the crown prince and even worked as part of a security summer military officers summer intel officers one is the governments don't have a doctor in charge of forensic ... he was the guy the broad ... the bones song\nTo the party don't of course was premeditated they plan to take them out and we hope brings up old saw I mean come on and then uh you have more heart I'll do a lot of these mood trim but\nThese trust this security lead apparently for the prince seen on video in Madrid Boston you use the old ... along we shop Eugene you\n\nWe're heading

conflict at nine fifty five in the morning on October second that's when\nA Jamal ... show he disappeared went in for this and yeah I have this conversation with my wife last night I should have gone into the Saudi ... or ... you know he's a dissident he's outspoken\nI you know desperate to get his divorce papers and then his approval to marry his new wife from the Saudi king them\nBut I mean should have known that that was a dangerous spot to go in I I'm guessing in the back of his mind or that he must have\nBut I mean they have a time stamp of this this top security agent for the crown prince they've got 'em going in at night fifty five and then they have him leaving about three and a half\nHours later [noise] plenty of time to interrogate this member a et cetera was none of this is going to happen without the express written consent that major league baseball and\nOf the crown prince there's no doubt about it there's no roads operation here they they thought they could get away with this the crown prince centers going squad and his top security guy was there for this come on\nThat strains any\nSuggestion that oh we we have no idea what happened to give me a break now as far before I go to phones on this and I got to move on on the Trump threats to close the border and use even military or a assets\nI Want to get into that here and just a second but as far as this interesting little media twist for the past couple of days we have the Washington Post and they've asserted that the Trump Administration has been pro\nActively helping the Saudi royal family come up with this ah this cover story on how to wiggle out of this whole show the mess\nAnd then the administration I'm trying to help them come up with some type of plausible deniability here uh that's the Washington Post\nBy\nCNN yes I said CNN\nIs\nSort of coming to the president's a defensive coming to the age of the president's a Washington Post they are tremendous ration cover story helping the Saudis out but CNN is offering a whole different scenario here\nWhich reflects well on\nThe White House now they're thinking of the Washington Post is that Trump and palm pay or given suggestions and\nMore importantly I give them the Saudis time to get their story straight I don't know I don't care how much time they have that this is at stake bombed they ain't getting out of the post reporting indicates that the favored narrative at this point is this interrogation that\nWent bad that uh that the Saudis are the crown prince only signed off on a questioning and interrogation not of a a murdering a an asset bath or a or this or you know and then I said this memory the head and want to\n[noise] uh which again I I just I nobody ... especially the one of the top security guys for the prince has got to take any matter like this into his own hands without being expressed consent as the prince not knowing about this so uh [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ... claim is always wants to the this is what the Saudis are are modeling apparently it was just an interrogation we didn't sign off on you know dissolving him an asset and and hacking his fingers off one by one and\nI'd I'd apparently this was capture on audio which leads us to believe that the Turkish must have had the Saudi conflict bug\nWrote the Turks or Turkish they need to release this audio I don't know why they're holding on to visit and have have U.S officials have been given the Saudi has pumped pale and the White House and top intelligence officials have we heard this audio or that's still a question\nOr to be determined now of course it would be a massive mistake for this administration to assist with a cover up or ally of this magnitude and I just don't think that's going to happen\nYou know I Know Hillary Clinton on trying to uh you know cover for the Obama administration by you know trying to sell us on that anti Muslim video as the precursor the ignition point for guys give me a break\nRaising by you know trying to sell us on that anti Muslim video as the precursor the the ignition point for guys give me a break All right uh so I don't think the Trump Administration as they got themselves into this kind of trouble here now\nThese implausible cover stories they they don't work out very well historically I I don't think it's going to happen here so the Washington Post is trying to suggest like I said that the Trump Administration trying to assist the Saudis but CNN\nThey have a different story CNN has different reporting giving assistance to the Trump Administration and again with the Washington Post is asserting CNN CNN is reporting this here's a quote\nFrom CNN quote a source familiar with Tom Perez Tuesday meeting with Saudi Arabia and crown prince Mohammed bin some on health CNN that the smiling photo op between the two should not be read as an indication that the meeting was friendly instead\nHarm pale totally been saw him on in no uncertain terms\nThat he had to own the situation and that every fact is going to get out\nAccording to the source they have who added the ... smiles between the two ended when that photo op ended\nAnd we're also hearing that the administration was not happy that that's how it was portrayed a but listen ... don't don't give the media a photo op in order to you know throw that back at it at you so here CNN is giving the administration some coverage here in\nWashington Post is not I tend to think that that reporting is accurate and the front of minutes raised was going to do the right thing on this story I uh I got to move on to other things I Want to grab a couple of phone calls first and then a\nMilitary sense of the border to stop crossings\nSummer up in arms all Mica was we got to address this so we will coming up in just a bit here let's grab some phones are eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number here on Smith eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety

just calling I'm I'm not saying that people didn't murder that guy and they probably did but I'm just saying it happened and they got a video and audio of it\nAnd how come at that pace of the mind how come nobody did now ahead of time if they weren't going to do because surely they talk about it in there\nWell the cause and there was a report out and we talked about this yesterday that the actual uh the the counsel in the the embassy or the other side of the council and that that they had a diplomat\nOr apparently allegedly told when they started to torture a show he allegedly the chief diplomat\nOr he said guys you can't do this in here\nSo I I don't think he would I don't think he was technically on board and the goon squad was sent them because they knew he was going to be there for the paperwork this was clearly ... premeditated I just don't know I don't think this was\nActively discussed inside the walls this was formulated in Saudi Arabia the goon squad was centered on two different flights and\nAh the show he met his fate inside those walls I I don't think that\nThis necessarily would have been overheard inside or if they have the place bond and it seems that they have audio how else would have gotten out the story about oh recorded on this apple watch technologically that that doesn't work you can't record on the apple watch you can control and\nI guess you can record on your iPhone obviously but you can't record on the apple watch and he left his phone with his fiance outside Margaret thanks for the call I appreciate it still is also the story last week
