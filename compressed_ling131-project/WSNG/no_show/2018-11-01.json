Whitney in General Electric ... and ... and the you know the consortium between us tech and and French technology for jet engines\nI and you know the Chinese have a a a fledgling but a budding commercial aviation program because they're trying to challenge a Boeing\nAnd you know when when I heard you know about the Chinese companies making parts for us aircraft or a Arab us or putting a factory in China or I don't know if it ever happened but Boeing talking about manufacturing\nSo for us aircraft or a Arab us uh putting a factory in China or I don't know if it ever happened but Boeing talking about manufacturing inside ... wherever you poke their an Airbus I think everybody's been open up a factory for the uh the three twenty family and jets if I'm not mistaken you know a bunch of old I've been ripped off\nIt's being stolen everything whatever's on there for them to give it and the Chinese have their own ...\nAnd you know I read about this a while ago and the ... it's kind of looks like a seven thirty seven or an Arab us ah three twenty family and let me look this up real a real quickly here because I ... I remember reading about this maybe a year ago\nThat their program is late it's the latest over budget\nAnd technologically even with the tech may stole their still behind and the plane is forest tech is is like ten or Fifteen Years out of the let me something and find the story I thought it was a fascinating story a Chinese\nChinese commercial\nJet a out dated a [noise] personal jet ouch date in the tech\nKnowledge is it a try to remember the name and it's like a C one hundred or something is also that ah that can they bombed a body ate a plane was I think Airbus has taken over as well\nUh ...\nYeah I don't know if I'm a real find a story this correctly but uh oh here it is the ... it's the scene nine Nineteen I found I read years from May of twenty Seventeen a reality check on China's seen nine one nine jetliner\nA click on this story I think this is the one I read some some time ago and how they ripped off all kinds of tech over the years but still\nIt's a it it it's ... well delayed and it's like a regional jets maybe a little smaller China's first commercial jet the ah let's see ah\nAh I think they maybe it is a\nHair this scene nine one nine certification a\nDj in a I think it's supposed to compete with the the three twenty seven thirty seven\nThis jet but the stories and I read is that still technologically this plane's going to have a hard time getting off the ground that you know as far as the commercial success because the Boeing jets and\nThe Airbus dance in the in the space that trying to compete aren't much more technologically advanced and more fuel efficient so but that the Chinese are trying to better that and how do they do that do they do it themselves no\nThey ... off that's one thing do [noise] so more arrests it's like every week now you're hearing about the Chinese stealing intellectual property and Trump has talked about it [noise] uh what can we do about I Wish we do something about it\nIt's just unbelievable we spend the money or other countries and other companies they spend just in in order an amount of money for product development researchers are Indian and the Chinese are wrapping 'em off\nSo a couple of things are on the lightning round here on ... and the final minutes of the program here on a Wednesday a Halloween Wednesday\nIt's a if when recognized for a while I was talking about this I numerous occasions not every time it pops up but I thought this was interesting Kellyanne Conway who is an advisor to President Trump\nAnd a sports person and frequently does news interviews a lot of the morning and the cable news interviews\nIn defense of the president her husband is very outspoken against President Trump on on numerous levels and that's why it's fascinating to watch Kellyanne Conway knowing that\nWhatever she said her husband back in the home is saying what the hell are you talking about you lie that's not true or the latest now\nIs George Conway the husband he's a lawyer\nAnd very plugged in governmentally on George Conway is now attacking the President Trump a story that rolls out yesterday about that executive order to end birthright citizenship\nEnjoys calling it unconstitutional Georgetown ways not only commenting he wrote an op ed\n[laughter] so once again completely opposite and saying that Trump's a idea of using an executive order to end the birthright citizenship is unconstitutional\nYeah of using an executive order that ended birthright citizenship is unconstitutional\nAnd he wrote about this he coauthored a Washington Post op ed along with a former acting us solicitor general and they're saying that an executive order ending birthright citizenship would be challenging clearly lose and again let let me be clear my position here\nI I don't like birthright citizenship for illegal I just think it's unfair and I understand what the fourteenth amendment says I don't think it's going to change anytime soon I don't think there's going to be a constitutional convention\nA Trump if he is an issue is an executive order is absolutely going to be struck down by the multiple levels of federal courts a federal court and federal appeals court it'll go to the Supreme Court it's going to lose their and I even think that that comes to some of the conservative justices and maybe even some of the justices\nThat Trump appointed might a rule against Trump\nAgain I don't like in the fourteenth amendment I don't like the fact that an illegal can bust into this country give birth to a kid while here after they broke the law coming in and that kid is automatically a citizen I've got a problem with that\nOr does it mean that the fourteenth amendment is going to change it does I don't think it will but still I have the right to believe that that's not fair and it's not right so George Conway\nThe governor's race Connecticut has a chance to elect a governor who is like a fiscally conservative because it's your money\nSocially

fourteen thousand a hundred thousand or seven thousand people that are aiming to march all the way to the American border where do you see those contradictions\nI mean don't you think that the entire open borders movement is sort of predicated on a grievance against the United states is in a phobic or racist or national extra protection against and yet people want to come in here so the obvious\nConclusion is so bad why would you just stop when you get across the border of Mexico and enjoy a similar cultures similar language and mental were\nEnvironment and you wouldn't have to go

enter the United states\nAnd then laws they continue to resolve again and that almost begs the question I mean our east Central American countries lawless because of the collective values of the population some some cases and that is if people don't see the contradiction that\nThey're breaking the law because they're angry about others breaking the law then why would they come to the United states and not assume they can continue to break the law which causes the reasons for them to leave in the first place\nYou know Don try I literally play the sound by last night that the drift Jenkins

and I think I'll go to America and see if they'll clear it up for me a ... not ... not an accusation but a conviction and and these are some of the people that are coming north and the care of

a ... in that ... in the moment you were born you are not subject completely to the jurisdiction of the United states and you are not a citizen and so that was something that as you noted as it wasn't on the fourteenth amendment Congress or years later passed\nA law granting citizenship to Native Americans or should they accepted that she should they should they're tried to be okay with that and so that was not something another fourteenth amendment and in fact something that the courts and and everybody involved the greed\nOr even though they were born in the United states the geographic United States they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states under the fourteenth amendment\nNow Amy I'm Talking to Amy swear whose legal policy analyst that heritage here's the thorny or

those were the executive order and I have all these listeners who say large you didn't like what Obama did and I said no I didn't like it when Obama\nSaid I Want to train federal immigration laws says you have to trick the DACA kids out because that's what the law said and he tries to fix the law by signing a piece of paper is though that is ... you can change the law by signing piece of paper you can't\nPresident Trump does not proposed to change the constitution or amended he does not proposed to change federal law he merely says all the way along the federal bureaucracy has recognized as

born here no matter what your circumstances you're an American citizen we're now going to change that interpretation can he do that with an executive order\nSo let let me start off by saying that it's incredibly hard to speculate because we don't have an executive order in front of us don't have the language of what he purports to do with it but that being said this is very very different from a for instance what you saw under DACA where\nThat Congress passed a law there are laws regarding at the deportation of people who are in the United states illegally and the Obama administration essentially said we don't like that we're going to prioritize so that certain individuals are not deported and also on top of that even though Congress gave us no authority to do this we're going to uh make it so that\nCertain individuals have legal status or outside of what Congress has stated that that's a lot different from a president saying look\nThere is no clear authority especially not from the Supreme Court not from Congress as to what the fourteenth amendment means with regard to the children of illegal aliens in so it would be well within his his\nConstitutional authority to save\nA instruct executive agencies who issued passports and Social Security numbers that they're going to to execute the laws in a manner that is\nConsistent with this very limited view of of who is and who is not a citizen a given that Congress hasn't really sad one way or the other and at the Supreme Court certainly has not ruled on that\nBut especially not in the last hundred and Twenty years now so it's two very different situations there um but again hard to speculate we don't actually know what this executive order might say\nWrote at least we finally get a test of this who will I mean I'm sure it'll be fairly quickly challenged by someone although do they have to wait until somebody is through harmed in the eyes of the law by the implementation of this before they're going to actually ...\nI yeah I my my guess is you you would see just like what the travel ban almost immediately\nDozens if not hundreds of lawsuits being filed asking for an injunction ... almost certainly one would be granted by some judge somewhere\nWith a nationwide injunction uh and and it would ultimately given the gravity of of the question at the serious nature of it it hits at the core of of the constitution ... there's no way this would avoid\nThe Supreme Court other than\nThey dismiss it on some sort of jurisdiction will thing um but but ultimately it\nIt's a question of Supreme Court hasn't touched for about a hundred and Twenty years and\nShowed an executive order be issued they there is a good chance at that at the executive order does anything meaningful it's going to make its way to the Supreme Court\nAnd is Ernie down your mind that the fiber originalist will vote to say we're going to go with the original meaning of the fourteenth amendment or do you think there's a question there about how the ... vote\nI think there's there's always a question when you're dealing with a medical is especially when you don't have the order in front of you um you know and and it it's always hard to speculate what I can say is that it it has heritage is position and that is the position of of\nMany originalist scholars that it is very clear based on the jurisdiction all history or sorry on on the um the legislative history\nThat the original intention what Congress intended to do with it was to give citizenship only two children who were born in the United states

but\nAre they going to do something about Google and Facebook when it comes to data privacy and use it their job to safeguard the data or to force a private company to safeguard the data of its customers or is that the job of the company in the job of the consumer to be a you know consumers aware that there is a threat out\nThere ... yeah and certainly large I think that it has to start with the consumer the consumer how to me ultimately responsible for knowing where their data is going and if you promise the Internet at all in the last couple of months you notice the results of the genie PR the general data\nProtection regulation that's from the EU but it affects websites everywhere you've seen that do you accept these cookies notices\nThat is a direct response to the European Union union laws and the question is will our Congress enact similar laws ensuring that companies often end users to collect information about them and their data privacy now I I Would argue that most listeners and\nReally even probably when you and I don't fully understand what that warning message means we click it to get to the content we're looking at we assume that every website is going to be tracking our behavior and tracking some information about the question is how much\nHow honest and open and transparent are they about that\nAnd do they give the give us as the new regulations require\nThe ability to take our information out of there and say\nI no longer trust you I no longer wanting attracting my data pleased to lead it and\nDo the company's then follow suit it's a bit of a complicated issue and it's interesting to see what if anything Congress can agree on to propose to the American people that say hey this is how we're going to protect your data but I think even before any of that happens bars it's important that we take an active role in protecting our own private do you\nSuppose that any of these ... companies like Google and Facebook\nMight say to you we understand that some of you have particular data concerns I worry about that a bit Brian because of the nature of what I Do for a living and some of the crazy people that of occasionally come after me or my family um but frankly that's been at a ebb tide for a while so I'm I'm Glad for that but there were times where it was truly frightening so\nWould they ever on for somebody like me well you're going to have access to all those but you may pay a little bit more but will agree not to\nIt's frightening so would they ever on for somebody like me well you're going to have access to all those but you may pay a little bit more but will agree not to grab your date at all because you think\nThat if they you know a private company would say let's do things that meet the needs of our consumers some of them don't care if you're gather data other people care intensely why not\nWhy not have the private company meet that need by saying yeah you can have access but if we're not getting our data we need to pay for some other way\nAnd getting our data I mean it's important to point out that the reason these companies want your data is because that's where the money is Facebook can target more effective ads you if they know a little bit of ... or in some cases a lot about you and so you're saying large you know hey I Want to pay ten bucks a month for Facebook to have a\nPrivacy or a free version of attracting free verse and if you will so that you can get all the content of faithful but to contribute to pitch in to the kitty for example you're willing to pay a monthly subscription\nAnd I think as these rules and regulations get rolled out and people have a more in depth conversation about privacy some businesses that are going to have to\nTake a look at that now that Facebook so the and the ... of the world could probably afford to have a few million users opt out of tracking with no tail but if you're a small start up and that's how you're making your money based on the data and targeting advertisement you may be looking for another option and frankly I Would welcome that if it's a service like Facebook\nThat I use and and they can provide a level of service maybe a phone number I can call when there's a problem I'd probably be happy to pay nine ten bucks a month or for something like that\nIf the value proposition with Aaron and he made it was the care\nBy the way we had a tremendous little success peace with phase I mean we've had our troubles that race was over the years but but one way to tell you this land to do a broadcast from a University of publicly supported the college Republicans said\nCome down Lars and you'll speak to our group and you do your broadcast from here and we will love we're celebrating a Second Amendment week I said I'd be happy to do it well the last minute the college shut it down because you know I carry a gun everyday although for me to do that\nIs completely legal it's within the law and the university has no power to stop me well the university than threatened the students the ... they said we'll take away your funding for your college Republican club a will will ah sanction you use students maybe drawing you know\nPulled up in front of a disciplinary committee and hearing all these things\nAnd in the past I never would have been able to do much to respond because like it or not when you do a broadcast you have to have permission to be on somebody's you know to use a room or whatever\nAnd and I plan to have you know as many kids wanted to stop buying and talk during breaks and that sort of thing well that didn't happen because the university could denied the space could denied access to the Internet connections so I said to my producer let's go up and we'll do Facebook Live stream\nFrom the campus and we did exactly that and you know that thing has had so many hits it's somewhere in the I think it's four hundred thousand plus on that piece of video where I just\nStood there and the ... on the on the campus in the student union and explain what had been done how the students were threatened how they were told you cannot invite this person to campus\nThen how they were literally threatened with disciplined as ... as individuals students that you can't do that to a young man or woman who's Nineteen or twenty say you may end your college career right here now because you invited somebody we don't like to come to the campus and it got a tremendous response from around the whole country\nWell and and let's talk about Facebook Live and some of these other tools and you know we're talking about privacy and\nHow we can pay for the how these companies can pay for these products everyone from you know think about Google mail and all of the products that they released largely for free well they're not free because they're using your data to be able to sell advertising and that Facebook Live broadcast\nWas only possible because you opted into allowing some of your data demean shared advertisements to be targeted to new\nAnd the four hundred thousand people that have needed that that piece of video so you have on our and arguably Facebook is where the audience is and for broadcasters like yourself and myself are that's where we need to be and it's great that they find a way to pay for those even if that is with our privacy\nBut he comes back to that we have to be concerned about our own privacy there's no sense and waiting for Congress to decide what if anything they're gonna do take an active role take it to that\nYep absolutely Brian thank you so much for their time\nIn about a happy Halloween That's Brian ... you\nKnow happy Halloween to you as well that is Brian Westbrook you find what he writes had Brian

some place that does say hey this is true these Lincolns are saying this is true and that Christianity is false\nAnd people are hungry\nFor this kind of certitude that ah that we're not providing them frankly\nWell maybe they're right in and saying that has become perhaps\nIn some ways more uncertain world or just from the standpoint and you tell me what you think of this doctor breaks it used to be that we got the truth from three evening newscasts\nAnd radio and your local newspaper there's usually one I'm most big cities had gone from many down to one and so you you know if you saw a story and it was the same story on the evening news on the radio and in the newspaper you thought well I Know what's going on these days with the Internet\nAnd with all the multiplicity of sources which I enjoy uh because I like being able to track well\nYou know this is one version of the story let me read for more and see if they all match\nUp and see where the differences are but that can also lead somebody and say well I don't even know what's true I sat down and write on the Internet research to particular news story or topic and and I got six different versions and they all seemed to be valid that could lead you to believe the nothing out there is certain\nI think that's true for a you know matters of news in day to day events\nAnd politics and the light but as far as religion goes here after a sort of metaphysical\nCertitude there after answering these big questions and you can go and read that there's [noise] you know differences of opinion and that's always been available for religion I think most people always understood that there were [noise]\nYou know the Hindus and ah and Mormons and the Buddhists and all this kind of thing so that was always there for people to explore if they wanted to and I think that this is probably at least in America\nOr another reason people are fleeing Christianity is that it's [noise] it seemed it seemed to them to be more conservative you know where it's sort of breaking a part of the country right now\nAt least as far as the pain is goer bifurcated\nAnd a good reason that people are leaving is that the Christianity seems to say hey look we have the universal ancient\nTruths and if you want to be a Christian you need to hold of some of these and this is becoming distasteful to a lot of people who\nDon't want to acknowledge those truth\nWell gosh you know I'll admit I have a dog in the fight 'cause I'm a Christian but Dr brings I almost get more worried that the religions that go along and get along and say\nOh you can be a Catholic and still believe in abortion you can be a Christian is still you know in other words it's it's\nIt's like ordering at a Chinese restaurant one from column a one from column B and if you don't want anything from columns say you don't have to I mean if you're looking for certitude and the church says well you don't have to believe in everything we believe in to be able to be you know a Christian or or you know or\nOr a Muslim or whatever the Muslims are pretty strong or this is the way it good you go and I understand they buy for patients to a primarily between uh\nYou know Shia and Sunni but but do you think it's the lack\nOf of religions taking a stance and saying this is what we actually stand for and if and I think\nThat's absolutely absolutely positively the largest contributing force Muslims are not a are\nIncreasing because of this reason I Know that there are some differences as you say but even those sects are increasing and not just because of a you know increased birth rate there's lots of conversions being made because uh Muslims are willing to say this is right and there it is\nOf uh you know increased birth rate there's lots

your emails at eight\nSix six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nI'll give you a little something from inside the radio business even on TALK radio you hear a certain amount of music we have what we call get back music which gets us back from the commercial break we have introductions that have music in them and we pay fees to use those pieces of music and the folks who create the music\nIf we pay the fee we can use whatever musically ones it's licensed by the major licensing agencies well you know that a lot of politicians use music as well uh you know the the you know the Clintons are identified with certain songs in ... certain songs well apparently for el Williams is not very happy that his song happy\nIs being used by President Trump for music at his rallies and he'd like to stop him I wanted to talk to Tom cooler who's an intellectual property in technology attorney Tom welcome to the program how are ya\nI'm very good laws thanks for having me\nNow I Am glad to have you and I I can tell you that this isn't the first time this has come up in regards to politicians when you hear a rock and roll band and say it says we don't like it wasn't so and so I use is our music ... been going on as long as I've been in the business but yes you know ... what do you think about the idea that that\nThat uh the musicians want to retain the right to say I don't want that music used with a particular politician that I find distasteful what do you make of that\nWell it's it's really interesting especially and divided political climate that we have now we're seeing more of this in fact\nWe saw this happen list Neil Young who was that was a Bernie Sanders supporter and his objection to the use of walking and the free will by Trump's who actually turned around and said listen if you don't want to use it that's fine and you are happy not to do do that and you turn around and said I Wish you would have asked\nMe because even in the Sanders supporter I would've allowed you to use it very interesting take there but you're like this has happened for a while and what we're seeing is a move by the artists themselves outside of the copyright license to assert what is essentially state full slight\nClaims or federal false endorsed claims under the trademark at ...\nThey are trying to say that by the use of their song in their celebrity there somehow communicating some type of sponsorship affiliation orange\nAnd it said that by the use of their song and their celebrity there somehow communicating some type of sponsorship\nAffiliation or endorsements buys them of the Kennedy that's using their music and I think that tort stemming from and so you're seeing more and more of these things happen\nIt has happened for a while John McCain ran into problems with this of course himself a syrup tailing did in ... and you said this herself even Obama rented barracuda this bad exactly\n[laughter] so so as you so\nMuch time tell me that is if they were to pay the fees and say we pay BMI and ask cap and there are two other majors that I Can't remember a we'd pay the fees will use it if we choose to you're saying that under the fold slide a you you could actually make the case it'd be it'd be like a\nI don't know if if somebody caught a picture of me standing next to a product and then they began to use that there might be a above a copyright issue but there'll be an issue of you're saying you're saying that I'm endorsing this and I haven't\nEndorsed it and you and you can't do that without my permission and and that they would be able to do that even if the politician paid the licensing fee\nYes there is a color will claim and it's under different things one is as I talked about what we kind of encompass in the right of publicity under state law in which case there's an appropriation of in this case the artist named likely\nLikeness or other value associated with it they're trance posing that to their identity with the music itself and that they can identify route from the music itself and that there were some\nTennis that that's a achieved\nThrough the use of that by the campaign and it's a color will claim of the elements for right of publicity the one that I see that it's actually a stronger\nWould be the section forty three claim all of the ... which is that ... a affiliation sponsorship or ... that's an unfair competition area of the trademark act that I've seen leveraged in cases like\nWell see I wondered about that because you know that on my on my show I've used music from time to time and they don't use that much I Would but we we we have a bunch of things called benchmark so if I'm going to talk about marijuana\nOr you know because I'm not a fan of the drug but as being legalized in various places and it causes a lot of news stories uh we have a you know one took over the line mixed into an introduction and and I I Would imagine\nThat a chances are they wouldn't object to that but Peter Paul and Mary might object to my using puff the magic dragon which I Believe is a song about pot in relation to songs about idiots doing stupid things on pots because that would also be a ... maybe it's too small change to to object to that\nBut that isn't music used that way all the time by both disc jockeys and by talk show host to\nAdd music to some subjects that may relate to it some way\nYes I mean what's happening here is is that now we start talking about um are we using this in the context of parity which is an exception or as part of the air you stop turned under copyright law are we taking that in in a different direction\nAnd you you bring up a good point with Peter Paul Mary and the use of that song in fact if I recall correctly I'm back\nIn Ronald Reagan era there was do you support Bruce Springsteen's born in the u._s._a. and it was being used as like this have you know rally nationalist anthem when in fact\nThe artist himself Bruce Springsteen was talking about that and saying you know this this really is a piece that cuts both ways is that a Vietnam vet coming back in and saying that it it may not be what you're actually using it for and so it's very very interesting that we look at the music itself I think campaign should be very very careful in\nWhat they're doing and how they're using it because I have\nNoticed myself like you watch this for a number of years I'm In my twenty fifth year of law practice and I've seen these ramp up\nOver the last ten Fifteen Years and I think we ... if I was advising the campaign I Would say\nPlay it safe reach out to these specific artist in this case for well is not even under any of the main ones ask that you might see that he's under a new one that was formed back in two thousand Thirteen or two thousand fourteen called global uh write a global music rights Annette\n... a outfit itself covers rake in others it's pretty clear that the campaign to not have a license and done not seek the permission from four out for the use of that song well it'll campaign should be careful\nBut let me ask you something how much latitude you good if you say\nI'm going to go out as a candidate whether it's president or dog catcher and I'm going to engage in free speech\nAre you allowed to say I'm I'm making some some use of this\nBut it's in consequential to the sales of it in other words you're you know people may here and say oh that's a great song I should get a copy of an Irish downloaded but it is and and I guess you could you could have some negative effects from it but does the candidate who is engaging in politics which is covered by the first amendment free\nAssembly and the rest of that does he have any latitude to use it and just say it's fair use\nI think you've got to be careful that's a that's a case by case basis let's\nSo that does he have any latitude to use it and just say it's fair use\nI think you've got to be careful it's a that's a case by case basis let's look at some of the ones that have been used Newt Gingrich using a I at the tiger from Rocky strikes John McCain's use of running on empty with Jackson for by Jackson Browne which in fact he actually settled that case it had to issue an apology um\nWe talked about Ronald Reagan in born in the usa a\nPoll lions who said we're not gonna take it which was a um there was some pushback like twisted sister and rage against the machine or a number of cases here where it seems very clear to campaign it's using the song because it's spinning Americans for the specific campaign\nRight and I think that were unique to be careful because now I I from what I can gather the way the law sits right now although you can make the appropriate defense and trying to say we're using this as free speech reasons is parity um depending on its use\nThat as a defense to an action that most certainly would likely be bought by that artist\nBecause they don't want to be seen as being affiliated with ... guy but I Know what you're seeing more you're seeing more of that with Trump\nTom one last question why we got the time ... does the artist have to show that he's here she is lost out on something as I've lost sales or are there not prove that there is some actual harm to bring the to bring the coin\nBy large he's the middle east is kind of an oxymoron and and we talk about a democracy democracy versus theocracy versus you know socialism and that's what we're talking about right now I did this to seal is Suzie Suzie sociologist I I don't really know how to call them or\nThe socialist these individuals believed\nIn a system that is just fundamentally unproven and even these iconic individuals Ben and Jerry they say they want to give away all the profits and then when it comes down to it they realize that\nYou know by by and large it's not within our human nature we we want to be successful and we want to get that and\nAnd really the actions speak louder than words and and nine line apparel we have nine foundation we build houses for veterans we are creating a community called the veterans village where we take homeless veterans off the street and we help educate them and get them into some sort of employment when I\nAsked him what I asked to Ben and Jerry's is why don't you put your profits where your mouth is instead of preaching of all these things talking about the things that should be done by someone else and saying that I'm going to donate some of my money\nOut there you know really we're talking about less than one percent of total earnings or why not put some your actions behind it put a little bit more of that that type ... doomed others as you want\nLike to be done on to you it's preached in ... obviously are folks who face a why can't we just adhere to it in the civilian practice\nI'd like to see that happen in fact I think it would have been a lot more fun and a lot more all Americans of Ben and Jerry's had come out with a [noise] I dunno some red\nTrump or you know paint Trump or ice cream and and then the the the resist stop and say just picture flavor because in America we can have all the waivers ruined and then been injured cells twice as much ice cream because they're selling your both sides I've seen\nSome other retailers sell soft drinks and cans like that and I think snapple even decided to do a red\nAnd blue version so that they're heading up to the election you could choose do you choose read or do you choose blue I thought that was much more the attitude that Americans can believe whatever they want to believe and that we don't stone people to death for their belief like happens in some countries\nAbsolutely so one of the things that I really like to see is the fact that people look at the issues at hand it's not read say it's not lose faith it's the idea that there's\nIssues that need to be discussed it if we can vote along the lines of the issues that we want to be addressed which is what happened this last election you know people were tired of\nSeeing some of the things that we held\nNear and dear to our hearts deteriorate ... and people believe that the current administration was going to make true on their promises it if we can do it alone or our belief systems and and are you know issues and get away from
