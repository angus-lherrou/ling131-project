did they get to this man so quickly what's behind that\nQuite police work great police work but the NYPD the joint terrorism task\nForce which is made up of FBI agents in NYPD in New York state troopers and the Federal Bureau of investigation and what they did\nIs they took the forensic evidence from the unexploded bombs and went through it meticulously and fringe ugly to be able to come up with in a evidence which led back to ... or say Iraq\nAs well as fingerprints on one or two of the bombs\nNow that's not always going to be possible but even want to bomb has been set off and has exploded frequently you can still get data from it ...\nYou not only do get data but you can also recreate the bomb so one of the things I mean we can we can take it from the Ramsey Yusef\nA World Trade center bombing in Nineteen Ninety three where they exploded a car and the NYPD and the FBI were able to recreate that car to the point where they came up with the Vin number from the car and the type of explosives and put it together to be able to track it back\nTo Ramzi Yousef to be able to arrest him and satisfactorily convict him where he's still serving time in federal prison\nNow let me ask you this in addition to all the physical evidence like fingerprints and DNA would say those are say acts a name naturally\nHave been to some extent on a list anyway because he had prior terrorism on his record he had ties to both Florida and New York and would you work at this as simultaneously by saying who are the best suspects that we already know may be on in the mix\nWell we don't know if they came to that of eventually they probably would have being that he was in that area the fact that as you\nProperly allude to he has deep fry or threats of ah bombings and the fact that uh he was driving round the van that would have probably eventually led to someone making the call if they didn't already\nAt what point do you I don't know if you'd be a monumental task I Would imagine but at what point do we need to start screening male or at least packages the same way that people get screened before they go on an airplane or ... or is that a ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's come out of this case and I'm surprised that they don't do it more often I Know FedEx and UPS\nDe do some kind of screening and uh try and determine what they're shipping but the U.S postal service handling billions of pieces of mail a year it may be much more of a difficult task\nBut you would think that if you're going to implement that type of procedure you would start so with packages and work your way back to potentially envelopes and or anthrax\nDetectors ... exactly what I'm thinking of and I know that I fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line in my mind here is being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the to some extent that thing is color coded it makes me think that\nMay be an automated system could at least spot some of the more obvious ones because\nI you know I Know that some of this is a closely held piece of information but I Know just by looking at the system that things\nShow up differently on that screen depending on what kind of material they're looking at are they looking at ...\nAre they looking in metal are they looking at the inside of a laptop and what is a legitimate laptop battery looked like and what his laptop battery look like and what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder I mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age\nUh we've got such good technological tools that you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages\nAnd just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria check that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIs an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that before should look at an airport when you when I go through the screener and no matter what line Iran it goes there if something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks in and out\nOf the machine and it takes it out of the conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt I don't know why we couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nYou wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know\nWe couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nSend you wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know that a computer never gets tired you know if it's scanning looking for particular characteristics\nYou'd never gets tired and never has an off day had them never has the day when you didn't get your second cup of coffee and the computers should and now I'm not saying the machines are everything but if if you need to scan hundreds of thousands of baggage is I don't know how you could do it unless you had an army of people saying they're looking at screams all day\nOr you wouldn't do it we don't do it at the airport well we do is we have a screener who is alerted by a computer\nScreen that there's something that calls for secondary screening it with this package\nAnd that's where it kicks it out so if you're a package was delayed by my package was delayed by a day or so I wouldn't mind if it needs a secondary screening and therefore was put into separate line and had to then be done by a human or even the second machine tools\nTo its third point where a human that looks at it because I think that the safety of our postal employees and the people who are delivering the mail and people where it's going into a male rule in certain buildings around\nThis country you know the safety of our people in our citizens are paramount to law enforcement as well as everyone else in this country\nNicely said now tell me that is what else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law enforcement can come upon someone who's looking to do us harm and how quickly law enforcement agencies around this country this happened to be kudos to him why pay the the FBI\nAnd the joy terrorists task force and the postal inspectors but you know it it shows with law enforcement around this country and we're cops do every single day and every single jurisdiction to keep our people safe\nAnd how quickly they'll find you if you plan to do an act of terrorism in this country and threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction the police will get you they will arrest you and you will spend the rest of your life in jail\nSay Iraq is now looking at fifty eight years with just the five charges they've charged with today I think they'll add additional charges other things are failed\nIt will be a life sentence either way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years is a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it if not the death penalty\n... one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know and I know you're not you know in the position of the crime lab is do you think he intended for any of that used to go on for nearly to have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nThe way that conservatives have behaved so you're asking\nFor something that goes way outside of our usual behavior I mean\nMost of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and in D.C on television\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example of January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration the crazy women's more ...\nYou know the fact is there's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally an equitable okay it's already in the law does exactly what I Would you like we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV\nI think that's what's crazy\nAll the last ... or Madonna telling telling us Elizabeth Trump and that's not wacko\nShe is often has sized or dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko\nIs well and yet you know that\nIf a Republican had said this very same words and the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna's says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's ... there's a really strong double standard and done I I Love journalism\nI've been in it a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day I'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become\nBecause we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off and the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories is that when I went\nFrom being a reporter on television or radio to being a talk show host\nAnd the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories is that when I went\nFrom being a reporter on television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers in people I knew who say\nYou're a conservative and I said yeah I'm a conservative they as well I never knew that and I said what did you think I was why you worked on television I thought you were a liberal and I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do\nThe other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession is if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them and a double standard\nIn other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar there is nearly identical we're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one endless Fox on it one was CNN on a big big screen TVs and I and\nI look at them and I see them saying with no prove Donald Trump says X or y or Z\nAnd I thought during the entire eight years of Obama I never once saw them say\nWith no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the but there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when ... when it when bronco Obama was asked Juno that the IRS has been going out and denying\nAs conservative groups free speech rights by denying their applications for tax free status all he had no clue and he said oh the first I knew about it was one I saw it on the news and I thought that was a bold faced lie you can't make us you can't\nTell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet\nAnd then turn around and say no I was completely clueless as ... and I made the point is the president of the United states should be arguably one of the best informed people on the planet he has\nPlatoon of people around him from all these different agencies whose entire job is to gather every important piece of data in the world even stuff that that secret and\nThen to boil it down to just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran and we're going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him\nAnd say this is what you need to know how could a guy who's so well informed claim to be so ignorant of what was going on in the only answer is he was lying and yet I never saw CNN\nOr MSNBC or any of the rest of those jokers or the New York times say the president claimed without any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on in the D. O. J. during fast and furious or the IRS during a the the cheating on conservative groups he had no idea that the EPA was out taking actions\nThat would lead to release of toxic contaminants into the Animas River he had a you know the words according to Morocco bomb a bronco bomber was arguably the single most clueless president in American history if you believed his denial of that\nThat's what's going on in any case at least the man is in custody he has been charged with crimes\nThat give convicted will put him away Caesar say they'll put him away for the rest of his natural life\nWe've got lots of talk about on the first amendment friday night eight six six four three nine five to seven seven you are listening to the Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking power swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strips are trays that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred six seven nine o nine six night\nYour bright white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free one eight hundred six seven nine o nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nMutual insurance knows your focusing on the road right now so we'll just describe our new billboards to you they're horizontal rectangles with the yellow background the headline reads liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need ... and while that might sound like a lot of words for a billboard they all fit\nPerfectly overall it's pretty great advertisements go to liberty mutual dot com for a customized quote and you could save\nA man and\nCovered his underwritten by listening to all insurance company ... when many senior characterizes there's no place like home ... never had to give up\nThe coverage is under written by living to insurance company with illegal housing ... when the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home\nYour loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting angels will provide home care for your mom or dad at home I'm twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework you'll selective professional caregivers with visiting angel look up visiting ... dot com or call eight seven seven three seven four in less\nThan eight seven seven three seven four men franchises are available visiting angel America's Choice in senior home care\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the\nFirst steps to recovery to help you need to be one call the weigh eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the recall now eight hundred three nine zero Ninety five to eight your addiction team is a third party advertiser for various treatment centers and play some networks individual results will dairy visit your edition team dot com forward slash Kearns for more information [noise]\nMm hey ...

bought a brand new question each and every day at Lars Larson dot com that's our website ... at Lars Larson joined Twitter\nShould President Trump be held partially responsible for the bombs absolutely not my answer to that has no if you choose to answer yes the only thing I'd like to know is does that mean that each and every time that a president is critical of people from the opposition party\nCritical of the media as Donald Trump has been\nCritical of democratic politicians and critical of a lot of Republican politicians as well I might remind you that one of the unique things about Donald Trump is it while you didn't hear Brock Obama criticized people from his own party very much at all in fact I Can't think of a very good\nExample where Morocco Obama ... or Bill Clinton\nA or Jimmy Carter or any of the other Democrats who have served as president of the United states\nChose to criticize their own party\nBut I Do see them you know criticized the opposition party Donald Trump criticizes anyone that he disagrees with that as far as I'm concerned that's a good feature in a president\nOr Twitter bowl should President Trump held partially responsible to the bombs you know my answer you can give yours at Lars Larson joined Twitter it's raunchy you buy a Mac\nYou've served our nation as a person\nTo humanitarian assistance\nWhere the mission takes us

and the ad council ...\nNa na na\nNa na\nI'm Lars why shouldn't show it's\nA pleasure to be with you and I'm Glad to take your phone calls and emails on this First Amendment friday night but I also want to talk to my friend Dr Henry Miller and you know him as a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute\nPublished in a lot of places both scholarly journals that are way beyond my ability to read and the popular press as well Dr Miller welcome back good to be with your Lars\nSo we've got a lot of other threats in this world obviously today we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but would you mind talking about the fact that we see continued average to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things we had done that it's actually made our lives we take it for granted but it's made our line's a whole lot safer from a lot of the threats that human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escaped from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about it go fundamentalists attacks on plastics uh I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate or and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and she was that his\nGraduation party and I'm a guy comes up to him and says ah then I have one word for you turn around and Brits\nAnd uh and and the half century since then\nPlastics have really revolutionized are so many industries uh and uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and\nIt was such a remarkable improvement they store better they keep better they're safer because inevitably\nGlass bottles would would be dropped\nA and the ... glass on the floor in which you would never get up and people would get caught and and so on a but medical devices or electronics all sorts of things a plan sticks had been really a revolution\nAnd yet the activists continue to attack it a Earth Day in April of this year\nWas a devoted to ending plastic pollution quote unquote and um we continue to have a a tax on various plaster size or things that make plastics pliable at ... and more convenient or like this you know a BPA\nUm and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with without much basis um and without thinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well\nYou know there's food safety but I buy my food in tin cans what a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which have very little ten in them are actually lined with as you said BPA\nAnd other kinds of things that make a tin can a whole lot more save for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store\nAnd and and and the plastics you know dark I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of food products are package\nSometimes dramatically sealed and you know the air and taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last longer and or is or is better better protected against the kind of common contamination they could literally take your life or a few decades ago so\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up a of a broader point which is that\nYou have to have to do with the risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment you'll have to ask if you if you eliminate a product day what are your substitute for what are you left with\nA and so we're seeing that in California because there's a\nA a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants\nTell us ... because there's a a a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants for takeout and for a for hot beverages or cold averages and uh\nIt seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course is paper a which is um lower or consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact\nThat they say well there's a ... I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both insulated and kept the juice worried belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill\nAnd when I went on research in a long time ago I had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that degrade\nAnd they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are in my own or\nDo you are absolutely right that the the other thing is that the police the Iranian\nUh generates less waste water and also occupies less space and landfill or the other thing is that we have we now have bacteria that will degrade\nA Styrofoam and and other plastics in the landfill so you know this that these objections these attempts to band things\nOr just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology but equal fundamentalists\nHey I Want to ask you about something else because about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we were talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he said he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it\nAnd we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia or we're seeing a stuffed come through that it's that marijuana gets shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship and I asked him\nWe had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag\nWith computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that go through they know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid liquid or possibly explosive you know I don't know what color explosive comes up as ... I Would imagine\nI haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said\nIf you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of a package is the postal service carries could we do that and could we say to a computer when a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray\nYou know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside and and let somebody else take a closer look at it\nThat's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\n... it it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass along a in fact it's my understanding that checked\nBaggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on the conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangest doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office get scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it [noise]\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters a could probably sail through and and maybe do it just for packages that's a good idea laws\nI just it just struck me that if that's within our grass\nI but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket so we can kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria or the ... it's on the exterior of it is it is and to a cure all\n... ... people freak out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack is often would you know will\nTrigger the bears to act aggressively here\nYou get out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack is often would you know will trigger the bears to act aggressively\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia and the purple part of the state around Richmond isn't don't you try and keep them confined up there\nAnd try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know a ... on a board member from a jails to try to get you know arts catch\nAnd release program to complete it at our local jail but you know aside from those nuts um yeah we we are short a few nuts in this town and a and across for Virginia and the mid Atlantic is is seeing this\nQuite a bit of what they are in the are coming to the side of the road\n... ... maybe more hunting do you suppose that's a positive I mean you get ...

Virginia born and raised right I I mean I was born in the bustling metropolis the masses\nRight and my dad live down near Charlottesville and then put it in a county um I've seen a huge change since ... since you know I was a kid and yeah I was in the military went around the world but what I'm saying is that it seems that and I know this\nIt sounds like almost there's no common sense coalition left it's almost like there's this progressive and I made up the word ...\nWhere people saying that the ... I Can't I have always feared government or even being in it and and supporting the constitution limited government has always been sort of where I'm always err on the side of liberty and when I see now is is that people seem to just want somebody to take care of them in a sort of scary\nThat that American Dream or that that individual is that we all think is part of the fabric\nOf our country the DNA of our constitution it seems that some people now saying that the government is there to help them or protect them and I think the government is usually there just to sort of um enforce equal misery amongst the populace and so I I'm just trying to get this liberty name back this liberty same back\nInto this campaign but also back into the commonwealth 'cause it's it's when I was born and raised I Love this I Love this place Larson meadows I'm an optimist I Can't help it\nAnd I want to see you do well see I'm One of those ...

natural\nIs not a group of people who were directed by government they're individuals I mean for most of the history of human beings on this planet we've been self directed people and occasionally we organize into towns and villages or or larger communities like states and counties but but we do that\nTo you know to to say well we need some things done that can really be best done by a government agency and it's tougher individuals' run in jail or a police force or or a military and thanks for your service but\nFor those very same people who want things to be natural but the natural order of

I went out and voted the other day early voting hours go out and vote it's just a habit I'll I'll I'll always vote I voted before I was ever a talk show host you always went out and voted\nDad made sure when you got to be Eighteen he's grown up the newspaper everybody goes and vote she live in this house there were two rules you didn't tell you who to vote for he'd give you his ideas of who he thinks you should vote for but you had\nTo vote no choice you lived in his house you voted and when you were sixteen you've got your drivers permit to get your licence and you did not wait those are the two things you could say wow I really don't you know couldn't be you know\nSay no we don't know that wasn't happening in my family maybe my sisters but not my brother and I we wanted our licenses ASAP and so we were happy for that role at Eighteen it was like a okay but we had we had to vote so\nThat was built inside of me I really don't understand the mentality which is why when we've talked so much about independence this week we've got into arguments when people say well don't people don't react that way you don't know I don't know what we're saying is it's a possibility\nAnd when we say it's a possibility I've been getting the reaction back no it's an absolute that nobody would react\nThat way well you don't know that and that's why all these advertisements are going on because the politicians don't know that and so that's why they put out all these particular ads I don't know what it's like I don't know how to find somebody who only I'm undecided I don't\nAnd so that's why they put out all these particular ads I don't know what it's like I don't know how to find somebody who only\nI'm undecided I don't know if I'm going to vote yet I might vote I might not open I'm undecided and all this massive advertising\nThat is hounded my way I don't know what gets that person off their bus as an undecided independent to go out and vote if they're still undecided at this point because I think about it anybody listening right now\nIs it very hard to imagine yourself as an independent not sure where you're going to vote in this election\nRight [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah this late in the process I don't know this this seems like one of those appeals especially using the words crazy Democrat\n... rates of that almost desperate to peel or Hail Mary and it's it could be too little too late but you do it anyway\nBecause you believe that there's no risk in use\n... ... why is this what she decided to using that desperate attempt because it's more than just Republicans that this was I guess my point it's more than just Republicans are calling Democrats crazy that sticking\nIt's the fact that ... even if\nThey don't hear Republicans saying those crazy Democrats the appearance of Democrats\nIn the media is giving them this opinion for a Democrat ...\n... in a political ad for the Senate of the United states call her own party and I know people will say well she was in Poland and it was the actor no that's her doing it that's her ad she approves she is ... she was saying they were crazy through\n... actor for a senator and in ... senator to say that means that sticking that\nIs a worry right now right with Democrats not just in the mid ... because it's not going away anytime soon but even if they get the house they still don't have the power\nI'm not sure that I Would even here I guess depends on if the race were different with Joe Manchin if his race were different in terms of the numbers that were neck and neck if he would use that\nI don't know that he would use that but we've heard the the idea before ... ... over in the house side to him right you know trying to challenge or Nancy\nPelosi a you know back in the day but the fact that ... what were they saying the identity politics but it's it's that's that's gone from this that\nIt's not about you know trying to ... it's interesting because identity politics almost sounds like an old phrase right [laughter]\nIt full on crazy [laughter]\nThat's that's so rainy Seventeen you because you have to go straight to what people are saying and how do you connect with people in their own language [noise] ... that's the difference is is what the people are clearly telling\nThe McCaskill campaign and the feedback their internal are seeing that phrase used repeatedly\n[noise] and that's why it was used in the ad\nAnd that's why it was our audio cut of the the week and I I burst out laughing when I saw the Claire McCaskill yesterday called for civility in the debate we need civility civility what do you mean you're calling your own party crazy [laughter]\nExactly how much do you really mean it if we look we can understand we understand in politics you calling the opposition party crazy throw your calling your own party a crazy\nA while just they're crazy racism in [laughter] in and she really is who you're talking about being in the middle well she's a middle of a rock and a hard place that's where she's in the middle because you've ... she had\nTo vote on the Capitol I think right I mean that action is there and it's lasting it's reason enough at least and will be up through the election to make an impact and\nThe behavior they're remember\nThey weren't referring to crazy Democrats the protestors on the street no you know this was the party they were talking about the party and we pointed that out during the Kavanaugh confirmation process you're not talking about fringe of protestors on the street you're talking about people that were sitting\nOn the committee these are these are leaders of\nParty ... and we were talking in reference to due process and present from the innocence this wasn't the radical protestors out

you talk about a click made headline of this is ...\nLine pro by addicts are mostly useless and can actually hurt you talk about a click bait headlines [noise] uh this is a story that is highly and accurately reported a steady based on a mirror Fifteen volunteers\nResearchers that the Weitzman Institute in Israel gave probiotics to the volunteers and lo and behold they discovered that only in some of them the the probiotics actually\nAppear in their stool samples\nAnd as a result of that they claim that provide acts are useless\nAnd this is something that we've long noted is that\nWhen you do is to test on somebody taking certain ... sometimes the robotics don't appear in the stool suggesting that they don't take root they don't colonized a however the researchers themselves readily admits relying on fecal samples\nAs an indicator what goes on in the gut is inaccurate and wrong and I'm quoting the researchers themselves never was a journalist saw fit to publish the headline probiotics are mostly useless based on this study\nAnd here's this study that came out just a couple of days ago actually just yesterday out of Georgetown University medical center headline probiotic use may reduce antibiotic prescriptions plant here's what the researchers found\n[noise] used to provide access linked to reduce need for antibiotic treatment and infants and children\nIt's in the European journal public health\nAnd the study found that when the results from twelve studies were pulled together\nInfants and children were kept this twenty nine percent less likely to have been prescribe antibiotics if they received pro by addicts as a daily health supplements I'll take that any day but then they refine their analysis\nAnd they repeated it they looked at what they term only the highest quality studies\nAnd then this percentage increase to\nFifty three percent reduction in the need for antibiotics such a spectacular result the findings are very intriguing the researchers say quote given this finding potentially one way to reduce the use of antibiotics is to use pro by onyx\nOn a regular basis\nThis according to the lead a steady and that's the gator Daniel ... he's the Georgetown University school of medicine and are they going to say we already have evidence that consuming probiotics reduces the incidence ... verity of certain types of common acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nAnd more studies are needed in all ages particularly in the elderly to see if sustained provide accuses connected to an overall reduction antibiotic prescriptions if so this could potentially have a huge impact\nOn the use of ... and general medicine and consumers in general this according to Sarah king from Cambridge University who also participated in this study so what's going on here so the provide X hits purported\nTo not work when you take a ... and the provided doesn't show\nUp and you're still sample so is it useless then will the answer is that doesn't necessarily mean it's useless and I've got to say that I myself have dabbled in checking my own stool samples using the various services that are available\nAnd mostly what I found was disappointing is I on a daily basis take up robotic doctor here as robotic which contains lactobacillus I've taken many other robotics and consistently I find that I have zero lactobacillus in mice tool in\nMany by patients as similar find it so what's going on with that does that mean provide acts are not working they're not taking sort of like spreading seeds in the Sahara Desert it's an act of utility because the soil is not conducive to their growth\nSo does that mean that they're used as well the answer is no because probiotics may work in a different way and some people because there's something called bacterial cross talk bacteria in the intestinal tract\nInteract with our immune system a large part of it which resides in what are called the tires patches in our large intestine from these players patches\nAre actually receptors for information from the bacteria that populate\nAnd these players patches\nAre actually receptors for information from the bacteria that populate our intestinal tracks or micro biome\nAnd if you have a healthy microbiomes you have healthy beneficial cross talk and if you have an unhealthy micro biome was bad bacteria at a lack of good bacteria your immune system gets the wrong signals\nAnd so based on this idea of cross talk it certainly is plausible but even if I had to buy the stone implanted and grow in your intestinal tracts they're doing something more over\n... may be responsible for the synthesis of beneficial compounds\nVitamins nutrients that are essential for the functioning of the immune system and for the bodily functioning generally

nutrition he's been a longtime products\nFormula later and high level advisor for purity products Dr ... welcome aboard\nMark ... speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was very pro phenomenon those people out there who just the vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty helped journals a weekend every one of them seemed to have an article about\nFirst of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically raspberry troll as what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even bounding peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants by plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... was first isolated from red wine\nIt was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well and this is one got all those scientists interested in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well by two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex\nAnd here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet in mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet this was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show\nThat resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved in ...\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading\nThat an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually\nSlows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent well whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction\nYour body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coat dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this which done by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the Cape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal\nStudies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well and this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just back from ... been working with beauty products for several years under co Q. formulas but now the teacher co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as residents role especially for your heart health and you'll see some ways it's got even more evidence behind it so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or want to co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nWell it's very interesting it combined some really amazing nutrients specifically co enzyme Q. ten and resveratrol\nAnd a number of other nutrients we'll talk about later that support your health and energy and that's the bottom line\nYou're looking at what we call the advantage of combining the very nutrient that create your body's energy co Q. ten with the benefits of resveratrol the energy stamina that comes with it and it's an unbeatable combination that gives you this advantage this cardiovascular system benefit\nBenefits to your brain cognitive performance you scan aerobics\nThe combination that gives you this advantage this cardiovascular system benefit benefits to your brain cognitive performance your skin aerobic capacity and supports normal ends of magic activity throughout the body it's just an amazing combination and that's why we call it the advantage\nDoes your person you know I Love the fact that in the new coke Cuba's ... super formula for purity products you combined the co Q. ten with was Vera troll\nNow there was supposed to key molecule found in red wine which they're studying at Harvard and I know that the ... genes for those are just to to talk to us about all the excitement surrounding ... and why you specifically wanted him this formula\nWell let me tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food then you're eating right now by a certain percentage\nIncreases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we called on longevity genes they get switched on day help improve metabolism\nIt increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt\nIn fact this gene helps increased tissue repair and it switched on by a group of genes called short too and now they found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol\nAt least in their animal studies and this is exactly why ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially use any traditional compound like resveratrol ... actively target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that's the person you say that took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented and so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin the Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight the University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana\nStock comb University in Sweden the great study\nRecently at the University of ... and ... on mitochondrial energy and co Q. ten University of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti off some articles published constantly throughout the world the archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the\nProceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies energetic\nMitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy\nCombine that with

vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D then pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one billion people\nWorldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine while I mean that's a lot of people\nAnd we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day but I think a bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well well vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that\nAnd a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health I mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula the co Q. super boosts formula

placebo when they concluded that the official doesn't do anything for diabetics ... wants to see you about the study of ...\n[noise] well [noise]\nAh oh I could just say so many things about that which is for one thing olive oil is not totally benign it has a benefits so you're comparing to a placebo that provide the benefits so I Would have designed it with some other oil but the other thing is\nIf it's one capsule then it's not a dose that's adequate to raise to any kind of target level the EPA da level in in in almost any case that we could mentioned there are exceptions there are capsule that have a thousand milligrams\nOf either just EPA or some combination or close to that even eight hundred milligrams but\nIn most cases are as you know a capsule fish oil is going to be\nFive hundred milligrams of the active the EPA Andy ha or less it could be as low as a hundred milligrams it can be a thoughtful looked at like Krohn be even less than a hundred milligrams so it wasn't enough\nIt that that does was not in keeping with the body of evidence that talks about reduced risk of vascular death or reduced risk of vascular risk factors\nSo you know a low dose and a placebo that gives the benefit is not a way to design study\nExactly you know what we're certainly on the same page when it comes to breaking down that study\nBut let's talk about the reduced to trial which was touted by a hammer in pharmaceuticals there's a big boost for its new lucrative drug Vesey but which by the way is going to retail for about I think somebody like three hundred eighty one

question for you I have a Ninety picked up one fifty that um I've got a really bad migration of my gas pedal\nWill come like when I come from a stop 'em and they go in or I apply the gas and then it goes away one path like sixty sixty five miles an hour or ... and it turns off\nI like thirty five miles an hour come back like fifty and\nBut it's like really really hard vibration\n... when when you say a vibration Tim I'm like running off for like running over a rough road kind of a feeling\nYeah that's exactly what if you're like oh like the bumps on the side of the road if you're running over those\nAnd you're not you don't feel it to the dashboard you don't feel it through the floor or just specifically the gas pedal\nOn the side of the road if you're running over those\nRight and you're not you don't feel it through the dashboard you don't feel it through the floorboards just specifically the gas pedal\nAs just strictly the gas pedal and then when I come off the gas I can rest of my foot without crossing the gas\nAnd I won't feel it but then as soon as I put my foot to press the gas pedal down again I feel it I bought it through a couple a mechanic shop nobody can figure it out a couple of guys told me what they thought it was but then I've gone and fixed it myself and ah I Can't I I don't know what to do any more I\nI mean how long has this been going on\nUp all the truck about six months ago the guy said that when I bought the truck and he thought it was\nA tire bound to because he had put new tires on it um when he noticed that started happening but I got I got the higher balance that I thought it was and it didn't work\nI'll tell you that I'll tell you the stupid thing I think it might be but I might be wrong I I Would I Would want to know what the you joined sort of like in the dry shift\nThat's what I checked also yeah we're just reading forums but when I went under there to legal to drive the drive line it had no playing it at all take it that a lot for your whole\nPulled a shift them pull to shell out pull the shaft down and feel the joy you know on the front one or the back on a um [noise] I think the rear one ... joins on the rear one would want to be what I Will go in juggle because it's it's got to have good clean movement in all directions\nAnd and I you know [noise] I've seen this it sounds crazy but\nAs a matter of fact as a matter of fact to resurrect the imagery of a carpenter Bob's eighty four eighty three Fifteen van which only went to the junk yard a year and a half ago with five hundred thousand miles on it All right well uh I remember back when it had\nWhen it was a child at two hundred thousand miles\nAnd we had a similar problem where we had a vibration and the gas pedal and we went round and round and round and pulled the dry shift out and sure enough\nA bike and I kind of let Bob work on her for about a week because you know he was he wants to play mechanic and then finally said well you have to well 'cause hey listen when I'm working on what he never tells me what to do right away kind of it's a it's an it's an equal torture that's the love affairs\nAnd I I had to pull the dry shift out in the front joint just had a little bit of a click in it and sure enough it just it it it was catching it just right creating a vibration through the drive train but you know could be a friend who we are joined I've seen it I've seen it both combinations\nObviously we're going to talk about you know the exhaust hanging right or the ... correct a you know anything that can cause are transmitted vibration from the engine to the gas pedal\nBut uh you know that should be a cable linkage set up so I'm thinking it's an isolation through the floor pan is it strictly the gas pedal or is it may be also in the area surrounding the gas pedal\n[noise] the only place I've ever felt it was the gas pedal woman again I guess I'm not yet said as soon as I come off the accelerator goes away goes away\nYeah right it's it's it's kinda hard you'd have to take your left foot and shove it under the gas pedal all you're holding down with the rates are is you know it's it's and it gets a little awkward you don't want to do that Ernie Ernie crowded streets but\nYeah I wouldn't be thinking something Dr ... and then when when you're looking at the shift make sure you know look at it how rusty is you know we're in the northeast you're in Florida you know we're in the north you're in the south or we have this thing up here called snow and salt and corrosion and then they throw all these chemicals that\nAre on I don't I don't know what that is\nTo say I know it's you know it's God Bless you and you know we um you know we have these things were waits fall off of dry shifts over time and you know you don't stop to think about it and then you get into the truck and go why is there a fresh Ross spot there\nAnd the rest of the ship is a darker rust colored 'cause it used to be something welded to that and it fell off a ha so you know getting the dry chef check for ... straight sometimes isn't the bed worst idea either get a check for ... straight and ...\nYou know if it's some it's it's actually gotten to the point and a lot of people don't understand me for there's a lot of people don't understand me for a lot of things but\nI I don't do your joints in house anymore not nearly as much as I used to and it's not that we can't do them I don't think we can do them right\nBecause I think if when you're doing you universal joins if you're not having the chef check for straightened balance I think you're only doing half the job I think it's like doing that will change with just changing a filter um you know ... unless you know you had your joints put in a month ago and and one of the joints went bad and the you know it was a warranty thing and you have to put a\nSo I said well let's just you know do I have a bad fit okay I I hooked up and set up a ground that hot feed right to the fan itself bypassed everything fan doesn't run\nOkay I I hooked up and set up a ground that hot feed right to the fan itself bypassed everything fan doesn't run a I grabbed the fan blade and I hear clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk there's a wobble the fans wobbling on shift I said gee I Wonder you know a bad spot on the armature the cars been sitting for a year and a half\nRight rush spots I mean it's been sitting for a year and a half I moved to fend just may be an eighth of an inch rotation just to change the contact point of the brush against the commentator I let the car warm up again well actually what I did was I took my power set up a power grab\nAnd I got the fan motor run noisy as all get out pop pop pop pop pop pop pop up but it started to spend it sound like a World War one by plane I was looking for new pie in the red beret and\nSure enough I Hope the backup I let the car I start to run and get warm I got to Georgia seven degrees you know Finn alright I Need a fan motor this is really weird\nAnd then I thought about it and as I was cleaning up last night carpenter Bob came in and this is the last job of the day this car was on his car all afternoon yesterday\nGovernor Bob came in and I'm cleaning up and I'm wiping my tools and he says what are you doing because he's got this Honda in front of them running\nAnd I've got this my my test headlight I couldn't live without my tests that late right I've got my headset plugged into the fan connector where it gets energized by the ... and I said well I said this is kind of like back to the future I said when this thing has two hundred and seven degrees or or higher than one Ninety nine according to the wiring diagram headlights should lighter\nThan Bob Said well where does it take the temperature reading 'cause I was explaining to them how I was seeing to seven to await and still no fan run ... and I thought about it and I said you know the switches in the bottom of the ...\nThe temperature sensor that I'm reading is located in the ... head of the top of the engine it's two different areas it's not taking it both from the radio or temp\nI Wonder if and then I realized Honda's or two hundred and twelve when I Do it I'd alert on a Honda icy temperatures up to two hundred and twelve degrees before the fan comes on I felt like Maxwell smart missed it by that much right needed five more degrees\nSo wait until the card turned to five more degrees I wait until it got up to two hundred and twelve fence which read one Ninety nine so when the ... and the two twelve the radiators at one Ninety nine that's a temperature differential temperature differential\nThe headlight came up Bob goes by the headline on well let's go to the fans bed and he just looked at me and I explained the whole thing too\nSo sometimes you got to go the really the long way around the board but the point becomes test everything I tested everything in that fan circuit I knew how everything worked when I was done I tested every component Monday it's getting a fan and the car will be done three problems none of them related the only common denominator that I can figure as\nSome of it had may have something to do with the fact that the car set for a year and a half but you know there's no way I can control that fix the problems in front of you\nIf you if you've ever wondered is this part of that part take the part of the car wired up on the bench treated like a standalone device how would you test it if you didn't have the car in front of me\nThat's how I approach everything and that's how you got to approach

couple of connective checks on abs Manjoo but other than that I haven't taken to having to take it through the next step so I wanted to get your input to the possibilities of um of what could be happening\nUm let me let me ask you this the the would you say two three five and two three seven yeah OK does this phenomena work\nSpeed is spin around and it works or wherever there is a boat or ... percent differential\nRight yeah that's what I thought you were gone so yeah\nAnd the thing the the truck does not it has it has been abs sensors and we'd have sensors on the front of their drum on the banks that there's no real sensors which\nKind of if you look at those codes they report their rear wheel ... cold or a matrix\nWell because if you look at those codes what they're what they're looking at is they're tying their time I'm a a vehicle speed through those so there you know vehicle speed needs to be accurate in order for this system to work properly\nOr if if if if I recall so the question becomes before I tried to tackle a BS how do we get this phenomena or to read accurately\nBecause they have to think about it the computer's gonna see think of it like this they there's think there's three speed sensors in this vehicle right\nAnd I sort of think there is one in the rear differential but I think it's mounted on the housing but I could be wrong and it depends upon the option codes and if you're a candidate of the you know all bets are off because anything could go that way that yeah I I've just seen strange things go to Canada versus the U.S and\nYou know so let's just deal with what we know you've got three speed sensors let's agree on that you've got a ... century we're right front speed censoring you've got something in the trends right\nIs there is there is is be censoring the training so they're not on their rear end no\nRight okay so so the two front speed sensors are reporting their mileage right but the trend is reporting something different\nTo the gate the computer is looking at that and scratching it said in the saying wait a minute it's somebody's lying and that's likely while you're getting the two thirty five and the two thirty seven so before I met you before I went too far I figure out how do I how do I program this to you know get everything to read correctly\nYou know the ... are you using a tune or of any kind\nI have a great friend of mine he has a it each peak tutors stock we're a platform\nUm we haven't been to that stage yet but we're going to get plugged in and then we'll see if we can address if it's possible uh depending on his version of software or to uh to eliminate that differential\nRight you know 'cause I I sort of thing that's where you're at and if it turns out that his can't do it takes a look at the stuff from super chips super tips dot com\nAnd take a look at take a look at their tune as I've used them in the past I use them on my two thousand they plow trucks worked really well um they give you a lot of options they do a lot of custom toning they'll they'll talk to you on the phone good tech support and obviously you can find them on line is super chips dot com but you know I think that's I think that's where you're at\nA you know that that's got to be accurate and then you've also got to be able to program in and take into account that you change a tire size at all\nUm years ago or a size as well it it didn't ... it has not changed but it's different than it was from the motor that I was the motive transmission I pulled motor transmission of Silverado right or that it had a different terrorists are even\nAs as as long as the tutor gives you the ability to account for tier ... regardless of where they came from\nWe just we just we just went through a debacle one of the neighborhood shops around us was putting a super charge or on a Ford F. one fifty one of the big yellow it we called it the tonka trucks\n'cause it looked like a kid tonka trucks and uh they went round and round and round and we had to do some programming for them and they brought it over they wanted us to put the stock Ford flash back in it\nAnd you know in doing so I noticed that after I did the Ford flash\nThen they gave me their their tutor and I think it was an HP tuner as a matter of fact and the HP tutor kept saying that you know even though the truck had thirty five is on it the tutor was programming and setting it up for thirty two and I kept saying you know we're sitting this code for tort calculation\nAnd tire size is going to affect gear ratio and your ratio is obviously going to affect you know toward calculation and I I think this is your problem they ended up taking it down to a tuna in South Jersey was able to reprogram the whole thing and it turned out that yeah the tire side differential was the issue\nSo you know you got to look at the whole thing engineers you know calculate and do the\nAnd it turned out that yeah the tire so differential what the issue so you know you got to look at the whole thing engineers you know calculate and do things the whole you know you gotta look at everything it's like an old school hot rod\nRight looted during that we've got to learn everything gear ratio tire size living with the camp um everything affects everything and now we're going to look at electronically so just make sure whatever software using gives you that option I'm\nThere and you're you're you're you're correct over that's that's the starting point right there and I think I think that's where the the issue rise right in and around the nation don't\nReally I I I Believe so I think you know this but I'm just not accurate I'm ... and\nYou know that's not a bad vehicle wait until you get it to something ten years ... oh my gosh you drive by wire and the whole night it's it it drives a truck nuts at the ... by any appreciable amount\nChanging tire size and and you know all the other things that affect it uh you know I've seen and and I'm Amazed at the performance after market has\n[noise] I don't know if its guts or nerve but the ability they just they start they sell these kids and then they have all these problems and I watch\nSome of the issues they have a you know where they and they don't have the tech support for the better companies do the the some of the others don't and I think technology is going to be the um it's gonna be the end game or the middle of the corporate for some of these performance company 'cause I just can't keep up with a technology\nUm you know beam me up Scotty it's a day with the technology is

BMW that jazz is a three point O. F. I. S. U.

I Know start later I'm thinking okay the dad who was draining Mike as a an electrical problem I could give an alternate or um my research says it could have been a bad start and I looked at the research on that about twelve hundred dollars should be a W\nAnd I'm a ... captured set for an hour as able to start or you get a so after a long period of time trying to find a problem I discovered that the car and has been on it so they did a a\nEngine I'm wrong cable you'd say rated cable um\nAnd if you're in the mid west or if you're in any area where you just saw the other girls to live\nIt corroded away yeah I yeah I can remember last\nNaval expose it could be a ... yeah yeah so um and I'm sure enough a day after doing my research or an ... to ... to be on the part was uh about fifty dollars a unique editing stock so\nThat told me since it's an old car are older are that are probably a common problem well putting out on a local car parts store and they were able to give me a insulated\nUh engine ground wire um yeah for about I think it was about seven dollars right and it took me about forty five minutes to replace the old part of\nIt was a third ... Thirteen millimeter both I Believe there's two of them uh you'd have to remove the are covered under the car\nAnd it's right there you know that it's gather to read\nAnd write a nine was very angry and once I replaced that uh there was absolutely no problem which started in the vehicle so it wasn't an alternate or she was ... was a dream issue at our ground there was about an hour of my time in a box dollars yeah\nIt's it's it's it's it's it's power and ground listen I had I had a customer oh gosh got to be five six years ago with a with a Nissan wouldn't start and cold weather fuel pump wouldn't turn on you had a broken\nI had I had a customer oh gosh got to be five six years ago\nWith the with the Nissan wouldn't start and cold weather fuel pump wouldn't turn on you had a broken ground water coming off the transmission to the engine uh uh to the main cross memory was losing ground from the engine to the uh to the to the body of the vehicle was a bread wire sort of similar situation held on by one braid\nAs you know six seven year old Nissan customers and believe me or we put the ground strap on the car fixed the car lost the customers because he was so annoyed that he went somewhere else and I don't feel ... and um you know why didn't you come to us first like it was my fault so but it happens it happens so yeah I'm\nIn the other thing I think that uh people need to be aware is that when these\nGrand cables grows it could actually cause overcharging and could hurt other parts of the ... oh yeah oh yeah and I would really ... I Would really recommend for anybody that you experienced in those two to check the ground issued grown people first\nAnd ideally go further to say this should be a maintenance item so I really think that in a hundred thousand miles I mean ... or if you're experiencing anything like it or even if you you're not you ought to be checked in ... it's such an image of a replacement\nWell and and I agree with you and I think I think part of this comes back to the ... I think the better repair shops in vehicles are coming up for service in maintenance\nAfter two three whatever we want to say ... years old it becomes part of a regular voltage dropped ground test and
