was from the the gateway pundits and you know I just I've kind of shied away from the gateway pundit over the years in the uh\nThe sense that they've they've had a couple of things just drastically

mean this is a former boyfriend now granted sometimes relationships you know he said he said of course just like this whole capital cases bought a there's\nA picture that's emerging even stronger that

guilty until proven innocent that is a very very for girls said\nThat what I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be something that you may not be guilty or was it very very very difficult time Donald\nTrump as usual has zeroed in on the one issue in this entire controversy even for Americans who don't pay much attention to what goes on to the Supreme Court\nWhich I think it's foolish because what happens at the Supreme Court has an effect right down to ground level it affects your church it affects your work it affects your community it affects the way the laws are applied to American citizens and non citizens if you're not paying attention\nOkay I get it some Americans can't be bothered\nBut the one issue that will resonate all the way down to the grassroots is this one\nThink about the man or woman in ... in your life and this at some point will probably applied to women as well as men in this case with Brett Kavanaugh it applies to men in particular\nAnd as the president said said to be to be accused of something and you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent\nAppears to be the new standard push by one side of the political aisle Republicans aren't backing that standard but Democrats are saying if you're accused\nYour accuser will be believed and you will be just believed and as Chris Coons the senator we played the

were in a terrible spot today where a man and it primarily applies to men although you could easily see the same kind of scandal involving women but that a man who's accused and if he's accused he's guilty until he proved himself innocent\nThat's been the just the Kavanaugh investigation from the beginning of this which you'll remember I'll point out started at what was supposed to have been the end of all of the hearings into confirming him as a Supreme Court justice\nFrank after he joins me now who's founder and president of the center for security policy and Frank is a little outside of what we usually talk about here\nBut uh but I Want to know do we know which FBI's investigating Kavanaugh is this the corrupt one that had to have a ... a number of people like call me and McCabe and others fired or is this one that can actually turn around\nA a good solid investigation and quiet some of these Democrats protests\nWell I don't think anything's gonna stylistic democratic process because this isn't about his record this is about uh what he would do on the porch yeah\nThey're determined to wedge political warfare against until they destroy it ended I of course at the state of the court outlook lawyers I I don't know the answer that question I I think it's a tremendously important one and we\nHave a reason to believe that the guys who would be doing the investigation of the charges would be\nYou know drawn from the large ranks of patriotic law\nEnforcing and law abiding FBI agents the trouble is that\nI'm quite certain that there are among the ranks of the leadership of the FBI still people liked in the caves and like the Kobe's unlikely pages and destruction bakers and so on and those people may or may not\nBe able to do much at this point a to corrupt\nWhat comes out of the field investigations the background investigation but I think\nWe have to take it as a gift and they'll do whatever they can because this is part of the counter state is not just deep stake truthfully it's like counter state and day or as embedded in is determined to\nDefeat Donald Trump and his presidency is any of those Democrats on the Judiciary Committee or elsewhere in the Senate or for that matter\nYou know the the the resist and anti foot tapes I'm afraid\nHere's what I'm thinking about Frank because one of the questions of because we have this press corps that is just dead set against Trump\nWhat they never considered is that we have three branches of government you know judicial legislative and executive\nThe judicial is you know they were considering capping off of that the legislative branch\nBecause of the insistence of Jeff Flake has said we want the executive branch the FBI which is under the executive branch to investigate this even though\nThe legislative branch has its own resources to do this I I Know that people maybe haven't thought of this but the Senate Judiciary committee has a huge staff\nOf people who are professional investigators and who have the expertise to do the very same thing\nThat the FBI is doing except I Wonder whether the Democrats no we've got some deep stayed friends over in the FBI who as you said are still there and they're still willing to carry water Forrest I won't produce the result we won instead of the result they might get from the left\nIts own investigators who are perfectly capable of looking into this because all the FBI is doing right now for the most part\nIs interviewing people and asking questions well there are people on the Senate Judiciary committee staff who could be doing that too and it would be directly under the control of Congress although it would be under the control of a Republican Congress\nRight well that's the rub isn't it [noise] you know I had an interesting conversation today was assaulted by those jak cash\n... who you were in Denver I chose a you interviewed back when he published a book about TWA eight hundred\nWish exposed what the corruption of the FBI and the CIA during the Clinton Administration meant in terms of essentially covering up what actually happened\nTaking down that flight of accidentally ah but ah with devastating effect and you put into the mix\nUm I think the well the\nManipulation and abuse of a couple of other investigations Oklahoma City being one yep\nI'm of course the Clinton\nHillary Clinton's emails scandal thing another and and this most recent one were still celebrating barking I should say the anniversary of in this week and that is the Las Vegas shooting I think all of these have been instances where\nPeople in leadership in the FBI did the repeal late and and co opt the work of that organization which is needed by our country um and unfortunately has damaged the reputation of the whole enterprise as a result of what these guys have done so I think that was operating for some Democrats it's kind of amazing\nToday that uh that was it a concern to Republicans given what we've been watching play out here while\nI was just one of those scandals of the most recent one Hillary's\nAnd think about this Frank I mean I think this is relevant they missed the pulse nightclub and I won't even have the whole is 'cause I'm doing this for memory they missed on medical is cruise Parkland, Florida\nThe up probably high you know I understand there are good people who work there I Know some people who work at the FBI the lower ranks in the age and ranks either took that agency as an agency even at the local field office in say Florida has screwed up and we've seen these screw ups and we've documented\nNumber of these screw ups where we've watched in real time as their screw up led to literally dead bodies in American cities and then we say but we can trust them to do a competent job of investigating something that seems\nWell the the longer that that goes on since last week since last Thursday the more we seem to be seeing this story fall apart\nA Julie sweat story is falling apart Debbie ... story is falling apart and even a a Christine Cooke story is falling apart and yet still forward we've got an agency that has occasionally produced a you know bad\nResults or no result for political results doing the investigation\nOr you know human I've talked about this a lot over the years bars but\nOne other piece of this which again I think is a function of bad leadership has been um the fact that lots of these agents good people most of them I Would argue it stipulate that virtually all of them are good people the field level people but they've been denied training\nAbout the nature of the enemy that we're facing a specifically the says Sharif Supreme assists that's been for both since Bob Mueller a demand now most closely associated with this a witch hunt against President Trump but\nWe'll recall before was the director of the FBI and he said we're not going to have people training in a way that would offend or Islam or Muslim and so these are the kinds of issues that have caused people that I admired greatly if Fela particularly I'm sure you know Chris feral yup\nOf judicial watches said listen we need to start over you know they have suggest using the U.S marshals office says the sort of\nA nucleus of a new Federal Bureau of investigations but to basically a rip this went up by the roots and start over and I'm a great believer that we need the capability but we may need a do over\nYeah I think we do less than a minute Frank the comment on the attempt apparently to assassinate a James Mattis today\nI haven't heard about it\nTo the wrong let anything about it at all and below full of rice and sent to the Pentagon address to general matters so uh you know I mean we're in a strange time and and I and\nAnd he could get a second pick I mean of Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court for some reason the next two years that would give Trump not just this pick the pick of judge Kavanaugh but another pet gun top that would set the court\nRussian I Believe to say we're going to follow the constitution or for the next forty years or so given the age of the current justices if they do if the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh by the end of this week two things are going to happen\nOne cabinet I won't be seated too there isn't enough time to pick a replacement and run them through the vetting process and a lot of Republican voters will look at the cave in by the Republicans and say\nI may not show up in November to vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not to an end we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both and if that happens that America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on\nThen we have a court that will follow the constitution instead of following ideology and I think the Republicans\nAre voters or a head of the mid term election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word\nBy saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do and that will reflect in their votes in November So ... we really are at a big divide right now if Kavanaugh gets on gets in great things are going to\nHappen if he does not I think America but we ... we may lose the Republican Congress and Donald Trump won't get another thing done for the next two years and they will set themselves the Democrats will set themselves up well for twenty twenty\nLook what's been starting to me a lot regard that as a Democrat that seems like they they pick and\nIs what part of that they want to follow up that they don't want to follow them by the way around it or by the way to reword it is that you're there as we all have no immigration bill as open border\nAnd there'll be a systematic disarming ended up that that it's rare that\nI think you're absolutely right and and and and consider that that not only do the Democrats invent invite a oh boy we just got word cliff I'd mentioned to Frank ... the James Mattis at the Pentagon received a letter didn't go all the way to him but they intercepted as contending rice and\nAh I just my producers just solar made the we just got word that Trump also received a letter had they confirmed that there was rice and are they saying just white powder at this point\nTed Ted Cruz's office got a letter was or two letters with white powder and apparently President Trump's office also received a letter with white powder in it which is designed to at least frightening and terrorize\nA if not actually do damage will have to\nFind out what the white powder is but I wanted to work that in\nBut think about what's going to happen\nIf if we go this direction we want people on the court who will follow the constitution the Democrats actually invent things that were never in the constitution for example it might surprise people to know that that privacy is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution\nBut there had been Supreme Court decisions that have been AAA did privacy end of the constitution marriage is not mentioned by the constitution so now we have a famous Supreme Court decision recently they had found a right to marriage and a right to gay marriage in the constitution if the Democrats\nAre allowed to gain control and put people on the court who would say we can invent things that are not in the constitution and if the Congress won't pass a law will get the Supreme Court to effectively write a law then a lot of your rights are going to go way\nOr the I don't think they realize as a fact\nYou know what I lost her cell phone and I'm Sorry for that cliff let's go to Dave Dave we're ... we're tied to the break but what's on your mind tonight\nOr Republicans do that and I I right there at the corner in the world of hurt 'em I just want Trump to do the same promises the law\nI'm really worried at all these illegal immigrants are raised in the health care costs they talked to this other friend of mine and he thinks a lot of my premiums or shoot

SAY Media columnist from the hill and host of what America is thinking on a hill TV Joe welcome to the program\nFliers I think this is my first time on with you correct\nI it is your first time on and and you're very welcome to be here we rely on the hill a lot you folks do a fairly good job unfairly down the middle on like a few other publications on line that I might mention like the ... and the New York times\nUh yeah that makes us an anomaly at this point which is kinda scary right but I I appreciate it I'm Glad that check there but I say but\nYeah we'll we'll just imagine Joe what'd you God is you have the potential to talk to both sides and that's twice as bigger group is just talking to one side I mean if you're if you're somebody who's in the media business don't you want to sell the both sides of the aisle including Republican or you know\nThe low forehead a Neanderthal types like me as well as the elite elite\nTypes who read the New York times over there are there ... there are a lot to say\nOh well if I'm a journalism perspective ah our stories are shared the most by Republicans and Democrats you know most of the time when you were talking about members of Congress so\nYou know a lot of members of Congress will just share you know if you're conservative Breitbart or Fox News or ... a link from there or whatever but and then Democrats obviously will do MSNBC CNN and so on\nBut a ... with us we we could share the most from both sides that's could become a business perspective ... exactly a great point which is yeah wouldn't get make more money at a wider audience a bigger net so yeah or editorial page goes left and right which is fine we we have opinions from both sides\nAnd that are are reporting a straight down the middle and that that's the way everybody should should do about their business but uh it's certainly an anomaly and then the exception rather than the rule\nIt also seems odd to that in\nThe coverage of judge Kavanaugh usually reporters are a bit skeptical about just about everything especially claims that you know you can't\nProve absolutely and and yet I've seen a lot of skepticism go right out the window that\nIf it's a if it's Christian Ford making the allegation it must be true after all she says this was done to her thirty six years ago even though she can't remember a lot of the details or as judge Kavanaugh\nHe's just a big heavy drinking loud who was apparently involved in a legit rape parties at one point that also stayed secret for the last third of a century you find out believable don't you\nI mean I I think this is one of the worst moments army has had a lot of bad moments political maybe I'm Talking about specifically a and ever since the president took office obviously going to two thousand six team but I Can't remember it being as bad\nAs we're seeing it now and I always just kind of put it to this question if this was a Democratic president who nominated a ... for the nomination for the Supreme Court\nWould we see even the Christine forward story getting any legs whatsoever because to your point doesn't know what had happened where it happened how she got home or she's contradict yourself on a couple of occasions in terms of I'm too afraid to fly I Can't testify in this day and it turns out that\nYou know she flies a lot I mean it was a little thing that you could say well that's just a little thing big deal but\nHey I mean that goes to credibility and then the stories that we have today Lars like Brett Kavanaugh was involved in a bar fight a veil and Nineteen eighty five and he threw I said somebody I mean well for starters he's a genius because when you think about it the weapon destroys itself right I mean it's\nLike an ice bullet well and the ...\nDing ding kids in college who drink beer on Friday nights and sometimes get into either ice fights or food fights is probably not that difficult is it\nTime one of them [laughter] I just confessed on Twitter that I started a massive flood fight at Boston College my uh my freshman year I wasn't going Arizona Emerson College in Boston but I was visiting some friends that I did start one that is true and yes a later at my senior year I did pour a picture of beer\nOver another friend at a free beer festival type of thing and yet I mean this is what you do it's ... used this is all part of it but I think now\nThe goalposts moved so much on this that it seems that Democrats and and partisans in the media seemed to be making the argument that if Brett Kavanaugh lied about how much he drank in college than he that disqualifies him for the Supreme Court okay\nSo that means that Beto O'Rourke who is running for the Senate in taxes against Ted Cruz Jim who had a DUI\nAnd reportedly left the scene of that accent or when he was Nineteen and college\nWrote a paper about the the ... and and ... of of women of actresses a play that means he's just qualified and then I can go right down the list of Ninety eight percent of of the of the Senate and Congress where people will be disqualified based on the new rules\nThat are being presented it is a dangerous precedent that we're seeing and I think that's why people are so invested bars in in ... getting confirmed not because he's a conservative and you want to have another conservative on the court and gay in terms of ideology it's about principle that if you allow\nThese tactics to work here they no sane person a will ever go into public service and be you'll never ever be able to get somebody uh approved onset of Supreme Court again because you could go back and find the one thing from their past and not even have a corroborated\nOr any evidence around it and that'll be enough to dismiss that person and destroy their life in the process that's why people are selling desperate 'cause they know what the stakes are here and it's scary\nI'm Talking to a Joe ... who's a media columnist for the hill and Joe I thought I'd share that this was just made for you as a media columnist to get a question like this from my see CNN and you know chicken noodle news network talking to the wonderful crazy Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nHe feel that that is in any way disqualifying for somewhat attendant Supreme Court\nBy the way he's a visiting that cases the eyes fight\nBetween eight and ... and I gave him a ... there are a lot of allegations and I mean part of LA are about how you behave when you talk\nNow this is crazy\nYou've actually got in the media serious journalists supposedly had CNN saying does this ice thing disqualify him from the Supreme Court and Mazie Hirono quote or cooperate by saying yes this is why the we need the FBI to look into this because of allegations like an ice fight with Chris Dudley at a bar in Connecticut\nRight and and then when this investigation is wrapped up and it's being reported tonight the wall Street Journal that this could very easily be done by tomorrow morning this FBI investigation because again there there you can investigate something where you don't know what time or a place where the\nUh the bar the event happened or no one can corroborate it so they interviewed a couple of people and they got through that will present their findings to the Senate and the and of course the Democratic side will leak out those findings friends I can guarantee you that ah but yeah and then and then uh that senator from Hawaii will then say you\nKnow obviously this was a rushed FBI investigation we needed something larger and scope and throwing them never be satisfied with this but this boat has to happen soon because the ... of the world and I call them ... because he is like a ... really where he has no talented you see him on TV Everywhere\nSays something else will come out that will be completely and totally unfounded just\nTo muddy the waters more an even if Kavanaugh gets confirmed ... by the way the Democrats have one here they won the dirtiest way possible but but they've painted the GOP now as anti me to anti woman and it's just such a shame that that people actually believe\nAny of these allegations when you consider there is not a skin killer of evidence around all three of them particularly the ... and yet he continue to get airtime because no one wants to challenge him on basic facts\nThis is what makes your column well worth reading all the time and I just I've been telling my\nAudience I've been having fun with this as well because it is kind of absurd it's like all the writers from Saturday Night live left out so now and you can tell and they all went to work as staffers on Capitol Hill but I've been telling them\nDo you want your son your brother your father your husband to be subject to this kind of as the president framed it today you are guilty until you prove\nAs a really small and large uh\nDown in city in it on\nA by all the way down from ... drivers to ... to students uh to ordinary people in the streets and this has been going on for quite some time now and the best\nChange in the best revolution comments when people rise up against an oppressive regime does us on the outside can only support\nSaying that you know we are with you and of course as I said a\nDoes western countries European countries who are still continuing to do business with Iran should also think twice about a continuing to do business with\nA country that has such a great human rights violations not because I say so because it's all been documented or an amnesty reports and buy a\nThose people who watch and monitor\n... nations across them go\nSee because that's the part where he'll ... perhaps the hardest for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran is a\nMajor state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of tears around the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the line or as members of the world community I mean I I'm not for global movement or anything like that but I I think that when there are potential threat to the United\nStates and when they have this kind of record with their own people end up sponsoring terrorist acts\nIn their own region which are potential threats to the United states uh when when you know if you could disruption in that region it could cause\nProblems all over the world why are the Europeans not\nClimbing on board that and saying you're right\nThese people are bad people are they just so focused these countries that want to do business with Iran on saying well but they got they got dollars because Obama gave as you said in the dollars and we'd like to sell them stuff\nYes and they've got dollars and they've got yeah so you know that relationship that I've had incest just relationship and the bottom of the mind when you think\nAbout this and that can also a nation that they don't sponsor\nTerrorism just within their own country they sponsored by Hamas and Hezbollah outside did they find a militia that outside of it on and that is why they're so dangerous so the money that's all that down he\nWent into the coffers of the ayatollah and Jim and was used to sponsor their militias abroad and to a sponsor that it isn't so uh\nYou know I I I also have this question and it just boggles the mind why are some western leaders European countries will continue to\nUh to do business with them but then as I said this is a whole other ball game you know it's about money about oil it's about a lot of money\nThat comes to the real issue here and uh you know the amount of money we're talking about people sell their souls for that so they\nThey put aside the idea that down violations taking place a when these countries are part of the human rights council they go there they know that the violation steak place because it's all a documented\nIn black and white um but I'm a accredited within the United Nations Human rights council for five years as his dad and I met\nThe victims I met the dissidents and he knows that these problems don't exist and so do the PIN leaders but uh you know this\nIs how the world works and it's unfortunate because if there was enough pressure\nThat would be a change for\nMe because you know for instance one of the conditions of leadership of membership in the ... you is that you drop\nThe death penalty domestically so all the European countries while there is support for the death penalty among the population of Western European countries the countries themselves have given up on the death penalty or and said we will not do it because you have to\nYou have to not do this show the same folks who won't have the death penalty for the most heinous crimes in their own country\nTolerate doing business with a bunch of people who have far worse than that I thought he was you said beating people to death and they're prisons and and the thing that torture Adam and you say it's wrong for us to have the death penalty because we're such good moral people but it's okay for us to do business because of the cash\nInvolved with a bunch of people who will be their own and torture their own people to death that doesn't mean that it's making me have cognitive dissonance\nTaiwan nickel isn't it and you know here I Am I met ... human rights activist I win women's rights activists but you know when is the me too movement and the women's march in terms of the women I'll see it on will play in twenty Eighteen I arrested and tortured in jail if they uncover their hair I mean\nAgain it just boggles the mind that look at the ... century we're

to be with you blind to take your calls do you want to jump into the best conversation in journalism into eight six six eight largest that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven\nEmails go to talk and Lars Larson dot com well the economy is booming America is producing energy like it never has been for and I thought it might be a good time to talk to de Carter was president of the Carter financial group and they've gone through a bitch now or never how to enjoy your life\nAnd not let your investment zone you do you welcome to the program\n... thank you very much a large I really appreciate being on where you tonight\nSo when people talk about oil and about energy and about ways to make sure that they have the money they need when they hit retirement age is that a good place for people to be above parking their money\nOr whatever it could be large it really depends on the company and what they're trying to accomplish there are a lot of smaller oil companies that are doing very very well at West Texas ... especially as if you're probably aware of the west Texas a\nCrude is probably the number one all in the world right now maybe the grant property right up there close to it but there's a lot of small companies that are\nThat really ... I Would say good investment opportunity I'm not so big on the larger companies because you really can't control what they do but if you invest in some of the smaller companies by the way you can buy stock in those things to really ... you can almost into what you're doing and what's your investments doing right now\nSo in other words if you buy an Exxon or BP or one of the larger majors you're just going to be one more little fish in that big pond but if they're buying stock in a small company did she did both ... and the ground because an awful lot of the actual wells are not drilled by the big guys are built drove by the little guys right\nThat's exactly correct to be the small companies are are are\n... leasing themselves out to the larger companies and the large companies really don't care about the little guy I always tell my clients so they'll come in and say you're Warren Buffett the great investor I'd say no one rough it's a great buyer\nBecause he can afford to buy into the axon and he can control what he does because he can buy stock to make their control but the little guy can't do that like most of my class for not that kind of investors obviously but when I tell him his will take a look at the small guys take a look at what they're doing all\nRight now we've got oil contracts really contract for some of these small\nCompanies that go out three and four years in the future because of the price of oil and the way all is being found yeah we are now the number one\nOil producer in the world is you're aware of the United states and the greater percentage of that\nIt's coming out of voice checked it out of the Permian Basin\nNow here's the question you wrote a book called how to enjoy your life and not let your investments own you find a lot of that people want their investments wind up controlling who and what they are\nAbsolutely people come into office almost every day and they're concerned about not only were they put their money but what it's doing for them and that they're having to watch that on a regular basis in fact are losing sleep over it\nBecause they're reading what the big guys saying what the stock market's doing and what some of the pundits were saying uh Ben Stein just came out with an article ... just a couple of days ago talking about three things that you gotta watch out there is going to be a bus coming up\nWith those kinda things will panic the average guy and what they end up doing is letting your investments on them they are afraid to get in and then when they get in their right to get out so the reason I wrote the book for those people as hey there's other ways to look for things there's ways to invest for ... as opposed to growth and a lot of my clients are of age\nThey're really not so concerned about making that money they made it already now they want to make sure they keep it and they have it when they get ready to retire and for as long as they live\n... ... how do you go about doing that without losing it all because I I I get worried when I see people parking all of their investments in one place one small area and and that\nSounds like a bit of what your suggestion when you say you can own enough stock in a small oil driller to actually be in control but that means you may have a lot of your your net worth\nParked in that one little company ride\nYou had as a matter of fact I don't do that I tell them up front or said you do not want to put it all in one place what you want to do is they'll diversified but you want to do the evaluation are having someone that's her professional that is involved with this thing on a day to day basis that will do the evaluations for you someone that you can trust and faith\nThere are large I've got a paycheck estates two hundred and two I quoted there's so many times that\nActually gives you ten questions you should ask your advisor\nAnd one of those questions is if I put my money into places that will provide income as opposed to growth and you'll get a good return can you provide me that kind of investments as well and obviously what you try to do is give the client the best possible return they can get\nSome of it and gross income but as they get older as you're quite aware as they get older they should really be a little bit more conservative and what they're doing and that's what we try to do here in West Texas\nWe don't mind blowing out to all companies we think that's a good opportunity for some of them but not for everyone\nBecause for an awful lot of people who've had retirement age or they're getting close to it or they're already in it they're not too concerned with buying stock and then holding it for Twenty years I mean to be honest some of them may not be around\nIn Twenty years they're already of a certain age but what they want is something that will make sure it produces a solid stream so they can pay their bills and enjoy life [noise]\nCatch exactly why I wrote the book and when I said to let your not let your investments on you I won't be my clients to enjoy what they're doing without having to worry about it I Want them to be able to go to bed at night and sleep well not worrying about the fact that the mark to come down tomorrow and it very well good just because on the situation as you are very well aware and I listen to your program a number of times\nAnd I really appreciate the advice that you gave him some others that have been on the show\nThat the market is it strange it goes up it goes down and we've been up now for a long time\n... things could really get kinky around here so I tell people all the time you really need to watch where you're going especially if you're getting close to that age where you're Seventy Seventy five after that area you might not live long enough the market goes down those for another ten years and then what do you do your income has gone you may have to go back for it can be a greeter at Wal Mart if you're not careful\nYeah well I think all of us worry about that but let me ask you this do you worry about those folks who politically seemed to hate oil with a passion\nTo you I I think it's a great fuel and no it is because I Am so much punch it there's a reason that a twenty gallon gas tank old will push you you know several hundred miles down the road and that they haven't been able to come up with something that is really the electric alternative or even the natural\nGas alternatives so I think the ... going to be around a long time unless you get a bunch of the political types like Hillary did promise to shut down every kind of fossil fuel that you could turn the off switch to and and and I'm not worried about that\n... well I we we were concerned about it from the standpoint of the politicians they try to get on the other side\nBut they're also going to lose their buttons they're going to lose a whole lot of things that the petroleum does that not all\nBased on the automobile I mean there are so many things you throw your product to produce that electric cars can do and that and the windmills out here you know we've got a window you can drive into El Paso Texas Texas\n... drive across the state and I promise you large you will always be one of these giant windmills running of the area seriously all the way and also all the way across Texas nine hundred miles you're stuck with when males\nThey produce two percent\n... percent of the sum of money to protect it to the grid there is popping up their heads will going around in circles and making nothing uh we we just laugh about that in West Texas we know what the basis for the economy is\nWe know what it will do and if they want to have it all companies that's one thing but they sure do use a lot of oil based products out there that if they if we didn't have the oil companies\nIt may not run but they couldn't button their shirt either their parents as far as that's concerned because everything's made while\nI'm Talking to de Carter who's the author most recently of it now or never had to enjoy your life and not let your investments on you that you do I don't know whether you're ... you probably do agree with me based on what you said but\nYou know the those windmills irritate me because I Know that Texas has its own little interesting scheme on electricity where it can really be sold out of the state and so there are literally been times where people have sold electricity for less than than zero where they've actually\nPay will absolutely because and if people say why would you sell something for lessons you're on the answer is because the tax\nIncentives the subsidies are attached to it make it worth selling for two dollars a a megawatt less than one what is what does it mean to a negative two dollars that is you'll pay somebody to take it off their hands or check out the motives Sally Ride is now or never the it's a pleasure to have you on the program we'll have you back some time\nThis is big stuff and Canada had only a twenty dollar limit in other words if there's about twenty dollar if you had to pay taxes tariffs that complicated customs clumps shop online in Canada from the U.S they've they've boosted that now but not to a great number but it's ... dollars and so that's twice as large so that's that's\nA that's a good thing there's a chapter on currency\nCountries are supposed to leave for a third countries Canada Mexico Warren gr yet but that say hey marker for agreements with other countries that that would be a obviously trying to play around agreement with them but other countries as well so there there's a lot of you know\nCoal has quite a quite good and positive steps or do you want me to go to the negative\nWell before we get to the negatives I Want to know you mentioned China and I want to know whether or not this is going to have a side benefit of sending a message to China that when we come to do business with them and renegotiate our deals with China because they're not involved in is\nThat that they will get a message of how the United states wants to do business\nIs that going to have the desired result\nWe all it it certainly carries that signal you're absolutely right I mean I carried a very strong signal and ... whether China will change its economic\nModel\nAt least in some respects to become more of a market oriented bottle that remains to be seen but the signal could not get clear show yes I agree with the top of your your question there's no doubt that it was what looked is to say to China but the rest of the world\nFor example talks with the Philippines are going on and some African countries and so for\nWill they take it seriously\n[noise] well China is the big question mark my predict you know better than yours odd the Chinese\nEconomy is slowing down partly because of the trade friction uh but uh for other countries pretty sure they will take it very seriously they used to the temple of this new agreement and I know it's\nYou know like a very long it's a thousand pages a lot of text and a lot of details but this is now the template for any trade agreement that the Trump Administration sides with\nAny other country and um the K. K. provision\nGlare and they they don't let them that they want to go forward they will recognize Adam so that starts with Japan were talked with Japan which of them have just gone\nWell professor now let's go to the negative what's the downside to us and to you\nOkay there's no uh it it says and I want to emphasize these are my in my ... my my metric bigger negatives on the positive but they're very small compared to the fears before\nThe agreement was you know concluded on Sunday night a closely I'm not a fan of managed trade centers that it'd be like managed\nTrade you liked disagreement show their big big heaps of managed trade and the automotive sector which don't have any impact now but the agreement is meant to go for sixteen years with a six year review and in that period of time they may very well\nRun up against these land that's also in a textiles and apparently they're more of a managed trade flavor also\nI Will try and life is that a government put kill them and between us and Canada\nIs no longer open to the companies or the other country by this agreement it might be open to countries want but they're they're not committed to and I I like competition for government for journalism to either get because they call it the lower price Ohio's a ...\nOr not a fan of managed trade either although I certainly understand why the concerns that are there that when you say we're going to let automobiles come in from places in North America Mexico and Canada or that we want to control the amount of content that's in them and that sort of thing I understand the concerns people have\nBecause if you said what's the cheapest place on earth to make automobiles it probably wouldn't be the high tax and regulation environment to the United states well before you even get to labor cause\nA well well you you might be right back to the U.S and well I Would say north of that are taken as a year is a very low cost producer hold an awful lot of vehicles large trucks pick up trucks and you\nKnow and um and media as you age for sure maybe not small automobiles I Would agree with you there are smaller combat cause but the last ... very cost competitive\nThanks to these are quite ingenious and elaborate supply chains with chronic clause North America you produce every part in a place of the most out of college\nSo it's awfully tough to do it anywhere else professor I

that's why people ... it's forming opinions\nNot knowing what the facts are or just because you have a particular narrative this is what I find more than anything\nAh where I Know that when I was in

about you Robert I'm Talking about other people that exist on their mainly on the left I see it\nBut the ignorance is even greater than just the news to read I I was when I was a when I was a bill

majority couldn't name ... uh you know a ... more than one freedom which was no dubbed the majority good name one freedom which is freedom of speech they couldn't even they couldn't even name that\nThat's more we understand how people may not know the story when that we understand is why we exist and we understand that a lotta people calls and say we learn stuff about it and so therefore we can go out and we can form our opinions and that's the way that you should do it but it goes more than just the news stories it's that after ... years and I listen\nTo multiple sources shark more

other talk radio at that time\nBut you know guests or whatever else and you know paying attention to news reading books reading the newspaper I wanted to know what's going on but it isn't the fact just let you know Robert we understand\nThat people are busy I Know some of my really good friends part of the reason I'm good friends with them is they never listen to me they really don't know\nA a ... there are so busy in their career where they really don't know them a new show what's going on like a lot of our audience does because you're really into whether you're passionate about it for many of you as a hobby which is I think it's a great hobby to have\nA ... but the fact is they're not out there promoting and opinion that's to me the problem\nThe confidence or the arrogance\nOr or you had a particular narrative in your head of what's right so you pick up bits and pieces\nAnd you ... claim that you have absolute of forty on a particular topic when after five seconds anybody in the know will tell you you don't know what you're talking about right and that's it's the air is not having the lack of knowledge on a particular area\nIs too many things for people to know there's

and say you're full of it you have no idea what's going on and that's the problem that I see people that are so confident or maybe it's arrogant\nTo believe that they know exactly what's going on and after five seconds anybody that with any critical thinking skills will say I don't have a clue well where does that come from\nThere's it's it's the citizen has greatly empowered by enact a or acting on\nInformation real information but\nThere's great risk to this country by people acting on lack of information that's the difference\nAre being ignored for whatever reason whether you just choose not to follow the news or you're too busy or whatever it is is one thing acting regardless of how it that ignorant you are on the topic\nIs the difference in today's ... ... it's not just issuing an opinion anymore on social media remember we saw last friday is why we're still talking about cabinet it is to get in your face or as they call the direct approach\nAnd the media is helping the media\nIs NBC and all of them are helping spread the lives just by giving them a forum\n[noise] you're you're there's two problems so there are people that are ignorant and willfully ignorant and wanting to form opinions based on their ignorance and then there's those in the media that understand the ignorance and understand if we lie to them and as we've said before and we talked about this last week\nBlind by omission were newspaper articles will say we didn't lie and there's not an untruth than here yeah but you left this out and you love that\nOut right which gives a completely different slant to the story and leads people in a different direction from the truth that is a lie that's lined by omission right\n\nAnd they understand as we said Jonathan Gruber set it we can lie to these people I'm sure we can lie to the stupid American public\nWill remember buzzfeed quoted claim or a disclaimer on that story they knew they couldn't verify we have no way to verify any of this we're ... we're going with it anyway that's essentially what NBC did yesterday with the the third accuser\nAs she's being called they gave her an interview when they admit it as a news organization they could not corroborate any of that and as her own story was falling apart desk and she backed out of her own story\nAnd then\nNBC nightly news decides not to run an an actual official part of the proceeding and that\nIs the woman who was brought in the prosecutor was brought in to do the questioning issued a member\nNBC ignores what's real\nAnd put on display in front of all of America or the

just getting even with him a ruined his life that's my personal opinion Brett\nSay this again now\n... or ... mother was the judge that for clothes on a ... fetch or forged parents\nAnd this is a case of revenge not sexual assault because there's too many holes in her accusations and I think this is just basically that she wanted to add revenge against Kavanaugh because what her his mother did got her parents\nAnd you know something just think how it went right up through the senatorial line on the Democratic side they should be ashamed of themselves\nNot only are Shannon shelves but I think originally there were problems she wrote two letters one saying that you cannot explain what happened and her being a a an advocate against Donald Trump they put this all together and that's my personal opinion\nBut uh when it all comes out they're going to find out it was just the case of revenge and that's my personal opinion\nOkay well thanks for the call this is the first I've heard something like this but uh I uh [laughter] you know something I've never I have never heard this kind of information\nBefore they ... it's unbelievable there trying to tell the FBI what to do\nThat

hour of seven o'clock in the morning and er another another subject that I that I hit and it's about it's about food\nAnd I will tell you I never realized never ever realized what is happening\nIn the food diet industry for different reasons I now I never thought there would be something\nIn the food field that could prevent\nDepression [noise] that's right\nA Mediterranean diet rich in vegetables fruits a fish could help lower a person's risk\nOf depression this is a brand new study that I found other research analyzed forty one studies\nOn the topic and found a link between people's diets and their chances of developing depression people who\nFollow a strict Mediterranean diet\nHad a thirty three percent lower risk of being diagnosed with depression compared to people who are least likely to follow the eating\nHabits [noise] people whose diets were high in inflammatory substances such as processed meat trans\nFats and alcohol were more likely to have\nDepressive outcomes based on their analysis\nResearchers found that several factors are causing damage to the brain\nAnd there is something that they call an oxidative stress and when I talk with the doctor or a bar sick I Am going to talk talk about that\nI read a so David ... sick unfortunately couldn't make it on but we do have somebody a a nutritionist Betty Murray coming out of the program right now\nThat's terrific that's terrific Betty thank you so much I appreciate I was looking forward to a today but but I Know that\nYou are right in the same team and this is something that I saw that I thought was was just so important to get to the product ... so thank you so much for ah for being with me here\nSo important to get to the front of a problem so thank you so much for ah for being with me here\nOh thank you for having me now let's let's start at the beginning uh this kind of this kind of a a diet if you can call it that uh this\nWill help to relieve depression is that true\nYes so it's a study that looked at forty one difference that if you're thirty two thousand different people eating and monitoring based wire and what they found is that you refer to three percent less likely have depression when you ate that type of diet\nI never realized to tell you the truth is that there was so much a depression and how that something like this could help somebody out\nAbsolutely so it's depression one of the first or second largest\nDiagnosed problem particularly in the United states where people take a daily medications and medication statistically right now how one and three so there's a lot of room for improvement and what this study shows is what we've also known is that the most powerful things can do is\nIs what you put on about at the end of the fork\nUm and this died in particular because it's anti inflammatory with lots of ... you know and the vegetables and ... and healthy fats and all of a mega three fat because the fishing the diet all the things that in the Senate choice so they help the body and more ways than one\nI never realized too light studied this that the\nThirty three percent lower risk of being diagnosed with depression\nOr know how important I've often one wanted to ask this question how important are vegetables and what are we talking about are we talking about a mixture of vegetables for\nSome vegetables are should be kind of the center center stage on your plate they're incredibly important because they have all the nutrients that ... to actually help your body recover rebuild\nReflects things from oxidative stress arresting and so the way to think about it is that supposed to be in a variety of colors says you ate a rainbow of colors a day green leafy things purple cabbage tomatoes carrots\nUm red bell peppers every single day later variety like that you're getting all the nutrition actual nutrients your body needs to operate properly um and he writes at Fort saying they're usually considered condiments or garner says rather than center stage\nAgain again there's so much that we can do for ourselves if we know what to do and and how to do it now I Want to ask you about a one one term now I Know insulin\nNo exactly but again I'm Wondering if some people would be confused with the term actually they do have stress how do you describe off she dated stretch what is that\nIs so I think the stress is is ah when you're getting into playing and\nSo it's very similar to the fact that a piece of iron outside inexpensive water and oxygen it would start to rise so and so it's actually dating so resting\nIs what happens in your body when you don't have enough ... an anti inflammatory and that gets written to crunch that fire and so we start to Iraq just like a piece of iron and that's what causes banking wrinkly gray hair [laughter] slowing down [laughter]\nBut really you know certainly no seriously I I don't know what it was a bump this fascinated me when I read it but uh this is something that really can help us and we can help ourselves with this fall and\nSo really it's it's it's ... it's a very good study showing that if you happen to have any ... any information it's good for you he eat like that that if you're one of the people that suffer with depression and particularly the medications which show about fifty one percent advocacy\nThat really may be something to do either on medication is even better better training them based diet doesn't have looked at and how the foods that same concept\nThat you might actually your condition without having to do more medication\nWell a very very a very interesting and I I Know that there are more people because I have talked to them or more are more concerned than they've ever\nInteresting and I I Know that there are more people because I have talked to them or more are more concerned than they've ever been as far as about what they eat you know if you look at some of the food that is sold\nYou know the people go in and they buy it and they I made it it it it's not good for them but they're not good at yeah you know where they're selling it but again something like this if you study it and you look at it it it can help you down the road\nAbsolutely yeah they could win and I wrote is the more money that is that marketing them you know putting me on it and the ... in the run up to the store but less likely\n[laughter] really easy way to the kind of look at it this egg is never going to spend a lot of like on a rare\nVery interesting well I'm Glad I talked with you I I Know a a doctor or a bar sick please thank him in and tell him that somewhere along the line I Will call him but now you certainly are a a brave and and the talented substitute let's put it that way\nI think\nReally respect him because they remember him when he was here as an officer in the state of of Connecticut or before the Senate and uh so some of that still still lives but ah I had\nIf you take a look at senator Blumenthal in and Murphy is no better he's trying to connect himself from Blumenthal right now but originally he the entire time he's\nBeen in the position is he's Batman representing kinetic at Connecticut has steadily\nDeclined and that's because he went after\nSmall businesses and Murphy is the same way ... will be the same way they don't understand small business even though they say they do it can't have it both ways you can have liberty and allow small businesses to grow and become ... provide ladders\nOf opportunity and it's the same time regulate them to death\nAnd and manage every aspect of what they do day in and day out Connecticut has become a hostile environment\nThe small businesses mom and pop and and that has to change though\nI Will who's who's listening to you or you just hit you just hit it right on on the head this is one of our big problems and we've got to we have got to get a change no question about it\nWhether or not this election will do it a remains remains to be seen\nBut I uh we just you know something I I I Can't\nBelieve some of the things that have gone on and uh and I tell you right now I have talked to Democrats and the Democrats some of the Democrats ... there were six of them that I talked with okay ... and\n... every one of them they said you know where Democrats\nWere proud to be Democrats but we cannot vote like this again that's what they told me and uh whether or not they're going to carry through with it or not but uh this is a ... a golden opportunity for for the state of Connecticut but whether or not the boat will get out we'll have\nTo uh have to wait and see but we've got some big problems here [laughter] [noise]\nWell I think that change would be good and Blumenthal should step down and we should\nHe's not going to study the I'm forgetting [laughter] he's not going to say well you\nKnow no one no one is getting in his face and he needs people in his face and actually he's very difficult to um ... and trapped\nIn a in a situation where he has to actually off the cuff a from his heart and mind address the public anymore because he hides all the time these senators they're such big way 'cause there's no access to them and when and they're surrounded\nBy a public relations expert that are almost like a ... they're like the security\nGuard so all of this premeditated stuff that Blumenthal came up with is really a horrible shame on our country on the judicial committee on the fact that ... it's just horrific and I do believe he should\nPaint on our country on the judicial committee on the SAT at a ... it's just horrific and I do believe he should step down\nBecause of it I think what he's done and putting these horrible women truly sweating it Chris ... you know Chris ... a Ford and and Deborah ... is a poll every nut case out\nOf every single asylum if they can find and in it for a never ending inquiry and Blumenthal behind behind it all and he should step down because of that\nWell I Would I think I'll tell you I'll tell you right now are there when you look when you look at a at Murphy a you know he uh\nI just don't understand the slipped let me just put it this way I have never been in a situation where I Can't understand something when it comes to the political apple and let me tell you you've got\nThe [laughter]\nI mean seriously I'm Serious and it's and it's uh I'm just very disappointed you know how that\nFeels I mean in in the ... when you trust somebody and then all of a sudden everything changes and you say you know where am I and ah what is going on and that is exactly what is happening now\nSo I'm Sorry Brad I've seen it for a long time because I've been very deeply I'm involved in analyzing the political spectrum\nI spent over a year looking at how a libertarians thing and the spectrum of libertarian from and our kids to\nUh you know conservative Republican or libertarians and ... it's analyzing all of a of that I saw it coming along time ago but I also know that senator

we can get the files that we can understand them and also that these\nTypes of things will not happen at the things that I'm concerned about too is ah I remember when you told me the story down where you live\nA when a or one of the persons that ah was let go and that's what it was a did some damage in that area or does it these are the things I think that we have got to start looking at\nYou know you're referring to Frank either raise arrest though who never write cold blooded yeah houses out and they'll leave store owner who who he was robbing and who peacefully gave him the money or a rush though was demanding\nAnd at point blank range shot him dead through your heart on videotape by the way it was a you know it was no question about it\nUm yes I I offered to ... I told the press yesterday at the press conference but had I not only had the data that numbers I have the names I had the names of the\nPrisoners the inmates the criminals ... cage and this file a violent behavior but\nI said to them look at if you want or give me the names of ... of the hundred and thirty six uh uh inmates have returned to a life of crime committing murder I can give you the names of the uh the hundred and eighty three that raped women after they were a left prison I'm\nSort of start just the number becomes the face a real name a and of course is or fourteen thousand we're talking about by the way Brad um\nAs I pointed out to the press yesterday mine numbers are probably really understated the reason is because I'm counting\nFor example Sergio Korea as an inmate who was in charge now we're three murders in Griswold that occurred late last year that he's ... he's on my list only once in other words because we have\nAs a prisoner who committed one of these heinous crimes but I can count to three crimes 'cause you'll see records show me all read that he committed murder so\nWe are I'm certain understanding the actual number of violent crime has been kind of because we're counting the inmate's not the crimes themselves\nWho committed these bio crimes\nUm and so and and there's other reasons too by the way the dealer seat doesn't classify a a prisoner that they put out in the community and the halfway\nHouse as someone who's discharge so there was another murder I Am aware of that's not in our our files because the the inmate wasn't classified as being discharged even though he when he was out in the community and a halfway house he'd been murdered a\nA young man over in Bristol so if anything the numbers that were touting\nAnd showing are approved for the program really don't tell the whole story the under state or the disaster that this is\nAnd you know the things we've got to do is we've got to get forced the governor\nTo focus on this and have an objective third party look at it it's not a question of whether the score is better than the preceding law\nBut it's a question of whether this law recklessly jeopardizes our communities by not reforming criminals and then letting them into the community earlier than they would have been rather than to the committee\nThere's no reason to let a hardened criminal or ... or into our community ahead of schedule when they haven't been reformed they will go through the motions Brad I've talked inmates I took the deal sea officers themselves the old telling me the system is being gain the ...\nYeah I think that some people can't be reformed and the reality is maybe\nThe Democrats or Republicans get together and talk about non violent crime like somebody doing some marijuana I don't like marijuana ... a lot of people do it and it's not um as long as they're not committing a crime by their drugs and they're not hurting anybody maybe when all those smaller share people\nOut of jail to reduce costs and make sure that people that are white for users rapists child molesters bank robbers she told you elder abuse those types of people need to stay behind bars you got to the society because they want to cut costs of all the people that are um\nBetterment for small marijuana and you can if you do that\nI think it will play so well with democratic voters as well for the Republican because it's just it's\nIt's there's no reason for some people that go to jail for many years are doing a little bit of ...

got to go to news who you got to get it over past okay\nGot it okay what's good double dipping an employee retires who has outstanding knowledge in his particular niche\nThis state hires him with no but re hire them as a consultant with no benefits and maybe a small decrease in pay and they don't hire another state employee he's the the the existing state employee retired he retain as a consultant\nWith with no benefits maybe maybe participates in a four one K. the state saves money because\nPrior to him retiring he ... he had all full benefits he retires with no benefits just gets his salary\nOr maybe a small reduced rate when is double being wrong double dipping is wrong with one of the state replaces that employee and then retains them as the console that now you've got to pay checks going to where there was one\nI worked at United Technologies late they hired many\nMany former employees the comeback consultants but they didn't hire room with any benefits and the ... small reduction in salary it's smart business because they already know the system that you know the procedures they know how to do the job\nSo not all double dip being as bad that's what I wanted the

Perdue from the great state of Georgia senator how are you\nWill or good morning I don't know what the word ... means but I think um\nBecause I'm pissed this morning I'll apologize fearless there was going on but this is a sham it's a new low in America this level of character assassination I didn't think we would see again in my lifetime but I'm disgusted with the process this week\nUh the the fact that President Trump comes out yesterday and starts talking about it a and says look this could be your father your brother's son she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the president hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case\nYou know a doctor for one of the you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leaked it and they exposed it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think ah you're exactly right I think\nIt's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAnd I knew everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake like our in the elevator and then you get these things are yelling at me it turns out the woman has a ... executive director of of this or has funded group as he said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a\nGood lawyer good plaintiff lawyer could do this or just good good litigation attorney can do this this is kind of a it's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of their\n... uh inherent civil rights and I totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep\nWhere they work until they stop being complicit this is outrageous law and it it if it doesn't do anything else that you'd served a wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing off is for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow and grow up and\nAs you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator for do ah there's so much a that it's happening a ... which is positive or in this administration the news has been a ...\n... only negative uh because ... that's just one of the media are they're not going to that right I mean we've had this NAFTA deal pass\nOkay a or B or negotiate has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this can happen they said Trump was a big of a ... a Obama ridiculed them is gonna made his way this magical on some are going to renegotiate all these deals well you know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work\nAnd and you know you don't hear nothing on this huge alone milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of a as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did\nUnder President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how one with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea this presence agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the op is talking about what's working in this or gender before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or tried to harassment or restaurant okay there's a new I tolerate that anyone in my family and my kids they they they better be they've been it'd be really ready because this is I Am not intimidated by some\nRich kid who lives at home with his parents\nOn the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your your activism on the side and I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United States Senate people who are supporting this actively encouraging and signing it we have a state representative\nThat actually was not involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people who are ... out\nOf Dr Ford or anything else these are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money bags types to counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars and built her into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nOr this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and in laying a line on them like oh Trump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this\nTight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams ... who they lost weight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's awakened the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race and George has drawn thirty million dollars from um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and sorrows and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the\nTone of the of the remarks of the initial a defense that a judge Kavanaugh gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly middle maligned\nBut then it went on and the interaction with the members was short and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was that concerning to you Kevin ... face of the old club it's your\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected ended the he was in ... and he should have been listen to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrat\nI mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again calls him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just this the tip of the spear of what are their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense one of the people need to know I'm again this was a poll by landmark pretty decent pulling out at a likely voters um\nAnd it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth economic growth and George has been very strong\nAbout what could a left wing governor due to that grows\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants to single payer and she wants to all these giveaway programs that would cause a state taxes to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had\nAnd she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way and so what's happening is all of this conversation about war on women everything else has can do the issue Georgia right now is rated the best state in the country in which to do business and she wants to tear that doubt\nWe have a great Republican candidate blind camp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little uh a little bit of an awakened awakening\nFor your complimentary

a moment we'll go to a standard ... that's ... brand of course it moving the goalposts I'm sick of that phrase everyone's using it but that is what has been done\nAnd it's been done since from the very beginning when there was a vote scheduled for Kavanaugh that Thursday to an ... two weeks ago [noise] uh they\nWanted that move for a reason they wanted more time to find more victims find more cooperation they couldn't find it after all this and after all the interviews they've done that they've they've scoured the country the Yale alumni directory the\nThe prep school at Georgetown Prep alumni directory for anyone who could be a corroborating witness to this alleged attack\nI couldn't find it no matter how they try they couldn't find it so now it's you know this is game day now this is where the rubber meets the road and there are exposed\nFor what they are by the way a more information about ah Christine Blasey Ford's a friend in Delaware a career FBI agent and likely was with her during the accusation letter construction\nUm this letter was not redacted Ford lived with Monica McLean [noise] um and during that time her boyfriends and it was my understanding that McLean\nWas interviewing for a job within the FBI and the U.S destroy us attorney's office\nI wouldn't have Dr Ford help McLean prepare for the polygraph as I told you before explaining detail what to expect in a polygraph and how polygraph worked and help McLean I become familiar with less and less nervous about\nThe exam Dr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology [noise] [noise] um and he goes on how we flew around the Hawaiian Islands together uh and [noise]\nHe ended the relationship once she he discovered that Ford was unfaithful while living in why [noise]\nUm [noise]\n... forward was continuing to charge on their credit card [noise] uh after they broke up well it's not that big a deal\nWhen confronted Dr ... Ford said she did not use the card but later admitted to the use after he threatened to involve fraud prevention I didn't speak again to Ford until after two thousand two when Ford\nContacted her brief him briefly um so\nThere you are you're listening to learning from show All right uh we have more information more news will get to all your calls coming up congressman Andy Harris was a victim of the left intimidation campaign yesterday will talk about what happened when we come back\n\nOr\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I just wanted to keep you up to date on how things are progressing so I'm getting balance of nature every month maybe sometimes twice a month for my friend who\nA again or teaching these young people that this just as the normal course of business this is just the way you interact you shout you know FU to someone\nIn their face use use screen at them and say look at me look at me if they did to Jeff Flake or and you prevent their movement or they were blocking the ice officers in Portland not so long ago for weeks and weeks people couldn't even come and go to their workplace\nSo uh you know just it just shouldn't be just shouldn't be allowed and get a good ... that's not how civil discourse ... in this country or you can you can agree or disagree with with what what ice does but the fact is there a legitimate law enforcement agency you don't like it you know\nTry to you know the time to change the law obviously that's what some of these individual doing by tempting to elect people who said either going to abolish ice\nI disagree with that but again we can have a public discussion but you don't have to get physical you don't have to threaten someone and again\nIt it it uh it's sad when you know when when a member of Congress goes out and says uh this is the way you should protest is you know getting people's faces\nConfront them uh it's not civil it's not right it's not the way I was raised and I guess some people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is acceptable in in a in a free country\nA congressman Harris are your thoughts on the overall political climate in America I Know you sit in the house of representatives but given where this Kavanaugh's confirmation saga has gone with unsubstantiated allegations most of them are falling apart now\nOf the people are finally coming out and saying whoa I Know this person should she helped to help someone to take a polygraph once clearly lied under oath if that's the case is a firsthand witness of this or old a pro bono um and it seems to me that we have a lot of people with a lot of money who are unhappy\nThat Donald Trump became president and by any means necessary they will attempt to derail his agenda but not with substance with again these types of stunts\nOh oh absolutely uh Laura ... in the media is the right front and center on this\nI'll tell you uh you know I was a physician and I watched the testimony and my comment was it was pretty clear that Dr Ford is a troubled person and I think anybody who watch the testimony a comes up to that conclusion and she admitted that she has had psychological issues\nI said that in a in a in a interview and I was accused of saying I said that she couldn't be trusted now I didn't say that but that's the that's what the media wants to portray they have an agenda and and that's\nThat's what's so different now than for Thirty years ago the agenda is so obvious and so parents are from many members of the media the president thank goodness is speaking out against it's a you know calling calling it a lot of space and uh that has that had to be done to of course he gets criticized when he goes to\nA congressman Harris thank you so much for that update you're listening to Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls\nIn a more information\nOn this ah\nMonica McLean I here we go and she was a friend of she has a friend of a Ford's a so Ford was in her home with beach Delaware on July twenty six twenty Eighteen\nAnd her lifelong friend Monica Monica McClain who worked as an attorney or a for a peel by which is I'm In the day or Jay and FBI and a robust beach Delaware\nApparently both of them are there at the same time that she wrote her a letter to Dianne Feinstein a Ford and ms McLean her best friend ... are the best friend she actually coached on lie detector testing were together for the four days leading up to the actual writing a letter\nFrom the twenty sixth of the thirtieth [noise] it would appear this is the conservative or tree house it would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson\nAt the time she wrote a letter to Feinstein ... that would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling miss Ford\nAnd how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack\nAgainst Kavanaugh who better described the Internet history and know what processes and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who are deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved in all it's\nNot only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills too says assessments forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of D. O. J. an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor a former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies ... does the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director\nUh to Andrew Andrew McCabe Michael Brown which begin now to make more sense [noise] I think about it remember the lawyer she ultimately got with brown which [noise] brown which was as Andy McCabe lawyer ... get Andy McCabe former deputy director the FBI\n[noise] [noise] and\nAt a\nFlight called McCabe before a ... day I'm rose and science gives me\nBefore they he decided to ask for that extra week and that that that doesn't really bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background [noise]\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was\nNow reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating so again if you examine whether she ... misled the\nCommittee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages all her emails to all of those that have been deleted which are recoverable and that it\nFor ... McLean anyone who is ... it was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office [noise] all of that needs to be out all of it [noise] do you agree with me that you cannot\nAllow people to get away from the get away with us excuse me [noise] same thing with Julie sweating it [noise] if you're submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that\n[noise] I don't care how long it takes would prosecute for that [noise] [noise] ... and I I bet that\nText messaging trail to Christine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down and I'd subpoena that therapists if a therapist even exists a subpoena that therapists they look there is no patient a doctor privilege here\n... she was releasing notes and showing them to\nAt least showing to the Washington Post she references them in her testimony gone no privilege [noise] [noise] [noise] a lot to uncover here so they want to go through other Brett Kavanaugh use the word drunk in a handwritten note to friends or whether he threw ice and Nineteen eighty five ... I'm not in July what happened\n[noise] ... do you what would you be curious to know that I Would I Want to know if a former FBI agent [noise] uh who has an enormous amount of institutional knowledge about how to scrub Internet history and other people in the FBI who would know how to do that\n... Dr Ford knew how to do that on her own someone helped turned this process [noise] eight five five forty Laura stay there your reaction up next\n[noise]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [noise]\nAnd [noise] please up in the free from Congress people\nLeft as going completely crazy [noise] the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\nDid you ever look at the stains and your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to tease her swamps is the five minutes solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist this is John Green the c._e._o. of\nParis robes and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking all it takes is five minutes with Paris robs in\nFive minutes you'll see an average of to shape wider cheese and in seven days six shapes its clinically proven to white natural to you as well as caps Anthony here's the secret is it to the\nChurch and that was developed by Dr Martin dinner gr loop stains off of your teeth best of all there is no matter if you strip search trees that you have to leave in your belt for an hour just rub your teeth for five minutes and you're done to Dr Paris rubs risk free call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nThat's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six though I guarantee you're right wide smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free today one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nThat's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six though\n[noise]\nWhen I was little I think talk for a long time\nThings like the same\nAnything from when I say\nI Am on our side of the same guy\nCan get in a\nName is Sarah\nI've gotten a little ...\n... ...

I I Want without funding it a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you mentioned my town hall there they seven hundred activists came from the lab swearing a pastor\n... as he gave the opening prayer at my last town hall it's all all on video people go Google it and that people just leapt door walkers were spanberger a campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter's home alone for people show up at the door looking at my windows taking pictures walking around my\nHouse to leave a piece of says ... held de ... my daughter has to retrieve half\nHour later she stayed in the house that go out thank God\nUh and then the young man that was busted a we have video of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half\nHour ... and so I you know I what do you conclude from that uh it it's not good out their their their you know ... and people at a restaurant a note due process\nOr in it it's the leftist fighting with tactics\nWe've just never seen before and especially on the fundraising and so get out there no matter where you are in this country and support to\nSupport the good conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right now there's a lot of folks\nWho are that are deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one and so all need help too but uh it just it you're right or we just need to stay on message at\n... ... ... one of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the ... there's nothing\nThat separates the mainstream voting rights or Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was ... open borders a sanctuary city is no rule of law ... and they're they're running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have a real results in this Republican\nA majority the results versus radicalism it's yeah in fact her ceilings it's information over intimidation ... results over ... over and over and over again\n... GDP is four point to write and how it's going to be over four and a half by ... it's what Kennedy a shitty but you did your Kennedy did supplies I\nBut I Will tell you David or they don't tell you this and I tell us on my Republican friends running\nNumbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with a with a medically challenged child it's about a motion so you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been\n... had been you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington and and yeah well that that's right that's what you need I mean I ... the numbers are you know that's it's great but you get people download on a on a motion to\nWith that my my opponent said don't don't look at the numbers are skinny\nResponse to that air go look at a hundred billion Walmart shopper who sales are through the roof and then at\nThe kitchen table issue right everybody's life is way better off now everybody ... thousand bucks back\nIn the pocket and it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue until they are\nThey're they're running against the good News I'm I like where we are but we we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing and messaging together and like you said we gotta type stories as Ryan people\nIs Ryan and raising money free for a raise or anything just for the a congressional campaign committee but is he right raising money in part is getting money from them\nYeah Yup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out in a a bunch of other outside groups are going to help out a thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country and uh we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not\nJust the numbers the optimism every small business I go meet with buying a new truck\nOr buying a new little piece of capital equipment they're hiring one more per se\nBut that's a huge deal most of where I live which has made the small businesses and they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need everybody out everybody now go tell your church your church your business is your sports clubs just all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward with his optimistic pro American\nPro American worker pro manufacturing base and thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way it is in the rose garden a yesterday a or was it yesterday or Monday started Monday during the NAFTA announcement said that\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very find people that are running in close races in uh may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually right and this political calculation is he is he right to put this off though in a Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our lab rich right we we let it be known that nine Senate Democrats will block guy and so right now we don't have at the beginning of the cycle or after the election our leverage will go back to a hundred percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got that fight on that one right that was one of the

phone company to cover the lines that run from my house to the street if something were to happen we're not in a financial position to cover any repairs\nUm no I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency fund so you need to work your way out of that like\nWe teach and that's maybe step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball and then from there\nOnce that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're going to build your emergency fund three to six months\nOf expenses I Do not have any insurance on the things that run to my street on my house is not on any of them and if something breaks I Will just pay somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it it's that simple I Would I Do that well I Would use an emergency fund\nHow did I get an emergency fund a didn't give people like this money [noise]\nSo I had more money now are you taking a risk in the meantime you know I mean you could something happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together and the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nSo here's what's cool\nEver hear the term the rich get richer the poor get poorer well there's several reasons for that and it's not all pressure and and capitalism is evil\nThat's not a\nRich get rich or poor get poorer because by and large poor people who do\nRich people stuff with money become rich people overtime rich people who the rich people stuff with money stay rich people rich people who do poor people's stuff with money become poor people in other words it's about have you ever think it's a set of habits a set of values are set of choices\nThat's part of it the other part is is when you do get your head above water and you get the you know you get Murphy out in\nThe street Sallie Mae has been evicted you have more margin in your life and the weird thing is when you have more marginal in your life you make more money let me give me an example when you have your emergency fund in place\nThe victim you have more margin in your life and the weird thing is when you have more margin in

and she's\nDone a majority of our cars coursework to get an associate from one end to the\nUm about where that would fit into step um 'cause she makes ten Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and programs that she's looking at\nA as a radiology attack which would take her about two years to get done and uh that's made us our ... year ... lab technician would take about a year to get done with her car and the stuff that would try to star and she'd be making thirty eight thousand after that\nOr an HR specialist would take her about three or ... about how the the last you know choice for her to get done so\nWell you know we're not we're not that much debt and I just didn't know where where we should focus on first\nWell the first

thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers in a facility than they are there weren't when people in that way so of the three I think that would be the best long term for\nA two year program did you say a yes or no not\nAt all it would be around Nineteen thousand including our man I'm work but uh she would have to get her associates as well as the actual course work for the degree\nOkay so really what we're saying is is we need Nineteen thousand dollars over the next two years plus we need a about Fifteen thousand to be dead free over the next two years yeah so that's thirty five thousand over two years at Seventeen five a year\nAnd you make about a little over fifty uh yeah so um sounds like you can do Seventeen five a year to me and be that I have free and pay cash for her school in two years\nOkay I've got a cat or a glowing you got to map out mapped the map out but um I may have done something wrong and I was doing the math but I don't think I did\nNot sound right um so he\nHe

I mean thousands part of that is from the or health care act that I got screwed over off\nYou don't ...\nYeah I don't I don't have any credit cards\nAnd you don't have any you know in the car payments car notes right as I said I'm just how a hundred grand with no debt virtually is causing on going out and ride it out [laughter]\nWell weren't where's ... did a budget worded the money go\nI see it as it goes to a you know groceries I pay the rent or do this I Do that but I don't see where it's going than maybe a is the budget maybe\n... were taken by and pay should be what sixty five hundred dollars a month right\nAh yeah well probably close to about four or five a month\n\n\nYou're joining\nYou are here Heather's with us in Lexington, Kentucky by other how are you I'm doing good thanks how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo about a year ago I which positions with a new company and I had the opportunity to switch over my four oh one K.\nI'm about six months after my transition I still have not done not up until this point when I got a statement from um my current and the author of the other day with my standing\nUm so now not the point um my husband and I am maybe step too and I'm not sure whether I should roll over the four oh one K. which it's about ... broken up into almost a third with ... percent tax on um pre tax match um\nI'm not sure if I said well it over or cash it out it's just shy of Ninety five hundred dollars and I don't know if I should put that towards maybe two or judge roll it over and leave it until we get in a point of our baby steps to start investing again\nNever shown retirement unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure because you're going to get hit with your ... plus ... percent penalty just probably by third of it would go to the government and borrow money at thirty three percent interest but off debts bad idea\nAll right that's a ... that's what I Would do is I Would roll led to a higher rate and just get with your smart ghost or pro or whoever you use for your investment advice and\nDo a direct transfer roll over anytime you leave a company always take my money with me\nIn the form of doing a roll over to an IRA and the way of got control of that what it's invested in it it's a it's convenient for me to get my hands on and if you don't have somebody to help you that you ... ... dot com you fill in your stuff it'll drop downloads to people in your area\nThat we recommend ... pro ... and they'll help you out and he's with us in Columbus, Georgia I and I mean how are you\nHow good how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current I'm a nurse and then his and um my current\nOkay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current I'm a nurse and that his and um my current hospital offer to ensure held a life insurance policy\nThat I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer their life and try and hit they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some other means his orders and\nI just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously expensive policy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box that I'm not stuck in a job that I'm unhappy because of this one issue you know\nI don't know how you're going to be making more at the other position it'll be the same okay I'm going to be\nBetter I only have to drive ten minutes instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they had some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\n\nI asked about that and they said the man I spoke with said that it's a bundle package and he doesn't believe that that's the case mhm uh aspect with um our best friend he's a um he said he goes to ... for a while and he's about to manage bond account\nAnd uh that's not my principles\n[laughter] I've never heard of it I I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um I mean you you need to build up a big pile of money he called wells and then you don't have to worry about life insurance so that's the general principle that you moved towards a mountain\nTo pay our house off in December so they don't have any debt um\nAnd so you know as a matter and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm right if you're having a oils that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become\nSelf insured your family's morning 'cause the point is is the family major income to live right on to the extent they don't need that just to the extent you don't need life insurance\nNow have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalling ... calls and their insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nWell I got another diagnosis back in March that when I Lived a life insurance and this diagnosis that um they basically said you get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nNo trying them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and found out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some research and probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five underground how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nAnd you can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but uh um when they hit your record it kind of\nGone down by the actual fact you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nLead on that it probably really I'm In I'm In good health so I mean it could get worse but you know I mean that's how old are you thirty eight okay\nSo I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident\nOf passing away and yours is slightly greater is all is not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not going to worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want and then use your fabulous income which you have\nTo build wells and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you pass away I think your husband struggled through\n... yeah I think you know\nAnd that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\n... shot about three hundred thousand in retirement\nThem and your house is paying for so and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he worked right he worked you know so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job or a book called the calls are under for informational purposes and just doubled trek or sometimes okay\nOkay I Will thank you thank you Michael's with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nOh so overall I'm trying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency fund or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story\nPeople who we call the baby steps\nSean or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story we teach people who we call the baby steps ...\nBaby after one is a thousand dollars already got anything above that goes on baby step to any other money goes on that anything except your home you lose your debt smallest largest you attack that with a vengeance how much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen dollars on a car and I do have a mortgage also in ... what's your household income for fifty five other so how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car pretty quick watch printing quick uh well right now I'm just making the normal and so fast to\nMake sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand to do that math\nNine months\nYeah you have no life you get the car paid off or you sell the car and moved down more than two\nBut you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four twenty four and all those like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got to really expensive car and it's kicking you in the teeth\nSo a payoff have because I thought oh my God it's really expensive car was it worth\nA paid thirty and you make city it was it was my graduation present myself yeah I Will not residents or you're not a president turning opera\nDo myself as I'm going to ruin my life you know know about Santa Rosa okay there must get stupid thing paid off or let's get it let's get assault on that too so you got to be nine months to pay it off with a thousand dollars you got any money saved other than a thousand dollars\nOr or curly with the\nCompany match I'm putting Fifteen to stop putting money in your four O. one K. and didn't get this carpet off\nA ... and I'm putting three hundred dollars a month and doing Americans if on stopped doing the how much of an emergency fund a approaching four thousand dollars correct okay take three of it out put it on the Eighteen you're down to one shop all savings\nAnd completely lenient and simply leave focus and completely affected by this call [noise] if you are unwilling\nTo do those things that we need to sell this car [noise] this is a diver and [noise]\n\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the weddings over there you\nKnow I can think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts an indoctrination it through and through what do you tell people when they ask how you get out of debt you're paying off a hundred and fifty three thousand two hundred three months no matter where you met that's not easy\nIt's not I I think the biggest part was having a budget and having a plan together I'm thinking to that plant every month and a\nSafer for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the whale mingling left and the fact that\nUm while before\nWe met knocking back of my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou're going to run out of the way while you were single yeah absolutely [laughter] good for you guys very very well done I Love that is awesome it you're right that's a great story that's a great story gives me a whole new idea for a new product line there you go\nI think I think to one of the one the biggest things for for us is that um we found out about eight months ago that we are going to be having our first\nChild yeah you know [noise] you know a week we had about two months\nTo go getting out of that and we just hammer down to finish this\nYou know [noise] so uh we\nWe had about two months to go getting out of debt and we just hammered down the finish this often I Know my personal story my father passed away after\nHe was thirty six years old well in our family in a pretty tight spot my mom a as such a hard worker hero the family\nUm had many health problems which make money tough yeah so I get overwhelmed to think that our child will not ever know about that yeah well not ever know how that life is you know and I've\nYou know I'm sure you're I'm sure you you're a fiend about term life insurance through with that\nI Know we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any debt you know what you do you do it to\nThe moon and I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters\nThat here and uh when you don't have another master in your life you only have one it's a lot easier not try on Jesus talked about that so well done your two very very well done so proud of you I'm sure your families are too and you know did you have more cheerleaders or ah I'm guessing you had a lot of cheerleaders\nYet we have a lot later yeah I think you're right and and are if you if you class you know my brother and his wife or the coordinators\nMy mom and step father went through with this as well as highly mom and step father so we are mom and dad's gives me we were all in their kind of together so ah we've we've kind of grown through this and and just very\nGoal oriented but go without a plan to just a dream so that's a thought [laughter] that's what helped\nYou know it's a ... saying they're no good stuff love it love it oh\nCongratulations you too proud of you and you're right that's a great story my favorite in a long time so uh we've got a copy of Chris Hogan book\nFor you speaking of him number one best selling book returns bart but

dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account\nThe hill and valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to send a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow an analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much\nBut you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money a year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nAnd given in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are than okay since some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have\nA volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle high mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on changed my life five years ago I'm getting I think you are currently uh I I got a cruel question I'm In baby steps so the only thing right now I'm paying off my arm Devon and I got a net worth of a half million dollars um [noise]\nWhat happened was was five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture ah was it was making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more\nAre you making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your questions what\nAm I my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nYeah I'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse\nThan the marketplace this idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with so\nMaybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you could probably find somebody with an Asian culture and how you what's your worst that's one of the mouse or\nLoses today Ramsey show [noise]\nAnd that's who I Do business with personally I don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our

being that actually has a little bit of power\nThat can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller to set kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America\nIt's beyond me they treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated\nOr not that good they're not good at anything\nThat I I just don't get it so that that's why we indoors credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did everything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do\nYou know in

went further he's shown himself to be an ... actually idiotic\nI Want you to listen to Cory Booker listen to this carefully says that Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter you should be forced out right now irrespective of whether he's guilty or innocent\nNow this means Cory Booker believes not in the rule of law but the ... and the rule of law list and then the rule of the mob and in Marlboro how can anyone vote for this man so I think both of them have now disqualified themselves\nUp for a any serious consideration beyond what they already are doing here is Cory Booker saying that Mr cabin or\nHis guilt or innocence doesn't matter listen to him and oh three astonishing\nWhen his temperament had been revealed in an emotional moment where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of us and not only not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial the alternate citizen has enough questions being raised that we should not move on to another

they don't want them to teach at Harvard He cannot teach at Harvard so what does a Harvard law education worth less than zero\nIt's worth less than zero this is the Savage Nation the politicians are

the islets conducted by shows the same thing\nThe respect or the ... the the I don't even know where right where the respect as the wrong word their opinion the average person's opinion of car which is that an all time low the average person's opinion of the media is lower than that of Iraq dropping in a New York's sewer\nPeople hate the media and last night we hit a new low a new low in America below that it actually is worse than anything I've ever seen about the ... republic which was so generous to the average German who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something

period in Germany reach such a fever pitch that even middle of the road Germans said enough is enough and they started to rethink their moderate positions they couldn't take it anymore so we have no longer any gate\nAnd they started to rethink their moderate positions that couldn't take it anymore\nSo we have no longer any gatekeepers in the media except to block conservatives like me for oil

mean January is going to be the same it will not be to say my show is changing dramatically one hour of radio one hour of a podcast but many stations that have been desperate to drop me will be dropping to show some new ones will come along I'll be very clear with us all political make no mistake about it\nAnd the radio media landscape is going to move in the same direction as Fox News\nCenter left instead of center right that's what's gonna happen across the media landscape center left instead of center right and they're making a disastrous era or on many many levels\nSo now

and since this whole for Kavanaugh thing began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always defended Kavanaugh and always giving credence to the doctor fraud\nAnd he even

crowd\nHe makes believe or he sounds as though he's speaking on a telephone to a television personality your calls him all the time and I think that's the problem\nI think what happens he goes off the

being a credible um individual and she thought you'll find lady a ... and\nThe about things that the rally I'm just saying for much the teachers stand point you're trying to get a link and Murkowski

don't think last night was intelligently applied and all\nWhen Helen Julie apply that strategy I don't say last night was intelligently applied and all\nAnd then we have of course the in the red state Democrats we've got Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota we have a Joe Manchin of West Virginia and again those are votes that could help push capital over the finish line as well so you know the question is\nAnd before I go back to your phone calls here what is the endgame here one is the president's goal\nAs far as getting Kavanaugh across the finish line\nBecause again the comments last night by the president will not helpful\nFor that particular goal so is it possible that the president has concluded that the fight over cabin on is may be worth more in the midterms than actually having\nJudge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is that a a possibility is there a chance that Trump and his advisors in strategist think that he can get some more mileage by filling up the base getting them out to vote in the midterms\nThan continuing the fight against the Democrats who are doing everything they can and said so from the very beginning\nIf they want they do everything to destroy Israel and make sure the capital is not a confirm Supreme Court justice\nOr maybe that's the strategy here I I don't think it is I still think they want Kavanaugh confirmed but plus that I got to throw everything you know possible against the or the wall here a ... it's just I'm just a little baffled here again\nOf well a little bit of the schizophrenia in how the president was very measured and then now has taken a different turn as\nWe get closer to a potential vote for cabinet I just I I Do not understand that I Can't figure it out you know prior to the allegations made against Kavanaugh back what you know a month ago when uh the confirmation seems like a done deal totally inevitable\nAs a base was acting like it was\nA lone no they didn't know the issue here and there was also a concern that the base might not turn out for the midterms because they weren't buying the fact that Democrats were in a potential position to take back the house of representatives so\nAh they weren't that energized the base wise and this was a big concern internal polling inside at the RMC suggestive is that they were very concerned about the very active based Trump voter in voting in the mid term elections so maybe this is an opportunity\nAnd a is there a chance to Trump is now using capital as a pawn to energize the base to make sure that the house of representatives is still secure for the Republicans lenses everything is possible these days\nSo up with that let's go back to some calls are then we've got to get into this this polygraph issue and the ex boyfriend of Dr Ford\nAgain it is amazing I don't know if we've ever seen this degree of he said she said all the different factions in different layers that keep changing it's it's absolutely amazing\nLet's go to a dog in Las Vegas Nevada Doug ... you're on ... welcome to the program\nThank you for taking my call hey why did she send a letter to her\nCongresswoman if he was so worried about it but I think that [noise] well you know her something secret you know send it to some idiot you know normally well again they went to set up more and more that people can see through it\nWell or dog and I I obviously feel that this was all part of some master plan to keep candidate on from the court or so but well well I\nHave a minute so you have Dr forty sample letter originally to her congresswoman in California and then it was given to a Dianne Feinstein who's the ranking member Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee where\nUh she claimed she didn't leave somebody leak the damn thing I Want an investigation out there who leaked the letter but Dr originally the doctor for originally said\nThat she wants to remain anonymous at of course yeah I I said from the very beginning that it's not going to the anonymity here that were absolutely\nGoing to fight and sure enough a couple of days later we started to find out that it was Dr Ford and her identity was revealed done thanks for the call let's go to Mary in St Clair Michigan Hello Mary you're on Smith\nHi love your show\nIdentity was revealed done thanks for the call let's go to Mary in St Clair Michigan Hello Mary you're on Smith\nHi love your show Dr for I lied to the Senate she said she had two doors down in front of our how if not\nOut of fear but she rented out face in our house also she said she was afraid to fly that she has taken business trip and their cases all over the world and then nearly as that's our parents and also I doubt that far voted for Hillary and she was a political activist for the Democrat Party so I don't believe she lied to the Senate\nI wanted to say merry I don't think that I Would subscribe to the fact that she was an activist now her attorney that Deborah cats\nWho was recommended to her by Dianne Feinstein office now that never catch the attorney for Ford is an activist and she showed up at rallies there's news footage of her talking about resisting the Trump presidency a bus or the other things that you said I'm pretty much in agreement with and\nThere are a lot of inconsistencies not just with our story from back\nIn the Nineteen eighties when she's lay these claims from but also in our current life there there are some inconsistencies at the door the Google interns and and again a fear of flying to come to the hearing but she apparently has no problem getting all over the place Mary thanks for the call let's grab another Mary back to back Mary's let's grab\nThis Mary's in Chicago hello Mary\nHi I just wanted to say I don't think our president is anything wrong I Am glad what he said he just spoke the truth she is nothing but a liar liar or two brothers are lawyers but Feinstein got or a lawyer\nBut hey Mary I'm not arguing I have a lot of problems with Dr Ford and I think that she's lied or misstated I have been suspect since the beginning of the motivations of her the story the recollection of events I I have a lot of questions\nMary I'm coming from the standpoint of the the goal is to get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court right\nYes and I do believe it will be\nSo Mary ... why would the president not stick with hey you can talk about Dr Ford and inconsistencies in the story but it was just it was the tone last night and trying to turn it into a bit or an act\nA law that that that that that's our president that's why we elected him he helped each the truth well common sense\nWell Mary last week somebody had spoken to him about being very measured in temperate on Dr Ford and and obviously worked but he changed his tune and demeanor last night and if you are alienating the Republicans that we need to confirm Kavanaugh\nI just don't think that's a very smart move Mary thanks for the call and must know Mary's mentality ... I'm not I'm not chastising Mary but that's sort of the mentality of a rally crowd where yeah\nAnd so there are plenty of Trump supporters an echo at I'm just pointing out to get Kavanaugh confirmed there is a better chess game that you can play here that's what I'm ... I'm suggesting Scott as next in pace Florida hello Scott Iran Schmidt\nGoing um my biggest problem is mostly would laugh but they all do it uh is when they describe the ladies testimony here they come on them at all and she was so brave she came through and she told her through\nThat's not even a thing you do not everybody don't get their own truth there's only one truth you may never get to it but there's only one that's not even a thing I Wish they'd quit saying that there is no or truth is\nIt's also it's not it's also the the belief that everything she's saying is the gospel everything that she's saying is one hundred percent certified and verified and was like a videotape of VHS play back\nOf that Nineteen eighty two incident when in fact it's very muddled\nIs very muddy and we just don't know what the details on she can't even remember all the details but everyone has presented her\nAnd they they they're putting up on a pedestal like it is the absolute certified fat that everything you know it's happened\nThe way that she claims that I'm Sorry there's a lot of discrepancies Scott thanks for the call I when we get back I Want to just ... and if you on hold hang out we'll go ... go back to calls in a bit but I Want to before we uh\nEnd our number one I just want to lay out the initial story here with the latest he said she said on the polygraph issue so uh we'll get to that next here on Schmidt I Want to welcome a brand new sponsor to the show is blinds galore now I'm In the process right now of course\n...

AT T o the D. S. C. H. and I. T. T. and you never know what you're going to get anywhere and so I was checking some of the responses on Twitter and a lot of folks agree with me\nThat the president just didn't mean to go in the mockery department at the rally Mississippi last night but I Am you know some others that are like oh Schmidt you're a rhino oh yeah I'm a rhino because I Want to see Kavanaugh's confirmed and we don't want to alienate those that are needed to confirm Kavanaugh\nWell we don't know you know when we're it's worth spending we're expecting the FBI to conclude or today\nI Would I just waiting for you know how much actually leaks on the FBI investigation will see so we we don't have anything definitive there but I heard I run I suspected that nothing a outrageous is going to the mic from his investigation going ...\nI I just think that that I I Believe that probably he's reminding people if they did vote against them if it does look like maybe she's not credible and they don't get\nThat maybe it's political are ah we've all seen those pictures of dying Feinstein pushing a metallic ... you know against the wall and the ... and why you know on line but so I think that he's just remind and people are sometimes a little harsh and the wife says buying but but um\nI think there's a timeless Sherry there's a time for Trump to be from and there's a time when you need to use the honey and not to go off those on your side you know even Lindsey Graham sharing the Fox and friends folks this morning toll Trump he was wrong\nI mean ... all over the ... if a slobber fence Fox and friends they slobber over the over Trump from slobber silver Fox and friends they said the Trump was wrong and what he did a with a mockery\nHey you can tell the story I Trump tell the facts all the inconsistencies the problems is just in the tone in the fashion that's\nWhere I don't want to have any additional obstacles in a capital\nA potential vote on the center for that's what I'm saying and even Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham with that stunning amazing stellar defense attacking the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee a has\nBeen very supportive of Kevin on this nominate even Lindsey Graham is saying I'm as the president went a little bit too far Sherman thanks for the call oh let's win Cynthia next in Jacksonville, Florida hello Cynthia you're on Schmidt\nHey thanks to add a couple of things first of all we all who love Trump at least most of the time he gets excited\nAnd I think that the prosecutor knew the answers um to a lot of the question she asked I think she was found in on the flying why\nThe fear of being in a small space why\nAnd there's no doubt there's no jobs if the Republicans had someone tell that they passed along to the prosecutors no doubt about\nThat but with so much at stake\nTrump needs to just quiet town and I respect or even if he knew about the letter from her boyfriend and all that it probably really kicked him off because what the Democrats have done to Kavanaugh is disgusting there's more ... than the lowest of deplorable\nOr a hundred percent of since the I'd I Can't disagree with you I've a talented exactly what you said but it's just acting at the right way if the right time that's\nWhat I think Trump gets all ginned up with these things and I think commonsense sometimes uh you know a ... more or exits his body exits
