it's kind of given him an opportunity to kind of low hanging\nFruit at the softball and uh and he thinks that he's just going to hit it hit it out of the arc right ahead of these midterm election so your your point is well made a ... you had the ramped up really any\nThat he's just going to hit it hit it out of the park right ahead of the midterm election so your ah your point is well made a he has ramped up really anything it's the same position that have had all along a but it doesn't allow him to uh to to re enter this into the news cycle at a very crucial\nWell maybe maybe if a Nancy Pelosi goods conspiratorial should good shape Donald Trump or rain for the caravan to arrive at precisely the right moment before the mid term so that he could bring it back up do you think she can launch conspiracy theory like that\nI was trying to think she could probably dream something like that I thought you know right now you get a lot of finger pointing across the aisle Trump of course is blaming the Democrats for allowing the caravan to come up and the Democrats are pointing right back across it him and saying wait a minute we don't control the government wants to do something about the conditions down there\nAh in in Central America so of course it's going to be a blame game that's immigration in Washington and uh and and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that has changed the course just a a head of these elections it's only going to get a more heated\nMike let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but I'll I'll throw it out you anyway or is it possible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends and the Democratic party but because they thought it's time to get into your into the United states before we hit those midterms in ... changes\n[noise] well you know I think if if they were if they were thinking that you that politically I think that they would have I think they would have waited as you know with the house a kind of favorite to flip to the Democrats right now I think they would think that has a better chance of getting across later\nIn the year or next year or if the Democrats and below sea do take the gavel I you know I think uh you you talked to at least she talked to the advocates and you you talk to the diplomats down there\nAnd there is a lot of our ... there are people legitimately fleeing a very dire situation and and and then of course they're going to be a lot of hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of that situation get across the border when in fact they are probably not a in and you get pretty\nBut uh you you talked to the at least to the advocates and those on the ground down there and they think that uh you know this wouldn't have nothing to do with politics that if it did that they would certainly wait until next year a assuming that the that the house would flip\nWell the other thing about that is that do I understand correctly 'cause I I Do keep an eye on this topic is one of my favorites for the last Twenty years is one that we ought to resolve that ah\nThat the ... that if you say I'm coming from a country where I'm being persecuted by the government because of my race religion or national origin or any of the other protected categories that you have a good chance of being approved as a refugee on the other hand about eighty five percent of refugee claims are refused because people say\nMy country has a stinky economy or my country has you know crime problems those under the law or not legitimate reasons to claim refugee status\nOr ... and certainly yes you're exactly right and is that there are going to be both of course you know people are going to get to the border and and saw him again or probably in a very dire situation uh you know whether it's gang violence or domestic abuse or or whatever the the situation is they're legitimate claims and those people are\nBy and large are are approved after they go through the process then again you're going to have the hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of a of a of an opportunity here and\nUh you know to to claim that poverty is a reason to seek a asylum status or refugee status of course it's no judge appears willing to accept that and those people will probably be refused and deported um but you're certainly right you know the the the broader point that we do have a process in place that\nUh that once people do arrive at the border there's a process that detain\nA and they have to go before a judge before anything can happen and uh you know what the Trump Administration is trying to prevent that from happening at all by having Mexico where some of the Central American government stop the caravan before it even gets to the border so that's kind of where we are right now the negotiation with the Mexican\nA law makers Mexican leaders Mexican authorities and uh there was some rumbling yesterday that a Mexican leaders had said that they would take care of it before they reached the border so this might fizzle out where before they even get to Texas or anywhere on the southern border but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out\nI'm Talking to my littlest who writes for the dog comes down to the other piece of this and I want to know if I'm overreaching because I Am a Trump fan but when the caravan started and it was maybe a thousand before grew to four thousand is it is now may be even bigger than that by now or the president said to Honduras pull that caravan back\nOr you lose your foreign aid he told the same to Guatemala and then he told Mexico you let those folks across\nIn Honduras pull that caravan back\nOr you lose your foreign aid he told the same to Guatemala and then he told Mexico you let those folks across and you may find yourself without a trade deal now I was guessing that does seem to be some pretty powerful motivating of pushes from the president is that the reason that Mexico isn't just opening up the gate and loving them come into\nMexico and then head up the road toward America\nWell actually what Mexico is doing is offering work visas to a lot of these people so you you know all these countries have different relationships and they have different laws and processes that would a company you know people who wanted to\nTo leave or enter a a a a sovereign country um you know the Guatemalan government can't very well tell\nIts citizens that they can't travel outside of the country so\nI don't know what legal authority they would have to do so and then you're in Mexico I'm sure has some kind of visa\nAgreement with all of the Central American countries and there's probably very lenient and there's probably this probably very easy to come and go so what we were hearing yesterday is that the Mexican government was going to offer some work visas and try to get a those people to stay\nIn Mexico and not ... not reached the border as a kind of an appeasement strategy for Trump because he is threatening\nTo close the border he was threatening to put military force at the border and he was a threatening describe most importantly threatening to scrap\nThe newly a negotiated NAFTA deal and of course Mexico a doesn't want any of those things to happen so I I think they're scrambling they're they're trying to figure out a way to uh to peace President Trump and prevent uh this caravan for reaching the border\nMike this is the first time I can remember any American president Republican or Democrat doing that kind of thing telling Mexico knock it off and help us out or you're gonna you're gonna suffer can you think of another example where president has done that\nYou can't know and you know ... and you don't have to go back very far to remember you know who remember the search at the border we talked about under President Obama\nI'm ... and there were just you know thousands and thousands of people and and and a lot of them unaccompanied minors that was when that first started happening or as a result of a lot of the the gangs the escalation of gang violence down there was the recorded reason\nAnd uh but I Know President Trump wasn't pressing those governments to stop the people before they arrived he was just scrambling to find ways to process them once they did\nAnd of course that's why you had all these detention centers or you know President Obama long before President Trump had entered centers or what he didn't do a separate the families which I think that's why that issue blew up\nUm but you know you hear about immigration judges and the the lack of immigration judges and these people get up here and there months or even years sometimes waiting it'd be profit and so it's it's just a bottleneck just the backlogs and uh and I was just a mess when the when the surge like that happened\nIf you are given refugee status and eighty five percent of refugees do not get refugee status they're simply told your circumstances don't justify it you are allowed to access all of America's social service programs so welfare food stamps tan of a section eight housing Medicaid\nAll the rest of that so it's a sweet deal if you can get in as a refugee\nYou could work and make far more money than you made back at home you can be reasonably save at least compared to back at home your kids get to go to school you get medical care and you can access all those free goodies paid for by the American taxpayer and if anybody thinks that's who writes\nOr fair or just or legal I think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcome to walk into the Lars Larson show once on your mind\nYeah no I ... a ... an addict crack the gentleman that\nKnew very for her that meant they drew mall ... yeah yeah he he led ... nobody's Arab here on a green card like anybody else that\nKilled for their country true so why should it man ... any more than if if if and grew and home and got killed and even today Bob\nI ... I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story\nIf somebody I went to the American consulate in Russia or Japan or France and they ended up murdered\nInside that consulate and it's a consulate did say from a friendly country or or country added to lease destined simply an ally of the United states that would be an ... that would be a major story that's not just some foreign national\nWho's gone home and and goes to an M ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a of a crime of some kind\nIt's not just some foreign national who's gone home and and goes to an M ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a of a crime of some kind\nAnd this is somebody who was allegedly killed in an embassy now I Believe that his murder may be more the result of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood the fact that he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and that he identified where they you know the the ridiculous ... end of Islam\nAnd that had more to do with it and the fact that M. B. as the guy runs the crown prince who runs Saudi Arabia right now\nIs trying to westernize their country and the sharia folks\nThe hardcore is llamas do not want that to happen I think that may be more to explain why he ended up dead\nThen the Saudi Government just simply saying we're going to silence a critic by murdering him but he wasn't just a journalist he was a political actor\nAs well and for the most part I understand our media tell them tends to tilt to the left but we say ... to the left imagine somebody who worked for a ... one of these dug huge crowds\nA drop in American cities also worked for a major newspaper or a major news organization like CNN and they played both roles the role of being a political activist\nAs well as the role of being a journalist on television most television outfits even the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate having somebody on a they'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's straight ahead news reporter which is what ... is being presented to Americans and all these stories ads but he was a political actor I mean if you said I have a job with the Democratic National Committee as one of their staffers\nBut I'm also working as a journalist at CNN CNN\nWould say no we're not going to let that happen unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so what they're trying to portray this as is this man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalists I have a feeling that when we finally find out the details\nThat we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was\nAnti Saudi Government right now\nBecause he wants to the Saudi Government to go back to the other direction this the ... that country while they've not always been the best friend they have\nBeen an allied to the United states and I think what the left would like to do are left would like to do is drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Washington DC and the fact is whether you like it or not if we are going to be an actor\nIn that region and we do have to because that region could end up being a national security threat to our country we need some allies there we have one in uh in Israel we could have had one in Iraq\nBut we let everything fall apart when Obama pulled all the troops out and now we've got troops back in there but that could have been a a a freely elected a government with the constitution was written while we were still there we haven't done that and we could have had one in Saudi Arabia and one is that region started to have\nA real you know government of the people instead of governments being run by either dictators or royal families then it when you got one next door you say well why can't our country like Iran why can't we have one that's more responsive\nTo the public they don't right now but they could and the minute you get one next door you're going to say well hey why can't we have a\nDeal like that and I think the Islamic hardliners [noise] they don't want that to happen and they'll kill anybody in a

A. O. recounts that say if the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers\nWill so every time they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime or or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay\nIs there an argument made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\n[noise] um\nThat's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh you know the post ...\nDoes it does nothing to prevent the postal service for simply or demonstrations and simply I'm\nIn charge in China a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as the consequences of this administration's a decision on this um this sort of signal the scent of wanting to try to ... or ... that that that it may do that and that's basically what the ... the tempted to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming into the U.S postal service that's actually\nAs a viable question and something that may actually be looking to do was later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for well I I guess for the way they're trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it the UP you this is this the United nations agency or just says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds\nSo if somebody goes on Amazon and buys something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China if the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos or less uh then they get charged a flat rate and that allows foreign companies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market right well at least if they're sending things by FedEx\nOr UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate um shouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden that you're going to have to pay more to ship\nThings if they're coming from China\nThat might actually make American goods are goods from other places competitive where they're not today and the only difference could be the shipping cost right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that's sort of be angles the administration is looking at him in a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making jail precisely that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need\nThey're making the Alps I see that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the administration is is you know picking up the ah the Thomas a for like ...\nI guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that\nAmazon is selling I've a feeling it's probably a lot and if you you know if every one of them cause another dollar dollar and a half to show a that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up\nTo something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a few tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNow is that no you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are\nBasically sort of turning over all these rocks hum of issues that people haven't looked at her thought about in a long time and forcing people to you know uh to to deal with him and his wife is again it's another one of those sort of interesting cases where they are doing that\nWith air force thing because this has been something that's been going on in the sort of process has been for decades and then the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way maybe we should do a different way and that's one of the interesting things but the minister as you\nWell especially because and this has gone on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that the is that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\nI don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been adjusted for inflation or not I mean there's a ... I Believe the rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know works I I don't actually know the exact mechanism weather works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a percentage of Sonia\nSean you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but would you like to be paying a for gasoline let's say what you were paying in Nineteen sixty that if you were buying gasoline and I I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what it costs now I'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rage or rent\nI remember my parents used by a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house for rent and\nAnd I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment I'll bet a lot of other Americans would do why is it\nThat until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump nobody any of these administrations as you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else and said hey maybe we should bring that rate forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's I mean it it's a that's a good question and the answers that as with so many things it's just so much easier to say I\nFind whatever let let's just let it let it be and move on to something else is somewhat more pressing um and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just haven't been looked at\nHer address talked about in a long time um and this is another one of those sort of issues and it was a lot of things that they brought up and when they were talking about the you know the truth you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about her address in a while and this is in yeah I mean it's not the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking\nThese fundamental questions and there's just that sort of mindset of the standard sort of Washington that never really bother to do it and was things about Trump is that he doesn't subscribe to that mindset of me and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge on some areas but other times\nYou know it takes somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say you know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know the you know the NAFTA\nNegotiations for a good example I mean for a long time people everyone staying what's going is working fine we don't need to just as we do need to rock the boat and Trump said no I'm going to rock the boat and see what happens\nYeah that's exactly what you're doing that again with the decision\nIt just kind of stunned me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what are we charging for this is that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back\nIn Nineteen sixty nine I don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China\nI mean before uh before next and even sort of opened opened us up an open shine up so we had better relations with them I'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but I have to imagine somewhere someone deep and the ... the U.S government was looking at that thing that isn't that\nYeah I mean other than that almost twelve million dollars I'm just under half of that is for historic assets alone so you know do that as you mentioned the lodges that cabins places that we use and the memories that we have these parks um culture landscapes the battlefield to cemeteries all of that I'm I'm all of that\nAnd the places that we use and the memories that we have these parks um culture landscapes the battlefields of cemeteries all of that I'm I'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog\nNow let me ask you this because I'm always want to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass over here and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and it was a very good deals you just going to go to one of the parts one time on one day every year I think you pay thirty bucks but if you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar proud and maybe a little bit more now that they would uh you know the don't let you go to any national\nPark you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal and I feel that part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us want to use the bar to pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors ... nor do I think the taxpayers you pay the whole town is there a way\nTo keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now\nWe we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold should for denies doing five years instead of ten where you could do that how many people visit all of the national park in a way that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nUm is is that is a great question I Know their millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our\nParks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know job or a ... an additional burden on the taxpayer\nAnd in fact the six point five billion dollars which the legislation um proposes um towards this almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from federal middle revenues so this is on show an offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that we um those funds that are already there but they're not\nEarmark I'm right now for national parks are allocated to other programs but I'm not of legislation\nAre a lot of federal budget expert either monitor but if the if money wasn't going to the park to we'd go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bars right\nYeah well the way that these funds are I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate the funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down or adding that increased burden on the taxpayer\nAnd what it does is it is to identifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about um that could benefit the national parks and\nI and I think you know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar influx of funds are they going to ... you know you're talking finding um it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are\nWe going to get back for it and you know to that I went there I mean we'll we'll have the you know the statue of liberty I Will be preserved and that has a a backlog\nA maintenance Vaclav right now Ellis Island and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in our American story um you know that places like the um Little Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas and that is a historic site and brown v board of\nEducation at that you know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get to the numbers of things I mean um we um had an analysis done by the cat and his group and they found that if the if this legislation passed\nIt would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impact\nLocally and caught economies at these national\nParks are part of and so I Would say you know by redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment for with these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring um places that we already know um are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing it\nUp you know ah right now there's a bipartisan support so and so on on both sides I think right now we're we're trying to get through and we're hoping to get this legislation passed\nIn the next month or two after the elections um to to really get boots on the ground and and get to work around a around us so we're we're\nKind of caught into um the the bill is now in in the legislation is now in sub committee and it's coming out of that soon but we you know or need to the Congress to act right now uh to to get this passed for us\nTo do something that they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with those same World War not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that that is the case of [laughter] but but I you know I Would also argue that yeah I I I'm a ... huge preservation is in fact you know of of course I work for the national\nTrust 'em you know but you know preservation as a as a as a bipartisan I'm a you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats like it's going to ... we all care about our heritage I just found that I think it would be hard for

the international law actually permits if somebody has committed a terrorist the trust of theories about two and then on the ... the territory of another country and the country\nActually permit that if somebody has committed a terrorists to drop the theories about two and they're all the ... the director of another country\nIn the country refuses to upper hand or extra die so that you are you permitted by international law to use deadly force against that individual that part of the principles we used only went up to bin Laden in Afghanistan\nIn October of two thousand Milwaukee\nSo yeah but I mean if if your national security is in jeopardy you're not going to hold a press conference or or have happened to go see Asians with with a rogue regime if it's the survival of the nation may be at stake\nSo tell me this what do we need to do to really make this country safe and fight back the way you write about\nWell look I I Am and why we fight goes through country by country threat by threat whether it's trying to whether it's the the hobbies whether it's Russia\nOr a voting for we have to rebuild them at a tree we have to note yeah the ... we have to load that their labs to many cases you can do what they wish to do to America\nAnd then ... you know part of the book is why we buy one of the stories before American heroes that\nDr ... let me ask you about this this is a divided country and it's not just divided because the media says it's divided we see really serious a disagreement between people we've seen friendships and and\nAnd and perhaps even marriages dissolve over the disagreements over President Trump's occupy you know his position in the White House a can a country is divided his dad be still be effective in meeting these challenges against our enemies around the world\nWe we have been more divided in the ... remember the biggest war we ever for was not\nWorld War two wasn't even Vietnam the greatest number of casualties more than half a million Americans killed with our own civil war or during Vietnam I Believe we were more divided but the idea that we've we've we've never been more divided I don't buy it but of course it makes\nThings difficult but I think more and more Americans are waking up to who Donald Trump is and how he wants to protect this nation from old threats and has to guarantee operas first you so you know I Am an American now proud American\nAnd as a result I'm an optimist and I think that the ... the sleeping giant is awakening\nYou know it's funny ... they just say that because I I see people coming together in ways that I think even the mainstream media wouldn't have expected I went back last week and looked up the percentage of the black vote that Donald Trump got in twenty sixteen not quite two years ago and it was eight percent by the middle of last\nYear twenty Seventeen he was at twenty three percent almost three times the number that he got ... votes in the election and this year he's already at thirty six percent\nAnd that kind of grows would make almost anybody in any field very happy and yet the mainstream media and that's on one of the most divisive issues that America's face and that of race and whether or not a\nBlack American citizens feel they're being treated appropriately and equitably it seems that an awful lot of black Americans are a huge percentage in\nPercentage terms has decided this is the president we like\nTo I I think what did we see in twenty sixteen and incredible\nSilent majority the mainstream media that that Hillary has more than Ninety percent chance of winning the afternoon posed as something like Ninety seven to ... percent John's water ... she lost vulgar Trump won I think in the last two years that they go\nOff of five percentage of silence vote this can only have increased about why I remain very very called for the\nAnd yet the other side and especially the media player in the media is a big player in this seems willing to do almost anything even entertain a lies to win a fight like the fight that occurred over the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nYeah I mean in in in my book why we fight I talk about with the famed as well as it could chambers was was justice Kavanaugh before dusty capital was even born so you know in Nineteen forty eight\nOf mine who had been a former communist agents stood up and Congress and the first of all televised live testimony and told the world who the secret agents were communists inside government including ... hits\nBoth the televised live does demoted I'm told the world who the secret agents would communist inside government including I'll just hit the left tried to destroy him they used to being a homosexual an alcoholic or you know everything you can imagine and it was\nOld lives so that the Democrats have made a bargain with the double the ends justify the means if you were shocked that well they did the cabin law than you need to open a history book because they did it because ... they did it the jobs the jobs are\nYou'll of they did it to a with the good faith is back in Nineteen forty eight\nI'm Talking to Dr Sebastian Gorka who's the author most recently of why we fight 'em before we wrap up this segment because I Want to talk to you about Islam and the next segment\nUm you you you mentioned the the kind of tactics that are willing to use\nAnd it strikes me that there are also willing to to have a very deep double standard just last week there were folks who were I guess for lack of a better term gay shaming a Lindsey Graham ah by suggesting that ah that because he said you know that that somehow he's he's homosexual and and that kind of treatment of people\nOrdinarily get you shouted down these days in America if you either decide to out somebody or cast\nA slur by suggesting that they're gay and yet the Democrats and the left seem willing to do it and the media seems willing to amplify that as well\nBlog that doesn't get you shouted down it destroys your Korea if a conservative did to Lindsey Graham was the last\n... or if they can serve the district called gay west will the left I mean think about it the left on on cable TV called Kanye West and east ignorance negro anybody on the right path that whoever is would\nBe over the racism homophobia\nIs home ... is a law by the great

for a long time but why don't you tell her audience ...\nShore odd numbers usa is a ... organization\nA focus on equal ... at a course concentrate also we go to on illegal immigration as well ... ... ... ... a sustainability\nYeah did you say your primary you're getting cut off a little bit there did you say your primary job was league you know folks in legal or illegal immigration\nI our primary focus is focusing on legal immigration but of course illegal immigration a lot of people come here legally of actually becoming become illegal immigrants so so we focus so you do you spend some time on illegal immigration as well\nDo you uh support legal immigration or have certain numbers of that you'd like to see\nWe do ... ... ah what support is Sally ...\nOr so that means that we support ending chain migration which is\nWhich are the family reunification immigration Walker um we ... we would like to see the lottery ended up well we'd like to see 'em we are\nAll like to see the the the uh employment based green cards I'm giving out a highly skilled workers where there's truly need and the American workforce for those kinds of workers that are coming it\nSounds a lot like the administration's position right with the ending chain migration\nForce for those kinds of workers that are coming it\nSounds a lot like the administration's position right with the ending chain migration and are supporting the visas with high end talent when I was I agree with the president\nCreated this bipartisan commission in the Nineteen nineties any assigned Barbara Jordan the former ... and nobody would accuse Barbara Jordan and hurt democratic regret credentials as the chairwoman of of that bipartisan congressional commission and the joint commission recommended or what we\nWe advocate for today is it called for ending chain migration and ending nobody is a lottery and reducing legal immigration to their recommendation was reached that down to about five hundred fifty thousand which at that time the current level was about a million which is around where it's at today so so there was bipartisan support for this\nBut you had a huge push over the years especially in the early years in the in the mid to late nineties you had a huge\nBush from big business U.S Chamber of commerce groups like that\nThat that always want more workers because they look at it as as as a a a\nSupply and demand issue if you have a large pool of labor than you can keep wages lower it's just simple a gas price supply and demand\nType type theory I'm so ... you had the big business groups pushing for more immigration and in the mid to late Nineteen nineties but then you start to see more of a special interest groups the immigration attorneys um some of the some of the um\nSome of the more ethnic ... groups after the two thousands start to get a kick a large interest in in legal immigration and naturally when you started to see a big shift in the Democratic party\nWell so that you know I during the week I've been mentioning so you had the conspiracy not a conspiracy but there there's mutual coming together adventurous the Democrats won more votes they see the power Republicans would call in the country club Republicans like the wall Street Journal I told my listeners they start the title of the editorial it would say\nA talk of as if they're going to talk about illegal immigration and somewhere in the middle aged which on me and talk about how great immigrant and swear\nAnd I thought OK you guys to see into my subscription if you're going to play with

it it it keeps us busy there are very very few times ... on the front pages of the nation's major newspapers 'em or not being discussed somewhere I think I've been with numbers just over ten years now\nAnd I think we've had like maybe six months where nothing has nothing has really gone on over those over the years but typically there's usually always something going on there's there's always another caravan edits away or something oh I\nGotcha and now you're national forecast Romney tracks\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas there'll be little change today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday for the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today\nStates um and and it looks like it hasn't worked to too much with the Central American countries\nBut Mexico is these giving me appearance that that they're going to try to stop this caravan from from reaching the U.S Mexico border um that they're taking it fairly seriously at least they're giving an impression that they're taking it very thoroughly seriously swap to see what actually happens\nWhen they when they reach Mexico's southern border and want to gain entry into into Mexico to get up to the United states but again that the caller was absolutely right what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to game our asylum system once they get here they're either going to try to\nGet in illegally undetected or they're going to come through a um a port of entry and claim asylum or when they if they do try to come in illegally undetected but get\nDetected apprehended by border patrol then they'll entered their asylum ... by defensive asylum ... but again they can't enter an asylum plea unless they get into the United states so my recommendation is\nKeep 'em outside of the United states the U.S Mexico will allow us to move our asylum educators and say okay if you seriously wanted me consider or\nFor as a ... year in the United states than what we'll do is we'll send our asylum educators to you will hear your case and then we'll only allow you into the United states if you pass\nThrough the initial tests which is a credible fear test [laughter] but I think\nThat I'm trying to again if you want to read a lot when we both agree wait a second that's marked alber he won every button when we both agreed with you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah um well here's your here's here's my problem uh we we got her own right who's here you know what they're called the call they're called homeless they got sixty thousand people in in California under sneak their their veterans their women children\n... and ... ... ... why ... why are we concerned with the other people's problems\nWhen we got her if you can't take care of the Iraqis are homeless refugees here that's my point I'm going to bring out here when filly eight it take care of that I say let the government of the ... of the\nOf the origin of where they came from the government takes care of them in the responsible dislike we should try to take care of our homeless vets and and the women and children do you see what I'm saying\nOh absolutely and then I'm going to lead Chris and we do follow you can go ahead ...\nNow now I couldn't agree with you more and that\nAnd that's the reason why we take the position that we take on immigration world we want to reduce legal immigration levels as well because we have our own issues here in the United states\nThat that we need to take care of now when we're dealing with foreign aid and ... what money do we give to other countries to think there's a there's a number of different things that we could do like the first that plays a little bit more into a foreign policy type ...\nSo they were in our strategic reasons why we provide foreign aid to some of these countries that we we provide we provide aid to I think just as as as the world leader you know the United states is the biggest strongest nation on earth we do have to take a little bit of responsibility to make sure that there is you know that that that\nThere are human rights violations and governments are oppressing their people things like that around the world and we we've always done that throughout\nOur at you know throughout our two hundred year or two hundred and fifty year history [noise] um so when it comes to that but I think there are also other things that the government can do I think the government can encourage business to go down at best and some of these countries maybe give them\nAnd so when it comes to that but I think there are also other things that the government can do I think the government can encourage business to go down at best and some of these countries maybe give them some sort of a tax break for investing in some of these more needy countries in the helping to rebuild those countries so there are other ways besides just foreign aid\nBut but I think going back to your original plank couldn't agree with you more I think that's why we can't take a ... every single person in in every other country that happened to be living below the poverty level because we have to landfill Americans who are struggling in the United states today that we also need\nTo take care of we need to put them first and that's what we need to do we need to start putting Americans as far as the head of the rest of the ... walks\nNow I Want you to clarify this for me see if I understood some someone just gets their leg over on our side of the border they can then legally request asylum\nThey can they can legally request asylum ethics and the definition of asylum do is you have to have spear persecution back the whole country from your government\nBecause of their race religion political views or a social group that you have to belong to that's not just federal law but that also ...\nHowever what we've seen over the last decade or so is that the very very per se that\nTo claiming asylum you're the United states is that you have what's called a credible fear interview and in that interview you say that I have a fear of returning back to my country because of X Y and Z well what happened was we lowered the credible your standard so that somebody could claim\nCriminal gang violence or domestic abuse or or something like that\nBut it got hooked on the actual definition of a one and I finally is so because of that we've allowed people\nTo claim asylum who don't actually qualify for asylum by the time they get ... judge they get their case rejected and they're and they're sent back home so what the what the administration led by attorney general Jeff Sessions and it's been an act by the department of homeland security they tried to like the credible your standard\nBut that does a lot of public why does not out of all your interview that's how I think it's so important for this this caravan that that may be heading our way is is for the United states to prevent them from entering the country as they want to claim asylum\nTo that credible your interview outside of the United states once they get in they're not getting out so we can't let them [noise]\nYeah but they can they can pretend and in their advisors lawyers whatever can tell them what to say I don't know how you prove a negative you prove that they don't have fear the harm or a persecution that have money you know back to their country and how do you do anybody I'm just trying to say can claim and if they're trained to say the right words\nYes well usually I mean usually the the that that the state department at the federal government is usually pretty aware of what type of government persecution are happening on a country by country basics so\nThat we haven't seen much of it you know obviously we know that there are violations rates in showing I in in in in other countries you know we know that we know that if if if if you lived in North Korea for example and\nAnd she believes you're you're not a communist state

between your joints the heart the brain your eyes your energy you name it now when you hit fifty you have\nTo pay attention to your health we all know that so whether you're forty or fifty or senior sixties or seventies or even older for that matter are just today says he's discovered something that you can unlock the key\nTo feeling better at any age but this is exciting what is it what are we talking about why do you need to know about this we'll stay tuned Dr ... eleven is on the line here Dr Neil Evan is a chiropractor he's a nutritionist he's a longtime advisor for purity products welcome Dr Lehman so great to have you back on the show today this was a big story isn't it\nOh absolutely ... and let's go right to the chase here that discovery you talked about at the top there\nIt's cruel oil because crude oil is simply amazing for oh it's great for the heart great for the joints good for the brain for the eyes I mean I have people coming into my clinic every single day and they want to feel better I mean they want to feel physically better stronger they want their choice to feel comfortable but they want to stay mentally sharp\nThey want to keep their brain thinking like it did when they were younger they want to protect\nThemselves from the coronary heart disease and maintain those flexible health a youthful arteries for one for circulation hasty they want to lose their energy and you know why not I mean we deserved it and that's what we're going to be talking about here today with this cruel omega fifty\nPlus which is the cutting edge combination Steve of crude oil which is so fabulous for us but we in the crew will notice shoes so important we didn't use the crew or with you\nThe nation's Steve of crude oil which is so fabulous for us but we infused the crew will notice is so important we've infused the cruel and with the high omega three\nConcentrated fish all you need to do that when you're dealing with pro because cruel just isn't high enough\nAnd omega threes so many other important parameters and virtues but\nYou got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both worlds but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of crow by sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrients in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting as cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in eleventh grade studies are out there many experts are declaring that's cruel oil is better than fish oil so give us this low down on his krill omega fifty plus formula\nRight right right the you know if I told you I did talk about this before the show that this is one tiny pill that benefits the joints and the brain memory mood coronary heart disease wonderful for the arteries makes your hair shine great for the skin I mean what would you say that\nHey where is it working I get\nIt right and we have it it's cruel and bigger fifty plus and we're going to give it to everybody for free today and that's really cool because parity want everybody to try this because they know they're going to see a huge difference but get this\nOn top of that for the first thousand people that call today and they were given a\nSecond gift because I just demanded this you know when we're dealing with the fifty plus her and said hey you know if you're forty and you feel like your energy is lower this is for you also but for people fifty and over we're also giving away free be twelve energy melts demand this because hey as we're getting a little older we don't absorb that be twelve is well and I want you to feel\nThe benefits from this cruel and make a fifty plus I Want to Jack up those B. twelve levels for you today as well you know why don't value proposition\nYou know when it comes to your health they really is a win win this is amazing I heard you say that this can actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease I mean when you hear that whose ears don't perk up after that how exactly does that work anyway\nRight right well Kroenig or fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with the high omega three highly concentrated they should also which is much higher and omega threes than most crude oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the high omega three fish oil we're talking about\nSupport for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy youthful flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation who heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little capillaries oh what about triglycerides that become so important so\nThis criminal fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways and you know the bottom line is we need to think about this because\nAs we're getting a little older fifty plus maybe mid forties certainly sixties and seventies\nIt's decision time I mean you know your body's not working the way it did when you were in your thirties energy might not be there you need to make a decision or you're going to take it laying down and just let yourself get old or are you going to do something about are you going to stay physically active you are you going to do the things you need to stay healthy\nAnd getting these omega threes that crude oil the vitamin D the antioxidants makes such a difference this is a game changer for anybody in at fifty plus age group\nNow this is absolutely great information I Know that a mega threes talked about that just for a second her best known for their cardiovascular benefits\nAnd there are certainly also known as brain so now we discuss this in some of the past shows if you would touch on the brain benefits for our listeners listening out there today and tell us why you say that supplementing with omega threes isn't just a good idea for the brain but an absolute necessity\nWell you know obviously these are the girls guys talking right right right but you could look at it both ways let's get into cruel and just a moment but first let's have official guys on the shoulder because you know you could say that the fish oil is better and stronger but we're talking about the concentrated high omega three fish oil here because it's higher\nAnd you know making three D. E. P. A. N. D. H. here that are so important\nFor the heart brain the memory mood your eyes you scan your hair your nails so in one sense you could say well the fish oils better but\nIn another sense I have to hand it to the crew guys because in terms of antioxidant power crude oil is extraordinary and it's because there's a molecule and crew oil that's naturally occurring called actors Hampton and after that then Steve this is one of the most powerful\nAntioxidants we've ever discovered Steve by one measure of antioxidant activity at six thousand times stronger than that\nThe most powerful antioxidants we've ever discovered Steve by one measure of antioxidant activity at six thousand times stronger than vitamin C. Y. do amazing band the opposite in power in the criminal and now as we're getting older fifty clusters like myself I'm fifty two and\nWe don't make as many antioxidants naturally are antioxidants systems are kind of slowing down and at the same time we're producing more free radicals naturally if this is why we call it cruel omega fifty plus extra antioxidant power\nAnd extra chromosome number five hundred milligrams of crew instead of three hundred and sixty seven percent more plus the vitamin D so important for us\nAnd this is just incredible value proposition I of folks that were going out and they were getting the colonel separately the fish oil separately the antioxidants you could spend Seventy five bucks doing that no kidding you're getting at all for free today this is the best of both worlds this combination product with the cruel and official and it's not one being better than the other\nThey're both great and this is the best of both worlds\nYou know thank God for purity products I'm Serious [laughter] seriously because when you think about where our food supply is gone and where we are today we have to have something that allows us to feel better as we age to age gracefully it's amazing to me is we try and that's why I\nLove the way the purity gives way the free bottles lives you know people can be skeptical said it'd be skeptical but now they can be skeptical and they say okay you know what the sounds pretty important I'm going to give this go it's only going to cost me six Ninety five\nAnd they get it and they try it out and what they start to see because it doesn't take long remember the joints thirty seven days twenty percent more comfortable\nBut they start to seize hey I'm more comfortable I feel better they noticed their energy is better than they realize hey you know what\nThis is important and they tell their friends and they tell their relatives and they tell their loved ones and purity has been doing business this way for I don't know Twenty years now let's look at one more you know this is a great it's the Modi will buy Gracie five at a five star she writes it works\nI feel a difference in my choice after only one we also have the nicest staff that's what I call it ... the of the nation staff people are going to appreciate working with purity\nThey're a fantastic company they put their money where their mouth is they give out free bottles and you try and you're like wow this is great stuff thank God for purity\nLet's talk about the heart health for a moment it's probably the single greatest concern that people face as they age so anything that we can do to boost hard health becomes really a top priority you know this I Know this and those folks out there and do this as well\nAnd I know you mentioned earlier that omega threes literally lower our risk a corner and heart disease do I have that correct 'cause that's a huge statement\nYou know absolutely and and protecting the heart this is what put omega threes on them that back in the seventies Dr ... discovered you know how protective they were for the Eskimos by the way is a wonderful guy had\nLunch with them a year or two ago great conversation but bottom line is omega threes protect our heart in so many ways they promote a smooth rhythm ethical heartbeat\nImportant for the bodies normal inflammatory response in the heart muscle inside the arteries and pains they promote those youthful flexible arteries so important for circulation they promote healthy blood platelets activity help your red blood cell activity\nWho support healthy blood pressure that's very important\nTriglycerides so they do so much for the heart to simply amazing cardio vascular protection with these omega threes\nAnd it just keeps getting better then that's it you know like I don't know how to remind\nPeople I have patients come in here all the time and I'm like are you taking your omega threes I Hope you're still taking your omega threes you know they are afraid to say you know like the omega three doctors take your omega threes\nIn fact if there was only one nutrient that I could take Steve honest to God if there was only one nutrient that I could take hands down to make it through the first most important nutrient indiscriminate fifty plus the love the way the combined the crew oil with the official she even the best of both worlds can't beat it\nI've got to remind our listeners out there about this free bottle you know what's going on the grill and make a plus and the beach well\nIt is a part of the special radio offer today you just pay the

fifty plus and you're free beach wild energy miles by calling one eight hundred five hundred in Eighteen forty two again one eight hundred five hundred Eighteen forty to\nDock this study you sent me on this mega three and the memory is amazing it seems that the participants taking omega threes had some pretty incredible benefits here when you talk about memory that is something that kind of slips as we get older tell us more about this what you\nAre right this was a great study and important study because what they did he was very interesting this out of the journal neurology and but then they just they check the omega three level in the bread\nImportant study because what they did he was very interesting this out of the journal neurology and but then they just they check the omega three level\nIn the red blood cells of women a thousand women older women so this is a big study that I was in women but then again ... years later and the women were on average Seventy eight years old at this point they did MRI's scans of the women's brains\nAnd what they found Steve this is so amazing\nThey found that the brain volume for the women that had higher omega three indexes and in other words they had more omega threes in red blood cells the women that had more omega threes and they're red blood cells they had higher brain volume they were actually maintaining more\nOf the youth full size of the brain their brains were bigger you could see it plainly any MRI measurements that's really cool but not only that there is a very important part of the brain noticed the hippocampus very important part of the brain that facilitates learning\nFacilitates memory and there was greater brain volume in the hippocampus for people that had more omega threes and they're red blood cells that's how you can really measure\nHow much of making three someone's taking into if you take omega threes you will raise your omega three index we know this it's a fact you take omega threes you raise that have to you want to have\nMore omega threes in your bloodstream very important that senator and fuses into all the cell membranes and the challenge them to the brain et cetera\nSo take the criminal maker fifty plus you get the crew loyal sixty seven percent in more criminals so fantastic for the joints you get behind omega three fish oil vitamin D in there as well as this anthem for extra antioxidant power and protect that ran protect your memory facilitate that quick\nThat youthful thinking that's so fun to have when you when you feel shark when you bring his work and great you have the brain energy it's more fun it's more fun to be in a conversation you feel better you wake up at a bed\nYou have that energy you feel mentally alert you feel why that's the way I Want to feel that's the way young people feel that's why we put this in this crew lawmaker fifty plus we want people to feel younger we want people to maintain a youthful vigor an attitude and that's what this cruel and make a fifty plus is all about\nI I got to tell your doctor ... I think the grill omega fifty plus and one of the things that I absolutely love about the bills and it's so small I mean it's so easy to take\nAnd so much better than trying to small one of those omega three horse tells you know the bigger ones anyone can these with ease and that's what's great about tell us how did you super charge this formula while the same time shrinking the castle ... how do you do that in ...\nAnd it's so amazing this is really a breakthrough Steven I mean I heard those of you that are picturing this huge omega three pills it's not like that these are tiny they're so small anybody can swallow these my son Corey\nHas trouble swallowing pills she can seem like they're nothing they're much smaller they're easy to swallow and now with our lemon lock flavor system which I didn't even talk about before you open the bottle up Steven smells like Lehman we live in the freshness again extra antioxidant protection\nExtra ... oil high omega three fish oil super charging the amount of omega threes and their vitamin D and one of value here easy to swallow super fresh great value again my patients if they were getting the stuff before they saw me\nYou can be spending Seventy five eighty dollars to get this combination to an incredible value\n... and here's what I Want you to do pick up the phone pretty quick because believe it or not a thousand sounds like a lot but it's not that the bigger radio stations they move fast legs call soon get your free bottle of the crew lawmaker fifty plus everybody's getting that door you're definitely going to get that but if you're one of the first thousand call or send you get the free\nHe told energy mouse or do we need to talk about that one more time but I wanted to get there too and I demand this because this is growing like a fifty plus we want this but the folks have if you're in your forties and you feel run down it's great for you to but fifties sixties seventies folks in that age bracket they're not absorbing the beat twelve as well because they're losing some of the intrinsic factors\nIn the G I tracked that are responsible for absorb them to be twelve so now you're put to be twelve energy on your tongue\nTastes delicious and it just gets in there and boost up those levels be twelve what do you feel when you're boost your level of beats well if you had been low you feel more energy because be twelve help speed the red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues\nAnd if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something\nSystem that made that much vitamin D that quickly\nAnd if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels\nOr fifty or sixty or Seventy so that's the natural level\nAnd studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood level to be fifty or sixty\nYou have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to them maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that you'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nI don't know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor\nHas to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research and then you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are the symptoms I could look for that when you tell me pat you probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic feel will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and about\nA week talking about vitamin D is effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally weather or there's sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health\nThose are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it\nBecause they've been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we move is normal yeah\nSo you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health talking you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S [noise]\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody as vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you defined vitamin D deficiency is anybody in less than thirty and about\nHalf of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking that idea level is forty in many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you this when when people start supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D with a product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\nYeah that probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I just mean this feeling that you know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month a month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything\nYou know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level this low in and that's one of the first thing that and the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move to a very similar to the closed we had for heart health we're going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator\nThe better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun for the higher the altitude you live at the better your mode\nAnd mood improved in the summertime some mood improved in the summertime and worst things in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a a a number of studies listen to this type and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found\nThey found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven time\nEleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold visas at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about\nThree hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so and what stood out was their feelings of

call us at eight seven seven seven to six talk where we got plenty of stories this week and one of the stories has to do with probiotics you know last week a story came across\nThe media or which then here's a sample headline probiotics are mostly useless and can actually hurt you talking about a click bait headlines\nOr this is a story that is highly inaccurately reported a steady based on a mere Fifteen volunteers\nResearchers at the white Smith Institute in Israel gave probiotics to the volunteers and lo and behold they discovered that only in some of them did the probiotics actually\nAppear in their stool samples\nAnd as a result of that they claim that provide acts are useless\nAnd this is something that we've long noted is that when you do is to test on somebody taking certain probiotics sometimes the robotics don't appear in the stool suggesting that they don't take root they don't colonized a however\nThe researchers themselves readily admits relying on fecal samples as an indicator what goes on to the gut\nIs inaccurate and wrong and I'm quoting the researchers themselves never lost a journalist so fit to publish the headline probiotics are mostly useless based on this study\nAnd here's this study that came out just a couple of days ago actually just yesterday out of Georgetown University medical center headline probiotic use may reduce antibiotic prescriptions and here's what the researchers found\nUsa probiotics this link to reduce need for antibiotic treatment and infants and children\nIt's in the European journal public health and the study found that when the results from twelve studies were pulled together\nYou see in the European journal public health\nAnd the study found that when the results from twelve studies were pulled together\nInfants and children were kept this twenty nine percent less likely to have been prescribed the antibiotics if they receive pro buyout acts as a daily health supplements I'll take that any day but then they refine their analysis and they repeated it\nThey looked at what they term only the highest quality studies\nAnd then this percentage increase to\nFifty three percent reduction in the need for antibiotic soaps a spectacular result the findings are very intriguing researchers say quote given this finding potentially one way to reduce the use of antibiotics is to use pro bioethics on a regular\nBasis\nThis according to the leading a steady and best to gator Daniel ... he's a Georgetown University school of medicine and are they going to say we already have evidence that consuming probiotics reduces the incidence generation and so they already have certain types of common acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nAnd more studies are needed in all ages particularly in the elderly to see if sustained provide accuses connected to an overall reduction antibiotic prescriptions if so this could potentially have a huge impact\nOn the use of probiotics in general medicine and consumers in general this according to Sarah king from Cambridge University who also participated in the study so what's going on here so the provide X hits purported\nTo not work when you take a probiotic\nAnd to provide it doesn't show up and your stool sample so is it useless then will the answer is but doesn't necessarily mean it's useless and I've got to say that I myself have dabbled in checking my own stool samples using the various services that are available\nAnd mostly what I found was disappointing is I on a daily basis take up robotic doctor here as robotic which contains lactobacillus I've taken many other robotics and consistently I find that I have zero lactobacillus in mice tool in\nMany by patients as similar find it so what's going on with that does that mean provide acts are not working they're not taking sort of like spreading seeds in the Sahara Desert that's an active futility because the soil is not conducive to their growth\nSo does that mean that they're used for the answer is no because probiotics may work in a different way and some people because there's something called bacterial cross talk bacteria in the intestinal tract\nInteract with our immune system a large part of it which resides in what are called the tires patches in our large intestine from these tires patches\nAre actually receptors for information from the bacteria that populate\nOur intestinal tracks are micro biome and if you have a healthy microbiomes you have healthy beneficial cross talk and if you have an unhealthy micro biome was bad bacteria and a lack of good bacteria your immune system gets the wrong signals\nAnd so based on this idea of cross stock it certainly is plausible but even if I had to buy the stone in plant and grow in your intestinal tract they're doing something more over\n... may be responsible for the synthesis of beneficial compounds\nVitamins nutrients that are essential for the functioning of the immune system and for the bodily functioning generally [noise]\nAnd so the claim probiotics are mostly useless is an act of journalistic malpractice [noise] yet another distortion [noise] from the mainstream media [noise] I'm

is the deal or not and not a Chevy dealer but yes a lot and I bought our um they've been doing the work I've had my mechanic kind of double check\nThe code makes sure that's all it was going wrong with it and he ran it on his machine and looked at it and it's very well ms fire I'm only a couple of thousand misses fires ... is a ...\nUm how many miles how many miles are on this\nAh one one thirty one twenty seven when I pick it up and I have one thirty one about\nOkay so now we know why it was traded in right um yeah you always want to write a or is it out so you know ms fires miss fire doesn't necessarily have to be ignition it can be\n... you know and I I I say this all the time it can be I always look at the example in point that you know you ever use a snow blower relief or lawnmower\nOr if you leave the choke on too long the engine starts to run rough right uh you know that's a that's a rich fuel condition miss fire if you have an Orange Park like that's an ignition ms fire if it has a burn valve that's a mechanical miss fire\nSo you know it's the same thing on our automobiles just you've got eight soldiers instead of one\nSo they they sound like they've gone through the ignition they they gassed in through a bunch of port set up for that and that didn't do it so now it's you know is it fuel is it I liked what they did was smoke in the intake is it is it you know a vacuum leak somehow affecting an issue although generally vacuum leaks aren't going to get picked up a fight all\nBut smoking the intake isn't a bad idea of these have these have a tendency to go through and take some gas gets rather ah so that's not the worst idea one of the things I'd like somebody to do is is go through what we call crank shift variation learn\nThis particular generation or two or three or four or five you know had an issue where it would lose its ability to know\nCrank shift position and so you went through a crank chef learned procedure which has to be done with a scandal\nOr right not every scan tool has at the the factory tech to does I'm not sure if a snap Bonner a launcher an OTC will but it's it's it's just a procedure that goes through under special functions\nThat will allow the person to re index or re learned the crank in relation to the cameras and and the rest of the vehicle so that it's it's it's bicycles rockets or in the right place at the right time you follow\nRight I fall and and and and and before I go anywhere else with this although I I think you do have some sort of a problem because you're seeing a flashing light um although crank she had learned crank shipped out of index will cause a a you know an engine performance problem\nMy next step cause I I don't like to spend money on parts unless I Know what I'm doing you know that I'm I'm actually kind of a from like yeah this is bad I don't like from parts of the car\nI Want to do the easy stuff first um I Would look for bulletins which I don't know I Know there's a bunch but there are a lot of them are going to point towards crank learn on but I Would do a crank learn procedure I Would verify you know when it happens which two soldiers are being affected is it consistently those two cylinders\nAnd if it is I Would not rule out the possibility of carbon deposits\nAnd you know now what do I have a valid trained valves spring issue the fact that it happened at Seventy ... yeah the fact that it happened Seventy two miles an hour coasting you know when you're when you're kind of backpedaling as I as I think of it but I I I Would look more towards you know I Would double check\nOr take it back to the shop you can always bring it back to us and and I'll drive it next plane and educate the customers a lot of customers don't understand

somebody comes in and and picks up their vehicle or they're they're getting ready to approve the repair actually\nUh they they brought it into you and you know Gerald Suzie okay it's five thousand dollars to fix this and but gee Gerald the the guy around the corner was was four thousand dollars in you know you look at the list and listen to the parts of the same what's going to be different and those two estimates why is there a thousand dollars differences or some difference in the parts maybe\nUh sometimes it's a different kind of arch and make sure you understand is that a used car or a\nA ... market part as than a cat a certified part or is it being repaired and not replace that might be the same amount of lines but a lot of shops electing to pair of park as opposed to replacing it\nAh we're not real big into a repairing headlights because it's hard to get them back to pre accident condition right after it was my goal\nYeah and I guess you know when you pick the car up you want to walk around looking dumb what gaps in the doors and the paint mentioned that kinda stuff\n[noise] well yeah I mean the cars aren't built perfect from the factory but yet if you look at the gas

need that clean environment you really need a spray booth to paint cars today it's not like Twenty years ago\nYeah and then from the factory they're using a lot of ... we have to and they after market

vehicle full is important to consider the type of code that has been set\nDifferent diagnostic strategies may be may need to be used some types are easy to diagnose and others\nWill start with what's

seal them just no longer broken the history code indicates that existed at one time but currently the fault is not present a bottom line Steve is explaining things very technical things in every day common language\nAnd I think the book is in free press I don't think it's published yet\nA he had sent me an advance copy and I'm going to tell you when this book comes out I think it's going to be a must read for a lot of people technicians and technicians students and uh you know the the listeners to this radio show the the weekend warriors\nBecause um you know I I I think is just common everyday language uh being being put into what is a very technical subject so kudos to Steve and let them read the Steven and uh you know keep it coming to jump\nOn the ... ... email a couple of

a Nineteen eighty five BMW three Eighteen Seventy three thousand miles on and having ... sometimes it works when starting out than or drop to zero the times at one show speed what could be the cause and how do I fix get a new was ripped panel or any advice would be appreciated Fred Fred these um\nHis memory serves me correct as a couple of things that could be this could be the center of the trends um ah that that drives it I Believe this was an electronics but under a this is one of the early electronics but ... they have problems with the signal generator out of the transmission they also have problems with the ... the ... the diameter motor\nI'm at at at the instrument cluster itself and they would have to be repaired there's some serious diagnostics tests that have to be done in order\nTo be accurate um you need to get it into a shop and let them do some bolted readings and measurements eighty five was a a interesting year for BMW this wouldn't BMW was leading the charge in terms of uh electrical diagnostics\nAnd you know it's it's not necessarily that you have to change the whole instrument cluster likely there's going to be repair internally to different pieces and parts\nAnd this one I thought this was a great question Ron How well I think all they're all great questions just some of them just captured my imagination Ron\nHow will all these new LAPD headlights entail I work on cars in the cold winter areas like Wisconsin the old allergens heat it up to melt ice and snow from the light puzzles while driving daily Dieter cooler cold won't they just freeze over now we have a twenty Eighteen jeep wrangler with these kinds of lights first winter's coming\nI noticed that a jeep after market catalog that you can order the lights with without heaters built in apparently the heaters can melt ice I'm not sure the factory thought of that yet your thoughts I I've I've got to tell you Steve I you know what it's an excellent question Mr re do they uh\nBut eh ladies are cool to the touch correct\nThey do produce a certain amount of heat but they they are cool to touch because they don't draw that much courage and so it it it\nIt is an interesting comment ...\nThe ... it is um you know where when you take a look at that bright are really nice for example like power lights um people don't realize that that top flash involved in the towers twelve hundred watch 'em that's all and that's a lot of power\nThe L. E. D. version of that ball will take go maybe\nA hundred watts but that hundred watts of he has to get dissipated someplace so there's a big mama heat sync on there um but it does produce a hundred watch heat so the ladies do produce heat in quantity right but not but you know you wonder if it's enough to\nI'm gone there um but it does produce a hundred watch heat so the only these do produce heat in quantity right but not\nBut you know you wonder if it's enough to melt ice and snow and thirty two degrees I'm Steve make some really great comments here I'm going to say you know I haven't thought about when yet I\nI haven't seen it as a complaint I haven't seen anybody you know make a statement about it\nNow I I Wonder if the surrounding lights like I'm thinking about the new plowed truck the new plowed truck has what I Believe ... elite the lights are elite the headlights upfront no they're H. I. D. I'm Sorry they're H. I. D. lambs and the twenty twenty Nineteen Silverado\nSo it does not heavily de headlights I'm\nSo I'm Wondering so maybe we don't run Eli days Steve you know what I'm going to have to look at the wrangler do they really have a lead the headlights if they do then there's got to be a way around it if they don't\nThen that's the answer the question but yeah that's a that's an interesting concept there we go again right technology is is just every time we change something there's something else to think about\nAnd it it used to be that a car just you got in it it was simple it took you from a to B now it's just an event just trying to go anywhere um you know how technology has changed and evolved\nAnd again I've said this before and I'll say it again you know that technology comes at a price because you think about parts availability you think about the training the skill set I was reading an article and one of the forums this morning\nYou know diesel let's start there do you think diesel is is still that alternate power source that they're chasing or does it just to have specific\nApplication specific vehicles\nWell certainly you know our door max our big our big Silverado a big engine and the and the Silverado offers you know great performance and balance with the economy and and able to pull some big stuff but uh we have diesel thin you know the smaller cars and the crews and the equinox\nI needed the small truck to Colorado but\nKnow right now or the whole diesel thing is kind of up in the air because of Volkswagen I tell you I was in Ireland a couple of weeks ago and all they have a ... on the street for the most part I drove one for a week and it was it was a terrific car huh uh\nI I I think the market's gonna come back around to appreciate that the diesel are running clean a quiet fuels available not like it was ten years ago\nRight and it it seems like you know it seems like the the vehicles the alternative sources whether its diesel electric or gifts\nAny issues that come up along the way it seems like a lot of the stuff is easier fix today because it's a lot of times it's software and we'll put a flash and it will change the program and will modify those will modify that whereas you know ten years ago Fifteen Years ago it had to come in parts had to be replaced there were you know recalls were harder than I think is is that a fair statement\nYeah and there's a lot of technology out of the car today so that's one of the reasons why the electron clean get the right power but the same with the gas engines and there's there's multiple computers on there and and uh\nAnd systems to keep the mission is a you know the missions low and they had the gas mileage happen still give you ... performance right on the car costs are nice when it's cold and it runs good when it's hot or I think if there are recalls often the recalls are things where they're just really programming\nOr changing timing curves your fuel ratios\nAh because there is that they found a better algorithm to make carbon that\nYou know what really impressed me I'm an embarrassing herbal I'm Sorry but what really impressed me about you is I was looking at the Google reviews for parameters Chevrolet now I don't know if that ...
