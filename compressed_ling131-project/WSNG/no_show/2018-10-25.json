Connecticut\nMark what part of Connecticut are you in 'cause it just says Connecticut on my screen\nNew Fairfield\nWell hello new Fairfield mark you're on headed\nYou just wanted to ask you at what point did drop the PC tiptoeing around the caravans and start calling it the the invasion than it is I mean it's an attack on American sovereignty I mean I\nWas just wondering what the average we looked like I just looked at federal New Orleans a thousand British troops from about New Orleans\nYou know they were coming to do war against the United states take our property this now is whatever the number is into the teams of thousands you know the theme of the whatever the number is\nAnd they're coming to take our our monetary resources you know they're ... they're not coming violently but their\nFirst act as a potential American citizen breaking laws and then there's that can act or the consequences breaking our laws which is consuming our resources and one of the things that you can Google up quite easily that you know\nThe United states taxpayers spend billions on illegal immigrant healthcare\nEveryone we know adolescent at ... ... talk to a hospital administrators and hospitals across the country especially those in some of these border states are they getting nailed it getting hammered with all this illegal alien this indigent care it's bleeding them\nAnd you know part of that is you know why are people that show up they get charged a you know thirty seven dollars for an aspirin\nAnd also a less mark a hundred percent it is an invasion it needs to be repelled there is no expectation that you can knock on our door and we have to let you in I mean do it the right way we welcome immigrants to this country but not mobs that are now the caravan allegedly like fourteen thousand strong\nAs a secretary vantage form and\nIt needs to be stopped and I I I'm not politically correct I'm gonna tell you right now they're illegal aliens that are trying to break our laws by busting through our front door illegally and yeah\nThe Trump Administration or any administration or has the fiduciary responsibility to stop it you know I don't know if you've heard the audio clip of President Trump tweeted out and Obama sound bite or from Obama years ago talking about or a ... did you see that\nAre diverted yeah yeah I mean I was\nLike if you agree with Obama you know your your with\nYour with the current administration on the need to enforce the laws cut of the kind of thing and then you know the the media will keep you know regurgitate in the ... the racism and\nAnti immigrant thing but I mean what there's a everybody in America has the story of a friend I I've gotten numerous friends of all nationalities you know north south east and west of the border\nWho have wives and family members that have come in legally follow the process and then just shake their heads why you know\nWho have wives family members that have come in legally follow the route that and then just shake their headed why you know why do these people who won't follow the process in one poll laws in fact open leaks loud lot why do they deserve our respecting compassion\nParticularly when they purposely organize\nYou know with with the goal of of clouded or\n[noise] or you're not going to get harder than we're on we're on the same page and you know I have the audio bite so President Trump about twenty two hours ago he pointed out I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nAnd old and a Trump tweeted out a video of then Senator Barack Obama from Illinois where he said this and\nWe're sitting here carefully there are a generous and welcoming people here in the United states for those who said or the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law or and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the becomes ... in this country\nSo there it is and a Trump retweeted Obama senator then and Obama's a hundred percent right and proper saying I agree a hundred percent mark thanks for the call let's go to a oh let's say in Connecticut let's go to Robin then very Connecticut Rob Iran Schmidt hello\nHey how's it going at once and I do have one comment about the care of it I call up and making Kelly thing but yeah you know I I Wonder why why is not a president or start putting this on the state's wired wired and not\nGetting the state's involved and voicing their concern you know especially like Anchorage they are proposing a solutions to her you know because the craziest thing of the world is the catch and release right we catch them give them a court date and let them go free right are we not proposing some type of working with\nWe're willing to accept these illegals and they had found voice their concerns for you know is the president or are we want you to protect us because it's going to backfire on on the president matter what he does\nThat and you're you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't\nAnd you you have the century states like look at look at California California is um one of the largest recipients if not the largest of the illegal immigrants a a migration and\nLook how their resources on a state level attached but you know they're they're willing to accept that it's unbelievable and either you or your survey you know the bulk of these democratic politicians in California they'll tell you open borders I mean they're insane they they just don't get it or Rob you wanted to talk about Megan Kelly as well\nYeah I agree with a clear case and forgive me if you're already talked about the origin of the ... my understanding is is that\nAt a time when black people were not allowed to perform in white performances whether it's planes ... early movies\nThat the characters were put on black face to portray the black characters in other words they weren't using wax things to mock lynching right this was just the same or Mike as many many years before that women weren't allowed to perform right so the men took on the women's roles is bound plane\nSo I'm just wondering why is my hope outrage Pittsburgh people now are allowed to perform right and ... ... ...\n... why do you live someone wants to portray a black person for Halloween like example making probably gave 'em to be Diana Ross wouldn't make\nWhen you least Robert listen because of a minstrel show activity\nAnd just the the racist over the top exaggerated\nPerformance as they did occur a blackface is not acceptable and the way that it has been portrayed I I Can't make any argument or or agree with you on that point today what's the big deal here it has been unacceptable a for decades and decades\nEven you know prior to this ah\nOverwhelming wave of what we'll call you know political correctness it hasn't\nBeen All

Institute for foreign policy and national security and retired army special forces officer and a top Pentagon official esteem thanks for your service to American uniform and thanks for taking the time tonight\n[noise] sure thing thanks for having me back on the show so tell me this ... do you have do we have any hints ah from what we know today about these these devices that were delivered earlier today and discovered a where they might be coming from or what they might be motivated by\nA well we the public don't have any idea 'cause we don't have the you know the post marks and all that stuff to to look at and and decipher ah I'll be willing to bet at the FBI and the secret service are probably closing in on whoever sent these devices because\nUsing the mail to do this sort of thing\nLeaves a lot of travels a lot more than most people realize\nA and you know not everybody is is what is the Unabomber was stay out there as long as he did uh most of these folks get caught pretty quickly so I I think while we don't know yet they haven't announced any of it properly uh well I think there there probably are\nOn the trail of whoever did this\nI Would expect that is true too and while I'm not an expert on crime scene investigation things like that over the years I've read too many stories about folks who build explosive devices and they tend to leave all kinds of\nOf evidence inside of them whether it's DNA whether it's fingerprints whether it's just the source of the materials that they're able to track down unless you're very careful as a bomb maker I Would imagine you're going to leave those kinds of hints and clues that might take up and this is clearly going to be\nThe focus of a lot of America's a you know law enforcement or until this is solved or the ... I I think you're right they are going to track this back\nTo the person who sent them I'm kinda curious about whether or not you think at this point\nWe can even make an educated guess about what might be motivating since these devices arrived a exclusively at the addresses of of prominent Democrat and liberal politicians in America we initially heard a report the door device and send to the White House that was quickly pulled back\nAnd it was it exclusively the sorrows Clinton's Obama's John Brennan of\nWho I think would probably resist any kind of titled but I think I could call on a a you know a a a tool of the left at this point I'm said that because they were sent a Democrat you might think well then the source must have been conservatives but it could also be uh something designed to bring some kind of sympathy or a fold flag\nAnd I don't ordinarily believe unfolds flags as we are less than two weeks before an election\n[noise] yeah I I think you're right I mean in the same way that you know when that guy shot up a Republican\nHouse softball teams ... is a it was highly likely that that person who's going to turn out to be somebody really didn't like Republicans are and as it turned out that was the case\nOr in this case I think that the first to fall ... is obviously this is somebody who is not particularly enamored\nTo people with strong liberal leanings and or people that are overly critical of President Trump but we can't really make that determination and until we get other corroborating evidence that says that ah you know the fact that not one of the devices\nWent off they were all discovered\nI tell you maybe they weren't intended to go off maybe this was a false flag we don't know uh you know fortunately looking at the pictures that I've seen is that devices that we're not exactly you know rocket science kind of a formation and it was they were pretty crude\nAs one of my colleagues Jim ... said today that the picture of the passage of the bomb will probably go down in in some FBI class saying\nThis is what a pipe bomb in the mail will look like it was you know that kind of obvious that that there was something there to to do more investigation on but we won't now and we shouldn't really make any drawing conclusions\nInto law enforcement finishes his investigation and we find out what the real motivation\nOf whoever did this was\nKnow Steve you at the same reaction I did when I saw that sort of crumbled up manila envelope it and and you know that putting a pipe inside of that before anybody even open to your immediately going to wonder what is very heavy feels like a steel pipe inside of an envelope maybe in addition to not intending for them to go off\nYou wanted them to be discovered fairly early whereas\nI have a couple of boxes sitting on my studio desk right now that are from Amazon Prime I don't even know what\nAnd to be discovered fairly early whereas\nI have a couple of boxes sitting on my studio desk right now that are from Amazon Prime I don't even know what's inside of them and\nOccasionally my wife orders and things that are particularly heavy but if they're packed inside a box I don't know what's in there and you can see it from the outside you'd think if somebody wanted a bomb to make good self make its way all the way inside somebody's office packing it that way\nWould would uh you know would actually concealing but if you wanted it to be discovered early on before and we all know the pipe bombs can go off or inadvertently\nMaybe would packages exactly that way so that it would be immediately recognized as a suspicious package\n[noise] yeah they you know one of the things we need to wait for is the you know the FBI\nInvestigation of the device itself because they'll be able to tell a lot from that\nYou know did they intend for it to go off what do they have operated the way they thought it would or would it be something like that bomb that was in the trunk of the car in times square where the guy who thought he had made a really effective big bomb and you know he just fail we couldn't follow the Internet instructions\nOr you know so we'll we'll have to say about that and then as we talked about the other forensic clues that should be in there\nThe mail you know I'll be honest with you I'm surprised the post office ... because they're usually pretty good right when you step up to the counter asking all those questions sealing the thing\nYou know and if you don't give them legitimate answers\nThat gives them a feeling of comfort that they will ... what\nA and and this kind of looked like something suspicious in the passage to me that you know hindsight's always twenty twenty so we'll we'll see where those but uh it's a little early to draw conclusions\nAre and attach political motivation to it but now it it sure looks like there's some politics involved on one side or the other\nI Would think so too and Steve I've had that same problem when you have to convince the post office it's not a bottle of whiskey you're sending to a friend but actually a bottle of olive oil you know if you can't be convincing there they're not they're not going to have either as FedEx either they won't take it either\nYeah I mean when my son was deployed in Iraq he needed some batteries for his high speed flashlight or that he couldn't get in the little PXs over there and you're not supposed to mail\nBatteries to people so I I'll and this maybe I'm going out for a pet\nBatteries inside a bag of Amman net so that you know he could get the batteries they needed you know in combat or and you know you can do it but it it takes some imagination and some\nIs because one of them has a ... no but I mean when you look at the outside of one of these you know the fact that they did the Amazon boxes\n'cause my wife order stuff and you know it's it's safer to have it arrived here at work\nYou don't know what's inside one of those Amazon boxes and believe me she has ordered some incredibly heavy stuff from time to time and there's and there's also the stuff where it feels like it's a box full of air so ... you know if you wanted to really conceal it\nYou would have concealed it inside a bubble wrap inside a box you would've taped and shot you you you might have even ... copied some of the markings of a UPS box or an Amazon Prime box\nBut if you act like if you package did\nIf you went to all that effort to build these things and then package did in a way that anybody who picks up a manila envelope that feels like it has a pipe in it and he has an immediately suspicious I'd be amazed I think they were designed to be ... based on the way they look they were designed them yes ...\nIf you look at the end it will be a BSO pay for for terrorism is and the other that's what's in the textbook that ... what is the end that they've put really be missing is is is is is the cut and paste letters like a ... I'm ... I'm going to get you know that's the only thing that's missing from that you know I ...\nI saw a comment from a from a cop I Know not not long ago where he said he he was involved in in covering kidnappings in ransoms and things like that for Twenty years he never once a note made up of letters or words cut out of magazines faces the only place he had ever seen that\nWas in movies and TV but he never actually seen it himself so I kinda wonder we don't want to mix up too much of movies and TV with real live thanks for the call by the way and glad you called in from Alabama to go to Steve in Washington hasty welcome to the Lars Larson show\nFact check on the phone call are so I've got two questions about this whole thing\nIt's the welcome to the Lars Larson show\n... phone call are so I've got two questions about this whole thing\nThe the one on the photos that was ... that were treated out first thing that really\nReally ... it just made sites all about this ... it is why were they treated our police have those photos that's the first question those photos shouldn't be accessible by the public right now and also if you open up a package and there's a bomb in it\nAre you going to stick around and take a photo ... bomber you gonna sail\nNo I'd I'd be ... I'd be stepping away is Suzie and things that always amazes me when people say I came home and found the front door my\nHouse unlocked and I knew were allotted or broken into and I decided to go in and see what was going on look I'm no coward but I think it would and wouldn't be sensible to do that if you find your house broken into you step back\nWalk away and called the police and if you find a bomb in your office you step back\nTell everybody else to leave\nAnd you call the police and you get out of the way and you probably don't fire up your cell phone near the possible bomb you know you you leave and you're right that it does seem odd that what amounts to evidence would be so quickly disseminated to the public unless of course I mean and did the same thing has struck me that when Cuomo\nThe governor of New York decided about two or three hours ago to to go out and deploy a hundred national\nGuard to the streets of New York\nThe part of that that doesn't make sense to me is you're talking about packages arriving in the mail what is a National Guard soldier in uniform\nA standing at the end of an intersection\nAnd he said he's deployed them to positions of infrastructure is almost like you know the joke that Hillary Clinton said that her private email server stored in the basement or in the shed bill bill's love Shaq and ... was safe because there was a secret service of the secret service was guarding the property and I thought\nSecret Service does not stop electrons from flowing down a wire or over Internet\nTo get to your your ... or email server or and nor does

side most ... in fact\nWhen Republicans call me or conservatives called me and they say hey let's go on and have a protest and lunch yell and scream and you know carry signs and and and all that I see that's that's not the way conservatives act\nAnd we are conservative where I live on the left does to they'll go out and you know remember the day off\nAnd and all that I say that's that's not the way conservatives act we are conservative where I left the left does to they'll go out and you know remember the day after the inauguration the big women's march where vehicles are set on fire people whereas assaulted bad\nThings happen to have you ever seen conservatives in America do that\nNow I'm not going to say there aren't any individual conservatives will throw upon you or maybe try and push down our door but I'm saying for the most part\nThe big protest some conservatives like Tea Party protests are peaceful there well ordered and they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived whereas when the left shows up you can usually count on broken windows people assaulted\nAnd you saw all the assaults on Donald Trump supporters through the entire campaign when people would show up an an event that was not their event\nThey would they were there not to listen and maybe pick apart what the candidate was saying I think that's legitimate I go to a liberal or you know speeches on occasion so that I can hear what they're saying\nBut I don't see the kind of behavior by conservatives that I see that comes from the left do you\nSee any examples of that like what does it looked at the a president who am I ... and now I'm looking at the guy he said several things during the campaign police don't be so so kind to the president's bump their heads and you put them in a said\nOil ... exactly but Paul at some point words are turned into actions or they're not you you and and I know that that's true in both sides there are people who say that guy makes me so mad I Want to kill him have you ever heard of a friend of yours say that\nYeah somewhat I and have they ever killed anyone\nYour friends you know so there are so here's the difference there is a a wide difference usually between what people say\nAnd what people actually do but when people actually do those things when they show up at political rallies and say this isn't even my rally it's not my candidate I'm going to show up and I'm going to disrupt it so that nobody can speak and by the way\nWhen you see hearings on Capitol Hill and the left doesn't like what's going on in the hearing they show up and tried to disrupt the event you see conservatives doing that\n[noise] um I I think if you are if if you're willing to do it get the Southern Poverty law ads\nThat bond that bungee is morally bankrupt and they don't tell the truth they might have at one point\nOut is that what evidence do you have\nThat well because I've seen and I know some of the groups I've covered some of the groups that they have labeled as hate groups they labeled as hate groups any group that doesn't agree with them politically which is very is is a kind of political bigotry it's the kind of thing that if you're at work and there's a guy\nAt work you don't like and he said he has the best idea you've ever heard it or your bonds ever hurting his life and you say that guy's fat\nOr that guy staying where he doesn't take a shower or you know or you know his ... you know he smells like arm pedaled as you say well what about his idea oh it doesn't matter he's fat ... ... it's the political bigotry where you say none of those the ideas coming from that person or any good I'm\nTelling you that when I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see one where conservative show up and they say uh we don't we don't like the content of this hearing so we're going to disrupt it that is almost exclusively an activity of the left\nAnd the protests the mass protests from the women's march to the Occupy to black lives matter to antifa are all from the left there usually all potentially violent some kind some cases actually violent people get hurt things get burned down things get broken\nYou can't blind to conservative incidence of the same gun Kenya\nWell uh the neo Nazis identify with the light and the skinhead Neal\nListen you've got to remember you don't want a Nazi is that's the national socialist party it was invented by Adolf Hitler you know and and yeah but\nIt wasn't starts most it all\nYeah yes it was if you took a look at Germany's economy it was very much socialist they said the states controls everything and you will produce for the state and you will be subsumed by the state if the state tells you will if it is socialism as\nThe ownership and I say that socialism is the ownership of the means of production\nI have to give up my plan and told me that oh this will be better for you to Bernie Sanders says I don't trust for the first one I got and you know like most Americans I think ... I Believe that it would be a good thing to cover you know Americans said every American citizen defending the you know regardless of their income for out you know for health expenditures or\nYou know major or health problems that they might have I think most Americans believe that\nBut and and most American say we have a system to provide the benefits to them but Americans don't want to give up their own health insurance you know Ninety percent of us has health insurance we all want to you know wound Arnold plant you know so that ... percent or don't have healthcare get it just give them a healthcare voucher and let him go out and shop for health care\nYou know that's the way I feel that the veterans you know you mentioned the veterans plant you I experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me you know I get good health\nCoverage from the vet DAS but all we have Walter Reed right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world but other veterans say I I you know get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they go to another hospital well I'm a choice guy that the Democrats don't believe in choice they\nBelieve in forcing you into the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal\nI Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do while eliminating now here's what I Do in place Steve to pieces first of all let's deal with the pre existing condition crowd which is about\nSomewhere between two hundred thousand and maybe a high end of four hundred thousand people because we know those numbers because of the people who signed up for Obamacare with preexisting conditions when they wiped out all the risk bowls so those two hundred thousand people could be covered as I understand the numbers for maybe ten Fifteen billion dollars out of a downward thousand\nBillion dollar federal budget I like saying four thousand billion while they were saying if you made four thousand bucks a month could you afford Fifteen bucks for this black people would say or for the you know forty thousand bucks a year could you afford a hundred and fifty dollars for this just to make them out to easy\nThen I go sure so that's part one just cover everybody with a preexisting condition that who has ... let's say wealth blow up a million bucks for half a million bucks and ... below ... a hundred thousand dollars yeah if you're over a hundred thousand you got to take care of yourself second\nWhat I'd like to do is have the government say\nWe will ... define what a good catastrophic plan\nIs because this is the second group is all of us yes ... I get hit by\nA truck and or you know I get hit by heart attack and I need a hundred and fifty thousand dollar operation if I don't have health care and I do um then I Need to have that bypass covered or the trans fat and covered or whatever your kid\nNeeds a new kidney okay we'll take care of it but we'll take care of it by saying we will offer a catastrophic plan for those people who want to go a fact of lead bear they're not going\nTo have any insurance except catastrophic\nAnd they say is like you know the having having a a collusion insurance\nOn Harlem yeah total owner's insurance homeowners hundreds of tourists in case you're out and burns down I don't want to see\nEven on homeowners I bumped my deductible from a thousand five thousand because they said why my wife said well why is it well for house burned down\nA then we have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burns down you know five thousand bucks but the the chance of that is very low and the savings\nBy going to that it gives you a really low premium so you do those two things but you don't have the government provided you say to the insurance industry develop this product and if you meet the criteria so we can tell people it has the good housekeeping into Donald Trump seal of approval on it\nThen pick from one of the news and the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally where I could get to premiums like that couldn't way\nYeah I mean let's think of it this way whatever they said you know McDonalds is the best restaurants in the you know fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nFast food right that's right we do the Burger King lead on I'd advise you know everybody can just go to McDonalds well first of all what do you think would happen to the quality of food it as an adult that they had already had the right car but that's the logic on healthcare

the bombastic mouse on television and the Internet to hell with them for years or so\nI'm back to the Lars Larson show it's a pleasure\nTo be with you and I'm going to take your phone calls and emails of course everyone in America is wondering where do those bombs come from the bombs are turned up at CNN\nAt the home of Hillary and Bill Clinton at the home of Brock and Michelle Obama or John Brennan's office and also it others including Maxine Waters\nWell we're gonna talk about that a bit tonight I'm going to talk with you because I Want to hear what you have to say I think you've heard my position is that\nThis is starting for the little information we have about the bombs the way they appeared the way they were delivered their construction is already starting to be the subject of a comment by people who are bomb experts who say they are amateurish\nDid they seem to have been designed not to function in other words you deliver a bomb but you never intend forward to go off and you intend for it to be found very quickly so you package\nIt in such a way that is easily identified as a suspicious package sure to be open quickly quickly identified and never go off\nSo what's the purpose of that and why would you if you really despise the left and said I don't like Nancy Pelosi I don't like a Hillary Clinton I don't like the Obamas I don't like Maxine Waters are Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Eric Holder\nIf you were going to deliver a bomb which is in itself an illegal act and it's a threat of violence it is an attempt to terrorize why would you do it if you didn't\nWhich is in itself an illegal act\nAnd it's a threat of violence it is an attempt to terrorize why would you do it if you didn't ever intend for the bomb to go off and you intended for the bomb to be found as quickly as possible identified him presumably removed what would be the point of something like that\nAnyway we'll talk about it tonight the department of homeland security has confirmed information about criminals hiding in the illegal immigrant caravan it is the happiest\nPlaces on earth so why is it so full of the remains of dead people I'll tell you about one of the cobs

emails that eight\nSix six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nI'd like to talk to some about some things other than bombs tonight as well and you might ask yourself from time to time what is the key to innovation is a technology or is it freedom will John Tam to use the director of the freedomworks Center for economic freedom and it's good to have you back on the program John thanks for the time did I\nHave ours it's great to be here thanks for having me on\nI'm Glad to do it I I Know that there are some people out there who think that innovation comes about because of government edict clearly President Obama thought that he could just declare that cars will get fifty miles to the gallon and ordered the scientists to come up with something like a Darth Vader saying\nYou will develop this you will I mean if they'd been around would at us and it was around he wouldn't have had to go through ten thousand different to fill a message to figure out what would never lie ball go he just needed a president or a or an emperor someone just to order him to do it\nBut actually come about because of freedom doesn't charge or\nIs it [laughter] I Love what you say is not true with\nIt or to the Democrats that they still believe in ... oldest fantasy that the Internet exist because the government event that in fact the government misused massive amounts of resources to create something that was totally out of work for the private sector only for private actors\nTo to actually make it work on the private sector and it just raises the question if government weren't spending billions and hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars a year for all this time\nImagine how much quicker we would have gotten to the Internet to no government can never innovate and one reason that can't is because failure does not on what it does to\nYour point about Edison Edison to fail thousands of\nTimes to get to the light bulb government can't do that\nAnd in this case is there a way for America to get back to the kind of freedom but it's always made I ... I say always maybe I'm being too broad there has for a long time made America a center of innovation not just technologically but I think I even in terms of the way we live our lives with their freedoms\nLong time made America a center of innovation not just technologically but I think I even in terms of the way we live our lives of the freedoms we enjoy we're we're in innovative country compared to the rest of the world\nOh we we are and and more innovative let's stress that were innovative because we're free um think about it if if Steve Jobs his father had left Syria does anyone say that apple would would now be the most valuable company in the world only that it'd be a a headquartered in Damascus\nAnd the reality is that the U.S is where counted people are able to achieve great things because they're free to the mistake\nAnd this has made I think by people on both sides they say the U.S has a innovation innovative adds a technological edge them in the U.S has no such thing free individuals in the United states\nHave a tendency to be very innovative but this is not an American thing as an individual things that don't think the government can can can foster more this this is about freeing individuals to be great\nWell and that's what I'm Talking about I'm I'm saying if there was a way I've always thought the government should be like ... I don't I don't ride horses a lot but I like riding horses when I can\nAnd I've always thought somebody was really good at it\nCould set on a horse hold the reins in his hand and not pull a whole lot if you're the kind of guy or gal who has to take those range and yank them around to get the horse to do what you wanted to do then you're pretty bad at it if you're really good at it you just kind of give a little direction here and there and you're mostly stay out of the way you know laissez faire approach to this\nOf course the just the people left alone left to their own devices allowed to prosper have a tendency to prosper and and and what's important here is is that we want this to happen in global it why is the U.S so great\nInterest as an innovative power yes our people are free but think about what our innovations have meant for the rest of the world that was the world impoverished by the fact that Microsoft was headquartered in Seattle that Amazon's Seattle that Apple's\nBased in Cupertino, California can I throw in Nike is based in Portland, Oregon none of the world has been made better off by genius and say you look at this in a broad sense the beauty of happy having markets open\nIs that it means that the innovation it's as though it happened right next door even though I've never lived in Portland I wearing Nike shoes all the time\nAnd I'm Better for it even though I've never lived in Cupertino I and and and the much better more productive person thanks to apple and so what we want is not American innovation we want global innovation we want\nThat Steve Jobs around the world of each have a great things but they are much better our living standards will be a talented people from around the world are free to be great\nWell in fact I've never seen Nike written up this way maybe somebody has but I'm not aware of it but they're right in my backyard and I I I have great admiration for the company although I think their choice of Colin Kaepernick is rather sad but come as a spokesman but have you noticed a you correct me on this but I think\nThey first made their first shoes in Japan\nAnd then they moved out of there and I believe they went to Taiwan and then they went to China and I think they went from China to Vietnam they might have had to stop in Korea South Korea at some point but what happened was every time they went into a place for\nA while Americans can sneer at making five dollars a day sewing soccer balls or whatever it is\nThey have to accept that all the third world countries that were I was born a third world country I was born in Taiwan and it was definitely a third world country when I was born there and fifty nine today\nIs one of the biggest producers electronics on the planet I think it's half the laptops or Ninety percent of the desktops are made and that in that one tiny little country why well there was a time when sewing shoes are booming shoes was was a good job and and as as their economy rose because of that activity\nThey said oh we don't need to make shoes anymore and Nike said and we don't need to pay these prices anymore they moved on but it was almost like Nike has it moved from place to place was like an economic lawnmower you know you what's your left behind was ... you know a society that had the opportunity to make laptop computers that they might never have had\nA band that a couple of decades American tennis shoes\nOh absolutely I mean he he put it very well a yes Nike started the first place country in which there she was manufactured was in fact Japan Japan was destroyed by World War two and said they started making shoes for people like Nike and then\nAs you say they move to different countries like I Love the story about Vietnam simply because the people who worked in their factories these alleged sweat sweat shops first began by walking to work then they bike\nTo work then they wrote scooters to work by the end they're driving cars to work but I think about it and you look at China Today as as you well know Latin been born in Taiwan, China was\nThen they wrote scooters to work by the end they're driving cars to war but I think about it and you look at China Today is as you well know platinum and born in China was once it desperately poor country a Nike that is I think according to shoot dog which I Know you've read\nPhil Knight said there that that's where they manufacture more peril and issues than anywhere in the world I think about what are the transformative impact Nike is hat and so I'm merely said okay we've got all these innovators in the United states and who's dead or the world\nI Want innovators from around the world to do great things because they'll better the United states per se it doesn't matter where something is made if our markets are open will benefit as those late next door I wear Nikes all the time is not never let me call\nJohn it's a pleasure to have you on and thanks for the work to do it freedomworks\nThanks for having me\nLaw under glad to have you on this John Tammany with us by the way I Want to tell you about a product that I fell in love with more than Twenty years ago in fact in about a week teen and I'm Mark one fold Twenty years\nOf sleeping on sleep number bed every night\nHow does a great night sleep improve your performance how 'bout more energy\nLess brain far better mood and more productivity I can speak to that personally the news sleep number three sixty smart bed I sleep on one and so this is Tina help to every one from parents to pro athletes\nTo talk show host improve their daily performance for great quality sleep my sleep number setting is sixty five Fifteen is is a forty five\nI've had that conversation with ... and they said hey if you pretend that if you simulate a gun in a way that the bank teller believes is a gun it is still armed robbery under the law whether you had a gun or not so\nIt's just as I say just I'm not trying to minimize it but if it's attention seeking behavior\nAre we likely to see more of this kind of thing because you know this is this does terrorize people\nYeah I I Do think we might see more and then you might see also the the dirty copy cats and ... who lost all of that religion is the secret service law school I'm a little over ...\nRoderick tapes future behavior ... you know the whoever this is I'm going to say well I'm not surprised or they're going to have a history of either mental illness\nOr committing thoughts to call them regardless of their means mode of opportunity and um you know those little eat this will be off limits on either done something like this before or sit there where you know I always go back to the Unabomber uh the way the Unabomber and he ran for years nobody can figure out how he was\nWell Tilly printed they put it in his manifesto and as soon as his brother read it they knew he knew exactly who was it was his brother\nYeah because you recognize a lot of the uh what did you go ride that that line of crazy that that that's my brother he talks like that he writes like that I and and he was he did a tremendous service and I guess I Wonder I Wonder did the time out loud\nWould you have the courage to say my brother is doing something really terrible that's taking people's lives I'm going to turn him in\nAnd I know the result of my turning a man is going to send them to prison I I don't have any doubt in my mind I Would do that if a family member was doing such as that but I Wonder if there are other people who would say no I just don't want to know about it and I and I don't want to be responsible for sending my\nMy brother to prison for the rest of his life\nYeah when you look at the circumstances don't forget how many people were named and injured\nOn ... ... when they realize too was that was on his brother's mind his brother talked about that that that ... you know he felt so guilty but it took so long to figure out who it was but as soon as he sold the manifesto he took tournament\nAnd here's here's the other question I Know that let's say we find out I I put up a few possibilities on our Twitter pulled tonight is it the left is it the ride is it because of the election is it a garden variety nut case or is it a foreign factor it is beginning to sound like a garden variety nut cases based on the way they are because\nGary for what little we know about Iran's talking to Gary burned who's the author of secrets of the secret service in crisis of character I'm a ... a piece of pie in manila envelope that doesn't even you know conceal it weighed or its eyes were in shape seems almost designed to be identified easily\nAnd now that we're finding out the or the CNN device was not even a real explosive device although some of these were they at least had the components to go off but none of them did go off\nSo does our ... if if\nDevice all those some of these were they at least had the components to go off but none of them did go off\nSo desert you if if this was a garden variety nut case he said I'm going to make something that looks like a bomb it'll scare people have to death but I don't want it to go off I don't want it to maim or kill people and I wanted to be fairly quickly and readily identified\nAnd the amount of tape he used on those bombs on the packages I'm willing to bet the FBI is going to find fingerprints DNA and all kinds of things is is somebody who's saying I Want to be caught and I want to be identified\nYeah the the and also something else or you just pointed out um you know it it did he used that that's a that's a sign of a mental condition\nI'm ... years as an issue it's almost like being compulsive where they put so much Tejpal on it that's that's not a real bomb builder that somebody who's

I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nAnd simply this bit of audio and video but this audio free who listen to your list that radio from President\nObama\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who fed or the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law or and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected fund documented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the becomes immigrants in this country\nThere you go that is it that\nI agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nUh you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan of slowly moving across Mexico won't be here and time for the uh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens\nThey're stopping of bookies in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes\nUm but as we have said this is the time\nA couple of weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this is the Democrats now to the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge the Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what\nI Believe and so to the American people that you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically mhm\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plant\nAnd we've talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got bad than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it\nLike we all believe that your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell that to the American people that's what I think the president should say that he's already halfway there with this yep you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many more yeah hello see right\nThat sounds really over the last Twenty years and sound exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly play those make the comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is a press fact checking to make sure that\nObama really said that or they just laying low\nChallenged the press go after the media right so this is what they why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think down what they thought then why did you why don't you ask them if they want to open border\nIt's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating on me for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with ah with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I go to the moderator I'll do my time if I can just ask ask my opponent what they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people and that's basically what we have now I mean ... sealed we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion there is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you don't even force right\nIt's about time after Thirteen Years Thirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy when that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy\nWhen that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge him to death for them to tell the American people and don't stop it you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted\nTo make immigration illegal

don't remember ever getting\nAnd probably ... I remember putting on the one of the plastic basques with the little string\nBut I don't remember what the what are the only thing I remember wanting to be is again remember a hobo mhm you just take the stake in the little thing and you put them behind and you put shark book charcoal on your face but I was a which is that politically incorrect you can't use charcoal\nWhile it was to make it was if you had like a beard you might get like you had to be here like if I like uh like it was a five days growth as if\nYou know they shave every five days ... exam on but now that politically incorrect you can't go as as a no\nA temporarily displaced or maybe permanently displaced Traveller\n[laughter]\nAway word uh what about the the you know typically when I see at at my door on a on Halloween is do these days is superhero\nYou know or\nThe the you know the little girls will wear like a you know like a butterfly costume that's actually one of my granddaughters is going is she's got this really cool butterfly costume that she was going as above\nMy my grandson's going as a um a pumpkin his dad and I are trying to make it an evil pumpkin but his mom was fighting me on that\nSo you know she just wants a regular pumpkin ... is a next Wednesday that or is it yeah yeah\nYeah well that I I've got to go to sleep all my lights nobody pop it in my neighborhood you turn the lights off nobody bothers you Mad Men that's about ... and and I was a code\nI mean I I Love every ... ... if ah the Halloween wound up once every ... or ... or five years ... I'm On the friday and Saturday Night I stay home I Love it\nAnd I and I saw now some towel and like a friday night because of leap year Iranians wanting to announce she's of that you write that blows that so I mean one mhm\nUh but I I Love it and I am I absolutely love I've got grandkids now so it's just this great the you know the kids and the kids on especially in the weekend they come to the doors mean they'll come and to find a clock at night and and I just love it but I did see the stories where some towns\nAre threatening to rest to teenagers to see that who who tricking treat or trick or treat\nLike an age limit yeah be an age limit that's you can't do that sorry and and I'm thinking\nWho tricking treat or trick or treat like an age limit yeah be an age limit that's you can't do that sorry and and I'm thinking\nI don't care if the older kids come to my dad I really don't care I'm I don't hear all of a sudden you'll you open the door especially like at nine nine thirty a little bit later it's a bunch of high school kids yeah\nI think that's fantastic yeah my neighbor Bob came over he's eighty six I gave him [laughter] he was dressed ... van\n... every year it's like the neighbor skipped to get hired who's running out of candy and you got ... got to bail out what on ever running out of candy\nI I I get but I mean I always buy weight while I don't even end up closing the door I end up sitting out on the porch and the neighbors come over and it's just a great time and I don't carry you'll have you'll you'll have in the high school kids come out a little bit later and and but everybody is done by nine thirty ten\nWe um we we we kind of have a it depends on you know again if it's a weekend or not my granddaughter's\nOr we'll go to you know we'll go to their house and walk with them and the neighborhood sometimes I it just depends on what they're doing you know they're getting older now my oldest granddaughter is Thirteen so you know I'm I'm not even sure she's going to want to go trick or treating I have no idea they love dressing up though I mean they're they have a lot of fun doing it\nWell it but but then we come home and then you know that's it's like whatever time it is if it's not too late and then we hand out candy so changes when you have grandkids well you know it's like when when we talked about this before when well you know seven or eight\nYear olds and defining their sexuality and we're like excuse me when I was eight years old the only thing I cared about was candy I did hear the Seinfeld bit on candy just a couple of weeks ago again\nAnd that was my life my life revolved around candy and I didn't care about the Halloween costume\nRight would go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen can go read co op too I we we we've had Fifteen blocks I'd come home with grocery bags of candy and even at that age and all I cared about was the candy costume could care less yeah socializing could care less mhm get me the candy\nYeah right so of course that's my that's that's my tendency now we used to take a and it's now is you know the high blood sugar I've got to stay away from candy penance for being evil as we would use pillow cases [laughter]\nAnd I think we were poor because they were bigger [laughter] no they they were stronger yeah they could hold [laughter] that's right yeah I never ...\nI still do I don't have those on my bed I had a hello can build with candy it's much\nMuch better if that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity I'd be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween [laughter] and they have a bag huge back I that I think that's a good idea\nYeah yeah it's it's it's I remember one time when my son but it was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen\nAnd he and his buddies ah had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and they we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm is really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases down in the driveway we're only about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone and the boys were just so disappointed so was my son and two buddies I said\nAll right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king sized pillow cases and we didn't walk we drove I said we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys tell me\n[laughter] and I felt the pillow cases that night and it was one of the greatest nights number that's why we had been very much like minded way yes well I I I was just you know of wondering now can you where is it\nIs it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom masks are outnumbered the the the George W mass or out during that time on Iran resident there's a lot of them I mean you're probably still see Nixon mask\nYeah but I mean I have not seen a ...\nYou know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask [noise] I don't think I ever saw one has ever Reagan mess you know that it was rabid\n... there was Carter you know because of the big tea I remember that [laughter]\nI don't think there was a general math\nSo screaming shouldn't a wire we discriminating against secular I'd a very mundane around long time ago now I don't remember the next ... everybody remembers the Nixon ... oh yeah Robert Johnson [laughter] ... yeah I bet not have to watch point\nMember of the next ... everybody remembers the next ... oh yeah Robert Johnson [laughter] ... yeah I bet not\nHave to watch point break and we didn't mention [laughter] we we didn't we didn't mention Clinton because of course there was yeah there was going on in a house yeah yeah so I'm trying to think I think there was a I don't know if there was a Hillary mask of ... not that she was president but you know of course being first lady I have seen the Trump in\nA T shirts or it's a pumpkin with oh yeah yeah yeah right right yeah which is actually pretty funny which is pretty funny but then again would you where would you wear that out or when people get ticked off there\nAre people that sensitive and okay ... okay that I live out of the under the humor where somebody would actually get beat up for wearing that it'll be interesting to see if you hear stories of that where people refuse to give candy to a kid dressed as Trump because by the way it could go either way\nRight yeah I mean a baby dressed as Trump Baby Trump would be kind of funny\nCute

especially given the one\nSeat margin\nOf Republicans\nAnd this is going to be another\nAnother big big battle and uh it's it's it's one of those things that is a that is spreading and what they're

everything you will get that as well\nBut if you haven't been ... you try it lenses are always\nAlways odd sale\nOkay ah ah my friend ah at eight minutes after the hour of seven o'clock hey yeah how about a flashback\nYes than he is heading east heading the new Connecticut foundation solutions in them that he company\nCreated by state lawmakers which will oversee\nThe distribution of one hundred million dollars in state bonding twenty million a year for the next five years as well as an estimated eight point five million\nTo nine million in annual proceeds from the new twelve and you'll surcharge\nOn Connecticut homeowner's insurance policies\nThat surcharge is supposed to last for ten years\nThe new ... the company is expected to be up and running November fifteenth at the earliest or possibly around December first began cutting checks\nBut again the estimates roughly one hundred and thirty three point five million dollars committed over five years we'll cover the cost of replacing foundations for only six hundred and fifty\nTo seven hundred homes considering the average one hundred and eighty five thousand dollar cost per home\nMr Carlos says five thousand to nine thousand homes will have to be fixed\nOver the next few years and that includes homes with the most severe cracking and deterioration\nThis is part of the plan\nPart of the plan and uh once again it's going to happen this is what everyone is saying\nBut again I think that uh my ... my girl is he was correct and doing what he did getting all of the funds to gather and what it is going to cost us all it will happen\nThere's no question about that but it's going to happen at one hundred and eighty five thousand dollars per home and we're talking five thousand to nine thousand homes\nAnd you know when you think of of this and what it's going to put families through it's going to be probably one of the most a\nSerious plan that we have done in years here in the state of Connecticut\nJust think about it twenty million a year for the next five years as well as an estimated eight point five million to nine million in annual proceeds from a new twelve and you will surcharge\nOn all of our homes as far as the insurance policies are concerned\nThe surcharge is supposed to last as I mentioned earlier ten years so it says something that the Connecticut is going to have to do and I think we can do\nIt's a going to be something that we didn't think of but thankful we are to a Michael McGuire hours and ah\nAnd uh we didn't think of but thank bull we aren't you a Michael McGuire hours and ah he says and he is certain\nThat it can be done but you know he was honest\nAnd he laid it right out to us as far as how much it was going to cost you know would this all happened and it took so long and I will never forget when we made our first visit and saw\nSeveral of the homes in the money that they had put into it the families and what they had gone through\nAnd now there's going to come a time\nThere is going to uh come a time when there's a\nWhen this all when this all starts\nIt is twenty three minutes after the hour of seven o'clock and let's go to a Rob in something to Rob good morning good morning\nGood morning your morning gentleman hey listen we still don't know what their shirts commissioner signed off on this to look through your shirts companies walk away from this problem do\nWe really don't so again the politicians are still not telling us the truth and spending our money ...\nAgain this is a under this is under Michael regardless\nAnd ah it is a a separate separate type unit he's heading the new Connecticut federation of solutions in Denver the\nCompany does has a new company created by state lawmakers are great ... we're going to have [laughter]\nI I Want to see what they do have a another bureaucratic system to work through it was not going to help these people and it's not helping me in in our fellow citizens at all because we still don't know the truth as to what and who signed off on this and why\nWell this is ... I I think the study has been done though when you stop to think about it Rob\nWell okay we know the problem but why did they sign off on it why were the your shirt companies ... go of their responsibility for this\nWell they insurance companies haven't been let go of what's happened is that they have joined the new Connecticut\nFoundation solutions in them that he that is a separate company from insurance companies that they've got to they've got to do something like this so that the ... the work can be done that is that is the uh that is the the the whole mission here\nI agree the work has to be done absolutely bread but we need to know why they signed off why the insurance commissioner alleviated the insurance companies from this year's ago remember you you've\nGot your wired we want to hear the ... we were there when it started I ... in ... you're not something I Am surprised\nI Am surprised that we came this far and then we're going to do it I at one time honest to God I didn't think they were going to do it and I write and I and I had seen some of these homes that I couldn't believe what these families were going through I just couldn't\nWrite well governor Malory in and governor oh an explanation about the insurance commissioner on this issue and we're never going to get it and again politician's walk away with their retirement and leave us with a bag to pay its the scale\nOf what ... what I I just wanted to say what you must have some idea yourself so similar things ... we've got to do something Rob we can't leave them like this\n... [laughter] it's not like my ... um [noise] bread I agree we do have to do something and we are\nBut we need to know why this went this situation became this problem why aren't the insurance companies why were they let go three years ago for their responsibility on this and they were ... shirts commissioner allowed to sign off on this\nAnd we cannot find out who signed a document\nWell really the way they have this worked out now yeah it has to be done and it's going to be and they were honest it's going to be a billion dollars\n[laughter] that's great editor the Twenty one and a half trillion we're already in this country right or the four point seven billion I mean they're just sticking it to us time and time again bread\nBut you know something is don't you don't you understand as far as the as the other the other side I mean can you imagine did you did you ever visit one of these places\nNo no I wouldn't want to have to be a nightmare situation\nWell this is what I'm saying we've got to do something and I think after going over all the information that we received the insurance companies are still going to be in\nAnd I think after going over all the information that we received the insurance companies are still going to be involved it's the Connecticut foundation solutions in them that the company\nOkay it's going to have a a chairman and I mentioned uh uh who he is a Michael McGuire hours\nAnd he said he hopes to secure funding and assistance to help the thousands of affected homeowners from various sources and I lift lifted the ... the sources are going to be a a insurance industry the insurance industry will be involved banks\nU.S Department of housing and urban development federal emergency management agency and the state of Connecticut though I like to\nSee the breakdown of the expenses who's paying what that's for sure but I doubt that will get a true transparency\nIt but you understand what this whole plant is that we're going to do it\nI understand we're going to do it but I don't see where we're going to get all the money from but I understand we have to do it and I agree we have to do and where the need to be done now for these people\nAnd that was the uh and that is the reason that are that they're that they're going to do it this is a when I went over this information I said my God oh my God a and this gentleman forty two year veteran of the insurance industry that hello there working\nYou're Warner gentleman hey I've got a a few things I'm sure you know I guess for for the ah the mentioned and benchmark were\nYeah you're breaking up and go\nOh joke cause back buddy Joe log got to get a call back there Joe it where he started he did and and the signal dropped out\nWell maybe somebody thought he was a national wanted to just get rid of him you know that that have happened to have these laws and here's the\nHere ... ears the um\n[noise] now see this is [laughter]\nI just looked up the word now how these things are twisted\nIn society [noise] and you look up nationalism here here are some of the here's some of the phrases ... nationalism [noise]\nPatriotic feeling principals or efforts towards such a advocacy of Political Independence for a particular country\nA an extreme form ... says an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries while you know what in many ways in many ways not all in many ways America is in fact superior over other countries\nI Want to ask you a question yeah why do people want from us yeah why do they want that promotes here's a nightmare for all to them here's an idea if this\nPlay style hope this person's listening you know bought out the the you know got got the Nazi crackers open this morning\nAt this place is so awful why do millions of people still trying to come here at the drop of a hat\nBrat I talked to people not the people who show up for these rallies\nHow evil America is an anti ...

too I mean you know the reason we're we're the greatest country in the world is is because we're so generous and we care about yeah you know other countries I mean who is the first country anybody calls and there's a natural disaster yeah yeah my ... and those\nWho show up with the navy so they could supply power in Ireland to get blown out or you know why don't you have the time you know I'm sure it's industry stuff you know I I I suspect it all has to do your economics\nYou know if if if it was just wrong on the on the insurance company does not you know\nThere might be you know hundred insurance ... throughout the whole state going like maybe twenty of them are concentrated in that area yeah it was twenty we're responsible for all that all the ... you know all that pay back\nThey got business plus you have to check your rates up astronomically to everybody else so much that he you know spreading the welcome supporting the pain\nI think that's what this is doing it's pretty much okay everybody has some skin in this game everybody after help out you know and also they got you know funding sources from from national places you know the uh you know the federal government and everything so you know that I mean I could be completely wrong\nBut that's you know that that's what I think\nIt's a tough call on any endless and yet the outlay is if these insurance companies had endless listen they're going to be people that are gonna you know argue that they should take more of a part in this was the outlay would be huge money and then but you know what then you have a scenario people dealing with this would say well what's what's what's the use of having insurance then\nEither yeah yeah yeah well\nThis is going to have just innately as I explained it a a Connecticut foundation solution in ... the company now it's made up of\nSome of the insurance companies banks U.S Department of housing and urban development is it's going to be a plan\nAnd are looking at it and everything else we're going to do it and it's going to it's going to cost us some money there's no there's no question uh there's no question about it but the\nIt'll be a twelve dollars annual surcharge on Connecticut homeowner's insurance policies ... yards is going to supposed to last for ten years well\nThat that that part I doubt but here you know how that goes but you know it's to me it's a small price to pay 'cause also if if if those people are or you know just aren't you know funded or don't get their ... don't get their foundations facts they're just going to walk away from their homes\nYou know and on and then the bank and then the bank and the banking on them that's right yeah\nThat that's not going to be able to sell them on ... you know completely ruined the town's economy to show you know\nI think you know sending this plan a I'd they\nThey've got to figure it out and it's you know and we'll ... we'll be following it there's no question about it but thank God we're doing something yeah yeah\nAnd it's one of those things where it's the least worst solution which it sucks but you know it it it could be worse it could be other you know other

I've adapted to it you know\nBut you know wonderful thing as far as I here I Am next to you yeah listening and what it must have done for that listener that yeah that's how I look oh there's there's there's what that must have done to that if you're that list there when you told her yeah what you went\nThrough yeah and and and then there are there are as you well know you've you've talked about this obviously we listeners for years and had guess there are you know\nMillions and millions of people who are diabetic in pre diabetic and Brad\nListen it all comes down to it comes down to our diets you know what we've eaten and lack of exercise so you know I'm scrambling and trying to make up for that now but you know they're listening there are people that to me I have a I I'm ... I'm right on the border line now of being normal versus you know diabetic so like\nYou know my doctor's notes on doctors happy but there are people that you and I both know that there are people that have to use insulin every day that happened you know it's it's a real hassle yeah yeah but\nYou know when you stop to think about yeah up in the morning there you know you're working a yeah you're out you do you do the are you do the hockey player at ... I mean come on here and I've\nLearned over the years and then and there's people who who have this will attest ... you know again things affect like fatigue workload how much sleep you get I mean that that's the thing I've learned over the years is that you know with with my relatively minor situation than other things having talked to my doctors and really talk to other experts [noise]\nHow much Brad of how we feel and our physical wellbeing is connected to just getting a decent night's sleep\nIs is just is just a bread I can tell you there have been weeks where because of my schedule you know I I'd had and I I I've tried to cut back on those a lot but there have been weeks where you know I'll only get like four hours the night's sleep because I'm running around like crazy\nAnd and that the end of a three or four days stretch I shot forget it I mean physically you know bloated my legs hurt and everything and then all of a sudden you say okay the next two days I'm going to do nothing but sleep at at the end of those two days I feel like a new person\nYou know and and you might laugh because people do and what I Do mentioned that yeah but I Will tell you one of the greatest things\nYou know and and you might laugh because people do what I Do mention it yeah but I Will tell you one\nOf the greatest things that ever happened to me\nWas joining the marine corps yeah because the first thing yeah and you never forget it ... they say you got to do this you have to do this and they'll tell you what you're doing wrong the hole and it stays with you yeah yeah yeah and getting up early yeah who in the ... you know and it it's uh it's\nAmazing yeah yeah and so so when you know ... over the past eight ten years I've learned some regimented things that I on my own way try to stick to you know I ... and my perfect all the time no not really but who is you know I Can't do push ups that you do in the morning and all that you\nIf you said drop and give me twenty I give you one [laughter] I'll give you I'll give you on there\nUm boy I'll tell ya on unreal no BRIC already minutes after the hour of the eight I think it'd\nBe a twenty uh gives you time check therefore yeah I'll give you one I'll get half oh excuse me he can he can do half a push up I can do one maybe two if you held a gun to my head I ... to now I now what was the most now when you when the core family yeah\nWhen you were in the physical condition how many pushups kids rattle off do you remember\nThe the the time that I got the most of them yeah okay yeah uh it was a forty one okay that's not bet wow wow\nAnd that was every day yeah you had to do you know watch what they did in the ... they would say OK down yeah the push up yeah and then if you wanted to show off a little bit really there was the worst mistake\nI ever made because that's the push up that you were doing for\nNot at all so in other words if they do it was like oh you're D I expected you to do that every ... yeah the man David out today let's Davis let's go you know I was just trying to address or say why wouldn't get kicked out of the core of before I even graduated [laughter] it was unbelievable surprises so you asked yourself what the heck\nWas I thinking yeah they are but I'm Glad I did it yeah\nSo question or what what I mean what do you consider peak if I may ask what do you mean because I've got the average ... pushups very the average for what like the Marines or or one of the ... just going with the army physical fitness army physical fitness so is this what army\nThey ... they don't well they don't have the owner named all ... all around here we go don't mention army to ... to a retired Marine okay I'm going oh they don't have they will or not and the poor they don't they don't publish them or like no no the army asking for an average okay so the army so what do we think is what now for pushups so what would be the prime\nFor a crime by many years prime years if you're in the army what do they expect you to do [noise] thirty or Thirty years I'm thirty pushups\nSo in other words we're down here oh I see what you're saying okay so here it is so Brad if this is the army now it's not the morale goes that they had okay so Seventeen to Twenty one year olds and the army or they expect him to do thirty five push-ups\nTwenty two to twenty six year olds they expect to do thirty one\nTwenty seven to thirty one year olds they expect them to do thirty\nTo thirty to thirty six year olds and the army have to do twenty six and forty seven fifty one year olds they got to be behind a desk I Would think by them forty seven fifty one year olds in the army you're still expected to do twenty four really yeah see you Marines you\nThought the army was all out of shape [laughter] you know shape but it's a different signing it you you know you get off it short [laughter] that I Am a Marine Corps doesn't have\nOne lie to you know 'cause the court just knows they know in theory if they don't need the ... and if you you know I could tell your stories that I Can't ... the year can't\nUh but the main serious so we should use our imaginations you know in different ways that they do something wrong yeah ever call your rifle a God I have heard that story product it never called her the John So what you're saying is what you're saying Brad is that your drill instructor\nHow should we put this would have ways of of ah of getting his or his point across\nOh yeah yes and you'd never forget it again\nIt is Brad oh I'm bring that back up boy what are you going to bring that back up and Eric ... there's ... no stop at their the marine corps is considered one of the most physically demanding branches of the U.S military they go read\nAnd they're recruiting materials no it isn't for every one quote unquote there you go read it isn't that they tell you that in boot camp excuse me\nThey are recruiting materials no it isn't for every one\nUnquote there you go bread it is it did they tell you that in a boot camp excuse me they tell you that\nThat they say Hey David this is what you're reading right now they tell you that David surprise you found something that shows Eric our producer and he found it that's exactly what did they say you know Davis this isn't for every one did they tell you that\nWhen you were in the car they uh they did it in a different way let's put it that way\nYou know they say you could start yet with close to fifty yeah okay ... and you could graduate with how maybe yeah Nineteen or twenty so did they just had written platoon they tell you did did anyone at one time and say hey Davis\nYou're not hanging out with the cows and end field anymore today did did did did no no but they said things that I enrolled stretched show and their own special way that I really\nI have a question but I Know I I feel funny asking this one on one or I don't want to have to pay for an attorney or an elder care lawyer they're gonna charge me four or five hundred bucks an hour and I just have two questions so that that in of itself has got to be a great a great byproduct deer seminars\nYeah we we kind of laugh a lot because usually the way the the order of presentation is I'll go first funeral director second\nAnd then you have to turn his last one and what I joke about his his allies because everybody waits for him a lot of loyal either in LA and for the whole program because they really need to hear about what ... ... ... that's good showbiz once you're living in show business\nAlways always always had them hanging for more I could ride the bus ride yeah I Know this\nIs something to that uh I wanted to ask you and you have different\nTypes seminars or the dignity of life seminar now what is included in that now this is a November the eight or Mary our uh our queen of the church parish in ... that's from a\n... ... that's the eighth of November from two until six PM now what actually happens at a dignity of life semi what can you do\nSo um there's two presentations per day so there's one or two PM and there's another one at six PM ah for particularly for the one on November ... uh marry or queen of the church and a plants bill and what happens is\nThere's a slide presentation that's put together a for each of the people that I mentioned so myself will do a slide presentation talking about\nYou know what what's involved what's the process that family goes through when they're interested in talking about cemetery type products okay when they want to pick their final space yeah what what happens do you come inside do you know do you guys come\nTo our home how how does it all work how big of a big of a plot do I have to pay where can I get to age as me and my wife and my husband what about my kids right yeah there's a lot of questions\nThat we will kind of try to answer and going through this process and we talk about the costs and we talk about a more importantly I think than anything is the family services advisors in and explaining to families how they are there\nTo help them on an individual basis through every step of the process and that's been a great benefit not only to the archdiocese but mainly for the families of the archdiocese because they know they have someone that they can turn to not only for the timeframe that they're working with setting up their own um\nRequirements but also anytime afterwards if there's a question if there's some they have a friend that they have somebody that needs more information they know they have someone that they know they can trust they can come through and get all these questions answered\nSo and not only is it the cemetery but the same thing with the funeral directors attorneys you know we all were there to help educate people and really give them a good understanding of all the issues that they are going to have to deal with and we also give them the resources necessary so that down the road\nIf they choose to make these decisions they know who to go to and they get everything taken care I Want to give the telephone number sure\nI'll never forget I'll never forget the first few days I was giving this number and that was one of the easiest one of the easiest that you ever had to give eight hundred vibe zero five zero zero eight zero eight hundred\nVibe zero five zero zero eight zero and you can call anytime anytime anytime so our offices are open\nFrom um eight o'clock in the morning before in the afternoon but even if you call afterwards there's going to be uh\nYeah so our offices are open from um eight o'clock in the morning before in the afternoon but even if you call afterwards there's going to be a a place that you can leave a message and guarantee you that you'll get a call back within twenty four hours\n[noise] now how long\nHas this been going and what has been the motivation because I you know we talked about it when we first met that is this going to work is this going to have a well people you know so I think people want to meet somebody and to just ... yeah yeah yeah\n[laughter] well it it's true and you don't want to find him in surprising is I drive through the cemeteries in the morning um [noise] you know there's people there and I'll stop and see folks and say Hi how are you you know can I help you is anything anything that you need\nAnd it's amazing how people just want to have a conversation and it's not necessarily because they're interested in you know buying anything or you know but they just want to park\nThere in this environment it's peaceful it's pleasant they might just be taking a walk you know and they feel like they want to have a conversation about these issues so for us I I think that's a\nA significant factor in what the archbishop was thinking when he started this program so\nIt's only been in existence for three years\nAnd it has been a a phenomenal success in terms of helping families and I think that's really what he envisioned to to give a resource to the families so that this doesn't\nBecome such a taboo item in people's minds that they can now say that's a key yeah you know we're not afraid anymore to talk about it because we can talk to people who are here on a nice folks you want to help us through what's\nYour question what is the what is the um haven't grown up in the Catholic Church I you know ... been through cemeteries and and and and and funeral services all my life family members what is the current state if you will of\nSpace in Catholic cemeteries you know you always some people may be the oldest of space contract I might have to have lots of burial may have to go to a mausoleum in the cemetery or or you know maybe we should consider a you know we we we should consider ... other things cremation our white is your land crunch for some of these cemeteries are not\nSo the state of Connecticut we're very fortunate and the archdiocese that some we're a long long time ago uh people were very prescient about what the needs would be for the families in the state so we're fortunate that we have plenty of land because okay we'll be able to continue to service the families for\nLong long past our lifetimes grandchildren's life ...

substantive way that you stand with North Dakota and with President Trump when he is right for North Dakota\nAnd of course she not only did she fought against the confirmation of of a great judge who's by the way very good for North Dakota or many of his his opinions and dissent a defense became of course the majority opinion and the Supreme Court\nOver things like EPA overreach and\nAnd in many areas what land water air a just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit\nAnd so she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and she blows it by voting against him

courageous\nA mile still still has that frontier feeling on the ... not very populist a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair\nAnd I think most people just that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and [noise]\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just put up with the cabinet I think because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she's really big but also she's a former state attorney\nPretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him\nAnd believed a progress report then she didn't believe him but believe professor port and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor\nYou know just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed because everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit the rug in this\nThey frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era then media has had a ... mirror\nUm I think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just ... the frenzy and fury and upset and and the last always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but I think people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never\nSatisfied with they get one thing and they say okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be health care for illegal immigrants\nThan a one lesson that you you know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um congressmen in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy [noise]\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and I you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is let's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states\nWill show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but\nBut because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored you know\nStates' rights and and that's what ... what a gimmick but cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find the federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these sun packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but\nMy my main thought his let's please not jump to conclusions let's you know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see where all of this leads before we create something\nDifferent than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on on our own individual behavior and what contribution if any we make to this this discourse that's going on this\nIt's always a good opportunity for self reflection on on our own individual behavior in what contribution if any we make to this this discourse

spoken out and and given a speech to the nation and that's why\nThe president immediately came out and condemn this and said we have to come together as a country but it doesn't mean that you're going to stop campaigning we have to come together around the idea that political differences\nShould not in any way a lead to this type of outrageous criminal behavior\nBut it's not that we're going to suddenly unite behind all of everyone's going at the same view on immigration everyone's going to have the same view on trade it's ridiculous course not how it works\nAll obvious from the same person what what is your intent do you think you're going to help\nTrump and do you say oh you're going to help Donald Trump will right before a mid term election area was it just makes no sense\nSo if you

I'm assuring all these progressive into power and the Senate unseat in\nA conservative US Senators and winnings maybe sixty seats in the house I again I don't know what's going to happen in the house Republicans are probably gonna pick up a couple of seats in the Senate at least they could pick up four seats in the Senate at that would be amazing\nBut they they assume that was going to happen because they assume that everyone agrees with whatever said in some air conditioned beautiful gleaming studio in Manhattan because if it's set on MORNING Joe then it must be a it must be a view held by most Americans\nWill they don't understand that most Americans aren't the audience of Morning Joe or any of these other shows that nobody watches\nMost America as most Americans are smarter than

and I think this is a a left wing conspiracy I mean because nine inner bombs\nYou know what better way is sending all the prominent Democrats\nAnd I you know and I'm just speculating but it just kind of makes sense I don't put it beyond them at all\nI don't know I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the truth is I I Do know that\nWe should wait until we have actual information\nAbout what this is [noise]\nUh you're listening to your health a radio station a five five forty lost\nA lot more to say [laughter] [noise] Mm\n\n[noise]\nThe following is not a doctor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nGoing to be real devices or you don't use timers just send it through the mail you're going to use\nA victim actually the device or something like the FedEx FedEx bombs um that took place and not too long ago [noise] um so\nThose those are the turn of the things that we're looking at I'm In my office here as a some indicators of this is a functional device or non functional device them with the X ray coming out at least of one of the delays I Can't speak to all of them but at least one of them know you'll get non functional devices here just to instill fear in people\nWell it seems again that we have a very odd\nAnd yet obvious kind of list of people from a political standpoint all of them are critics of the president or all of them outspoken critics and the president of course President Obama and so forth but does that\nTell us anything the kind of obvious nature of this last [laughter]\nYeah I I mean I guess that speaks to uh some some motives behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news that's on there on the TV right now this is the rate at the front view of everybody right now\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish here what they're trying with ideologies are trying to push for it but the bottom line is there's a clear cut a destruction of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish who the person did it\nOr not to get away all the investigative techniques but I mean right up right up front you'd be looking at a fingerprint analysis from the tape of device or\nUm you know the other other um modalities that you can use to to get um DNA evidence off of off of the device if if in fact it was left I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile um\nUh item there are especially since this wasn't render safe by a I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to this um which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a ah they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps when actually stamped salvo hot\n[laughter] yeah it is odd and you would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person you know who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nThere has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up where they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb like this through\nThe postal service because it's too easily detected us or anything to that\n[laughter] well I mean if you looked or you know historical data the uh bombs have been put use you know through the mail um\nEspecially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what he did as a result the Unabomber stuff I mean you can use the the post office or you use other areas means of uh\nA courier service FedEx or whatever but I think in the day you're not going to use what they used in the last few days but you're going to use something that's not detectable um look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we had were the the devices actually went off\nUm those were intended to go off these ah these are intended to be found in my opinion they were meant to instill fear in people that's the bottom line there are ... and again that is just my opinion\nUh Brian Morris uh Ryan we appreciate your insights here and we'll bring you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on this issue with these ah know that there are terrorists or they're ... they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their though if they didn't achieve the goal of violence however they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people and they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah and get attention a and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know\nAnd dominate the news ah and get attention and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what went down a with a lot more to get through on the lower income show the campaign\nOr is heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum

land developer turns out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him and it looks like he had\nYou know walked right into the trap and I thought he could get away with lying about it I don't I don't\n... to me this whole thing is very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits uh from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother

why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course a should also not be a Republican strong conservatives\nAre and what what Indiana's think today\nExcused ... excuse me for the Democrats are incumbents that and I said governor I'm so our governor on my mind a so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race\nBut I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break a five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political timing is very strange and a lot more coming up\n\n\n\n\nSo I'm sure honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract before the next set of fees contact resort released today\nOr we could feel a big boost and I think that's been built into a lead that's helped us here and you don't have the one in North Dakota and Missouri and we feel real good about it a momentum uh everything on our side and I really believe are going to win\nSo your opponent says like well he supports Trump to does he\n[laughter] only on the stuff that doesn't count a [laughter]\nAnd voted against tax reform and you know it was for Obamacare all this stuff is really important [noise]\nHe's a hundred percent lined up with Chuck Schumer and the liberal side of his party and that record being fully flushed out a chair a through this campaign and that's the reason we're going to win it ah with or without the capital\nYou know bomb but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we're resource to competitively in great fundraising and\nNot a whole lot different than executing a business plan and uh we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or and what what is your take on this that the criticism of the president it was almost incense even though he condemned this of course and asked for national unity it was not good enough or and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere\nThat resulted in these uh packages being sent\nOn the president's been blamed for everything gets knowing knowledge but for the main thing is done on the reason I'm running is uh I wouldn't be running for ah invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity\nTo kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh hey they're still re litigate again I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets\nA no credit for the great agenda that's out there that are exciting who's yours and uh he was popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style\nAre going to look at the results and uh\nI think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to become so Trump for you when you don't eat our um you know he's been always with the liberal side of his party's so um I think this is just another example of\nHow they try to distract than a give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening [noise]\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence we're seeing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after Steve ... was almost killed\nAt the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and so everyone seems to forget what happened in fact I was in fact one of the security there would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it's\nAnd there's supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened if that guy was inside of the security there would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it's a litany of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the cabinet hearings and all of its challenging Democrats and these red states or the amount of just absolute negative lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packs dump into George Soros and the rest of 'em uh\nI think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message\nCompletely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda and I think voters are going to hold him accountable uh I think ah the Kavanaugh hearings for Hoosiers would have been part the point where\nOur race changed and many others I think enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others I saw something Fox stares on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped you on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nOf proposals to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity earned forced the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade\nHe won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure you know the Affordable CARE Act or the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail but good yeah big government hooked up with big healthcare is specifically insurance and I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd Lara held premiums flat\nFor ten years and then the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually might have a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was\nA made up consumer driven made a transparent\nThe kind of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the Senate I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race that gets a guy like Joe Donnelly been spent a career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progress the results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on the heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like some of like a John Case that coups forever\nBack on his heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives a less crazy any calls or not and and I think it's a little ... pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean a thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm or the other thing you're going to get as if agenda really heals and I talk about tax reform but I Do think it's a combined upon conservatives in the business owners now\nThat you've got more Django in your pocket share it with your employs we've done that by further lowering healthcare costs that after keeping them flat for ten years and I've preached out all the time but you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated within ten months people now adding up more money on their own pocket and if you get business owners like us\nThat ... gone out there in touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employs people quit looking to the\nFalse hope of the federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really has put us on the brink of a financial calamity if we don't get more\nPeople in there they're going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going you know there'll be more of us I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and join the Trump trains so\nWhat ... well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race or the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls vote for in advancing economy and an America that's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go\nSeeing economy a dead end America that's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass ... illegal immigration\nGot to deal with this with a new Congress close these loopholes and Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're going to win this Mike and I'm I'm so glad we're in\nWe're going to win it than that I'm looking forward to it nah Laura thanks for the support and we're going to finish a art in the paper on the sex and uh can't wait to be a reinforcement for a great agenda

I just I wanted to get your pay can see\nYou know something personally in baby steps to you know when my\nWife and I talked about a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency charmed by now I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here this Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo ah and I'm real careful on the show as you know or even through financial ... not recommend to people to do something I don't do that kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um and so a Christian healthcare ministries um the the\nYou know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it it all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or innocence becomes cooperatives day on his what it's doing 'em and uh the the you\nKnow I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nNow you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing family plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal\nYou know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered and what does not covered learn how it works um because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim\nSo it's worked for forty years you know I mean whatever number of years but decades dry as so uncomfortable with the credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in at number three the only way I'll do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... ...\nAnd it is a Christian healthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so the writing hardcore in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process or Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it's for an house laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question we were to go through that even baby steps to and all that kind of stuff one of the things that my wife with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking to the as the long term track record and and we're okay we're all the requirements we're now we're we're evangelical Christians and all that out of step and we're and we're normally pretty healthy seemed like a good fit for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you play out of pocket kind of like when ... and stuff so if you're a baby that you would you recommend it when they go that route\nTo set aside that they had a dollar to insulate you\nYou've gotta you've already got a liar you've already got a thousand in baby steps on so you're close enough\nI'm ... and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps to cover some bills if you had an event right Brian or it's just like carrying large the duck the boy as you said in and they just say or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone\nFor sure and I'm so forth but but yeah Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's

that and are there for future ah when my husband and I experimented with some other options over the years like dried out insurance and\nButter on me and some other thing but I'm I'm just kind of at a point where I Know that I Need to make have a good career path but I don't really know where to turn okay\nTwo quick questions first of all what is a financial target you have that you want to make

home and show and the Rachel proof show we're\nHere for you triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five to to find somebody who's the calls that you need some help you need some clarity today so they make a call now before we went to the break I told you that I had some shocking information Rachel I cannot I'm beside myself all the excitement to let you react to the\nPeople don't know that you and I love a good spirited public conversation you know whether it be politics sports wise we enjoy a\nGood ... if we have another radio show the weather ... revolves around money in Korea as attorney that we have a current event will be good so so is there was a current sir yes\nAll right now here's or at least set the scene as of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nIn America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars oh that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker\nAnd it's a small percentage but when you look at the total amount of Americans is gonna blow your mind and here are the basic freedoms here me when I say those folks basic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean aren't reading Hi Kelly here we go\n[noise] two point four percent of Americans that's about six million Americans\nGet don't they present it was like do like ... million so that they again six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if you took there [laughter]\n[noise] we have a\nLive studio audience in the lobby of a financial ... headquarters there shaking their head\nIlls that are really nice to be able yeah there's a guy out there with the Georgia had all I Know how you feel you know I get it okay freedom of speech meaning you can't say what you want that for about ... like the like beyond for breast okay\nHere's the deal Joe lunch pail will take away your debt you're sixty thousand dollars in debt the differences you can never express an opinion the rest of your life\n... we we would be ... what would happen to us skin that got put on [laughter]\nI Know what would happen to me I think I Would ... like I I Would go to jail for that anyway ... not be able to ... apparently they are not very opinionated people know\nWhat that's absurd ready for this is this takes the cake three point five million Americans right to cruise would go to jail ... they would give up all freedom\nNot just speech they would put all along they would pull on the orange jumpsuit and go to jail or they don't know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous\nThey would put on the orange jumpsuit and go to jail you know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking\nStyle you know go to Ralph around jail they would go to gym\nAll the way from your family you know not have the Freedom Riders you not suffering or wait for your family work and pay off debts you're just using that you're just like use all freedom you're ... food\nYeah now let's toast break this down for a minute we're having fun with this but but I I I Want you to jump in on this\nSo these are people there's there's three point five million Americans who are going I don't want to sacrifice cable t._v. I don't want to sacrifice going out on an as a vice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my F. two fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt today rand's these baby steps in civil point I Want to go to jail\nI'll go to jail before that ... or ... or a three point five million dollars who have not heard of the baby says that snowball and they just truly I've lost all hope\nThat they will never ever ever ever got out of it you just hit the point they've lost out so they think I'll go to jail\nAnd then when I get out of jail I don't have any data that 'cause they ... I I Want to believe and my the glass as half full cut that there is wandering lasted ... up that's not right you want to have full I can I ask George again without opinion guy what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and look to the sky shit I what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes\nThat three point five million Americans this is an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that that is but the sad thing is that they I'd rather like that they've just up that they don't think you're ... you're exactly right I Hope\nI Hope that someone that I think one doesn't say I would rather\nNot I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable and you know I don't think so I mean\nI think it's limited and it's like murder she wrote for Thirty years ago so here's the fourth day Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy that but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic ...\nWe've got a plan is called Dave baby steps total money make over walk you through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show do that every scream\nWell and on this show and and the right to Chris shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ever oh have you listening to what you it's it's everyday\nAverage American that's where it is people don't make crazy income they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are every day people choosing something different ... and that's it you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do\nDrink doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[laughter] hey how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner school or see aren't a school we owe a hundred K. on her house worked at three otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school I could cash flow and worked full time through giant school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program in totality a but just prerequisites and and I could not work for the three years and the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a ... it's just the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things one issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answered is because there was a vantage than disadvantages um I don't think I Would take it away a yarn anymore right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call it the ...\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner okay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNow without going back to that tree or program and joins same prerequisites\nBut my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may pay your house often that time and so you can cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you twenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the ...\nThat as you move up the ladder how old are you twenty nine yeah I just\nWonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to cash from all that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\n\nOn really know what are you making now the\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much does that cost again you've had that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand correct oh\nYou could do it just started bumper salary honestly and go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back in a year so yeah Ken's right if you do that I Know ... that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said that you don't the cash for it so now don't go into the lung that for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you know July the warning offense that's an increase in income at least and yeah and then move into the school and a few years and\n... you know that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think where you pause you sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise] you can\nCash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do also or something that you're good at art folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day for him to show don't go anywhere [noise]\n\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raise a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna\nAnd they'll go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches in places that will have\nPeople in the family that need this specific health that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business you had that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's a ... so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there are but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five is the number of Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we help\n[noise] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on it I mean these are not for something else I'm On the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my a retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going all thirty five years and my only on\nA challenge or block is some convincing like hounding that's a good idea\nOn because it would be a bit of a difference and they are but there is about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking about on and helping people find Hong then ... on I find that really interesting okay\nPlease get excited thinking and on and how can people find Hong ... operating on I find that really interesting\nOkay not what I Love my teaching but it's just time for a\nJob I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay [laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you're still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before you retire without penalty\nClarify years okay I just want to throw scenario you want if over the next five years you build your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody that's ever been successful and real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me Rachel is that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollar that's just it's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of ... but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not\nMaybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\n... than a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is we get that the ... the busiest time and it's how\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old can that even go to five years if you can\nWhenever it isn't that we're in commitment of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person what you mean you're gonna be a great residents in Asia because most people do great when they have great people ... sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide ah and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent guess having a great run that age and your ... or anything about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell\nSuper fun versus going from where he learned that salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year he said\nAbout us and I think once you show the hubby replaces the twenty five right for all I Want to give you one reason why she go and

than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I Am looking into starting the baby steps and my concern is that I have a son who definitely soccer and that costs money it's not too expensive but I don't feel like pulling the rug out from under him just because I've made mistakes uh how would you suggest they handle that\n[noise] um what the select soccer cost\nIt only seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and that's when all of his um uniforms and everything\nIn your household income is what\nI'm just under a hundred thousand\nOkay and you I'm a U.S how much debt\nSeventy five thousand [noise] okay\nUm I mean it's not a deal breaker it's seven hundred and fifty dollars of the thing that Sharon and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to get our debt free go we had to find something else we're going to cut deeper\nOkay so like that means that if you were going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not gotcha\nOr the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and it's such a interested we're doing select soccer um and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or she sold the oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do right I'm with them in terms of uh\nYou know activities in sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in the journal right we're we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a future career for him\n... ...\n... is with us in Jackson, Mississippi hey Carl how are you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call I'm sure\nWell I think ... is that um there's three in the household my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago so mom I moved in with us [laughter]\nSo um she couldn't make it on her own so we just kind of combine our income um our monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars [laughter] I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWe're like forty seven dollars a month over budget as things stand now [noise] um\nWe had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that that is almost\nTwelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the old that the bank to far overdraft has to do that\nWhen it was a lot of the bank charge you\nFor drought this stuff so that I\nMean why why did the bank charge you anything if there was identity theft\nAnd be well it was a Cain was charged to our account\nTo know but if it's identity theft or bank shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it\nUh I can change banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed bank in it and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart hard you know we don't even go through the banks seem over ... it's just a debit card [noise] but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars and overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm\nBut down here in that time because that was going on we got a high end on our house payments\nAnd I'm ... thanks for the smaller and I think we had well we got the smaller and I said no we're still have a hand on our house I've got to the housing loan people and they're working with is that we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you going to\nThe the nine eight to nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine or\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nIt is the middle of the three of us\nAnd none of you were able to work\nNo I Do a little side business witchcraft and things like that\nWhat is the nature of your disability\nUm is a hip displacement what's wrong with him\nUm he had um as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nA says the bone and close to his nerves fact mhm and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago and he has a defeat the later and he's got like twenty five percent of his heart is beaten so\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crush us right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you're kind of started doing there with the crafts and even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing\nFor a quarter and a nickel and selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times I made like ten thousand dollars mhm okay and that\nDoesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it it really I guess or be dramatic and how old is mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty or forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah\nShe passes away you don't get a real problem correct so we've got to solve some of those income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nUm they were four Seventy eight they've increased to five and it was on one of\nThose on your land that's just due to taxes and insurance going up\n... now and wants to home worse [laughter] oh it's worth a shot at a hundred and ten hundred and twelve ... twelve five on it I don't want to go to this you know when it paid off sure would be good when you know so\nThink more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do\nA you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month\nWould change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change you feel like you were rich like you were multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nSomething it would change your life that much\nAnd so and is that possible yes that is possible\nIt's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on your physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation where the over the phone so you can have an intelligent conversation with somebody on the phone sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... your struggles because you're lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nAnd it would change everything for you and thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nAre and how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHow my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes are they're getting on dad what are we paid it off about ... ... and\nI'm Wondering and your eyes or your parents when from a financial perspective is a good time to start thinking about having kids because my wife's getting credit cushy and that is I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one that won a kid's faster than Sharon ... she won but I'm\nA I I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you you don't want to sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that's crazy but where are you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids and God says it's okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be the certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not\nThat is not devastating but again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children\nI mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape your financially smart you're already moving in the right direction you want to start now it doesn't bother me at all\nThis is Dave Ramsey show\nWell thank you I haven't done that don't have it keeps the honest it keeps you don't oh definitely yeah once you do that it's game on\nBecause you can't you can't not do the stuff and lead the glass and\nMake you a different kind of accountability yeah I just it didn't mean if you're a person of honor anyway you know again I wouldn't let me I guess you could go in there just lie but yeah it's it's just very hard\nWell

what's on your mind I just wanted to say that more than likely these weren't delivered by third party couriers writes anything any surveillance footage they would have what is the conclusive and I think more than likely will never find out where they came from because it's exactly what you're talking\nHang it in the air right to the election and the narrative will be oh those evil right wing yours will vote for Trump they even planted bombs you know all of the sacred characters of the left for all of our wonderful American patriots like a ...\nHussein Obama George Soros all these wonderful Americans were victimized by the evil right wing that's the narrative as an exact uh hey you go well doesn't fool me not for a second while we're almost\nAll we are out of of joy ...\nHere's the truth about most home security companies well they're like dealing with another bad you know old fashioned cable company\nHe how many housekeeper skinny have\nHow many gardeners can you need in Beverly Hills why does buried Dylan make believe he wants armies of illegal aliens coming into America does he think he's fooling\nHe's a brilliant man is a successful man he's a billionaire he's got everything in the world and his building by the way on the west side is one of the most beautiful buildings in Manhattan I remember when we were tied up at that dock couple of years ago and they got the big yacht\nI saw this most beautiful glass building and it was as I said boy this guy is really smart sees that smart why does he continue to pound the drum for open borders along with his good buddy Iraq Obama Bill Clinton George Soros and Jeff Zucker\nI Wonder if they actually meet somewhere at some kind of dark restaurant\nAnd have some kind of meeting I mean in my if I'm One of his the dark corners of the of the media and a right wing or as they say that I should think that there's a secret meeting of a cabal of Obama Clinton a dealer and all of the left they meet somewhere I don't believe they actually meet somewhere\nTrump supporters chat lock her up the same day Hillary Clinton was sent the pipe bomb okay Newsweek conservative commentators Michael ... New York magazine who's ignored me for twenty five years even though I'm Wondering how often they are you know most of the people who write for New York magazine aren't even from New York\nThat's the irony I actually was born in how many people are right for New York magazine are actually born in New York I don't know they're probably from somewhere else I Would think\nSo now New York magazine a ... you know they weren't that bad as as prominent conservatives think the bomb scares are liberal hoax so that's almost neutral in in the way they did it\nThen a Newsweek says Michael Savage the conservative house at least they had at least they're polite about it and reasonably calling me the conservative host thank you\nThe radio show Savage Nation which has an audience of millions every which is all true\nBut at least they would dignified in their attacks Newsweek I got to give it to them New York Mac prominent conservatives think the bomb scares her liberal logs it somewhat\nThat Sunil dignified prominent conservatives you've got that right but please call me Dr Savage when you refer to me because if you called that fraud Dr Ford doctor every minute with such a\nSuch sacred tones doctor for a dentist Dr Ford that doc you think she was bigger than Dr Freud Dr Ford Dr Ford said this Dr Ford said that since a PHD that's real which I have from a great university greater than her as by the way and my publications great out\nJust great out distance anything that Dr fraud published pleaser front of me is Dr Savage from now and since you not recognize his PHD is a high value\nAnd it also adds a certain or of respectability timid she'll call me whatever you want to make sure you call me Dr Savage do whatever you do to be fair now since you believe so much in the doctor business\nBut the main thing is you don't even have to call me that just try to analyze what I'm saying for the sake of the nation do you actually think it's unreasonable to be skeptical about these things in your heart of hearts are you not skeptical yourself\n[noise] all you people are right for New York magazine the Daily Beast come on when you're alone by yourself in the toilet in the darkest moments of your I'm Alone is at night when you see you have no friends because of your main meanness and your horrible politics\nAfter all the paid volunteers have gone home when you're alone and you wonder where you went wrong in life you have no wives no husbands no children\nAnd you ask yourself all that sex and no children where did I go wrong\nThat's the one line I Love that's my favorite line by the way to the TV and so to try to attack\nAnd you ask yourself all that sex and no children where did I go wrong\nThat's the one line I Love that's my favorite line by the way to the deviant suit to try to attack the way they think they can get to look at them and I said all that section no children they don't have an answer for that one\nBecause that's the way of life that's the normal way of life and it has been from the beginning of time and it will be until the end of time which is children children it's all about the children and it it what I Love is all those are talking about the children most don't even have any they generally have no children\nThey all look like Donna Shalala I don't understand that the ones who are most interested in children have none [laughter] how does that work\nWhy are they qualified even talking about ... children if they never raised one what do they know about raising a child they stayed up night with a child with the flu and lost sleep have they ever gone to school with a child who couldn't do math or because they were so distracted and put aside their own self interests\nHave they ever gone to play is they didn't want to sit through for the children have they sat on soccer fields in the cold to cheer on their son no but there are all experts on raising children isn't that interesting and those of us are actually raise children are sneaker that as readers\nBy these wonderful people who have taken over our society you see what I'm saying [noise]\nAt least that's how I see it\nAnd I just don't buy this right now this little particular\nCharade I don't doubt that tomorrow the next day they'll dig summing up out of a trailer park and then there'll be a Jack Ruby right afterwards first they'll get to Lee Harvey Oswald\nIn the Ku Klux Klan outfit or the or at our a outfit or whatever and there's probably not an enter a outfit like I Would say camouflage jacket with a Trump a sticker on a Trump flag or something from pat\nThe ultimate a villain here would be somebody with a magnet hat\nAnd enter a sticker on a camouflage jacket with a Confederate flag or shown on it right holding a copy of stop mass hysteria saying he's a member of the ...\nThat was the perfect the perfect villain marched out and then they'll have a script in his hand and get something out of prison in Tallahassee or Georgia I don't know and are from like let's say you have free healthcare for his family for three generations of he'll take the fall\nAnd maybe a you know some money thrown in with a one way trip to the Virgin Islands on a Sicilian fishing boat\nAnd then they'll say it'll declaring yes I got all my ideas from talk radio I listen to talk radio and I know that all these people are even trying to destroy America the new world orders and that's why I did it that can happen\nAnd if it happens civil liberties that so\nWhat am I going to do I don't know what tomorrow will bring\nAll I can do is take it one day of the time and use the powers of raising the God gave me that has not yet taken away from me\nBack yesterday when I don't know that I could I Can't quote the person but yesterday I went to

there's a funny thing today they can only control so much for so long and and now that they've lost control of the narrative itself I think they're trying to take control of a new narrative\nIn my opinion that's what they're doing here\nThey've already distorted America's view of the population\nThere making you think that a good percentage of the population is gay or lesbian or transsexual in

I mean the you know I'm just not a fun loving guy\nOr our own ... scenes of jump all over Megan Kelly NBC News as a whole seemed to jump all over Megan Kelly almost like they viewed this as the [noise] the trap door in the floor to get rid of Megan Kelly you don't have time\nAnd it looks like this is it now maybe you're ... she didn't know Berkeley\nAuthor any racist term or a cast aside any any racist tendencies of individuals or or some of the the racist and uncomfortable history of blackface and and minstrel shows it was an overt but it was enough\nIt was enough and she should have known better Megan Kelly is a very smart woman\nShe is an attorney she's a solid reporters she's no dummy but she fell into the ... the sensitivity these days is is is very big very large\nHow sensitive endless a black face the minstrel show I mean it's the ...\nThree big very large how sensitive and was a black face the minstrel show I mean it's it's the portable it's it's awful\nIt is that were dating is is degrading it is it's it's horrible as far as entertainment or as history goes I'm uncomfortable and I I Can't stand seeing the old black face acts or minstrel show while you know old film\nMakes me very very uncomfortable\nOn 'cause I Know it does it just you know as we've been educated and we we understand the racism and and what has been offensive you know and I\nIn fact because anyone shoveling that down I'm I'm told what to believe I genuinely find that offensive and I don't think Megan Kelly is a racist I don't think she's a racist at\nI think she got involved in a conversation she opened up the door she step enough in it that it has taken on a ... a life of the mind of its own and I it's going to do or in over at the NBC now here are a couple of\nOther stories that I pulled and I'm not the all the you know what let me play the audio or just as a refresher on to Trump's of audio from a vegan Kelly's program from I think this was was this one Tuesday or Wednesday or Tuesday and they're talking about Halloween costumes\nAnd ah this was the portion where they were talking about a black face and this was the start of what got Megan Kelly into hot water\n[laughter] I mean you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on last week or a black person and puts on white following like that that that was okay as long as you address another character and so\nNow I don't think it was ever okay I I don't think we had quite the sensitivities that when she was a kid Megan Kelly I think is a little bit younger than me\nSo we were doing Halloween back in the Nineteen seventies by the early eighties you know I was I was Thirteen and Seventy nine I was fourteen and Nineteen eighty so I was pretty much done was Halloween but you know for me the Halloween the heyday of Halloween trick or treating in in a you know the\nMenu at New York and going around my neighborhood off at ... road and our go place\nYou know back then you know that was the heyday for me and I would have been Nineteen Seventy two Seventy three Seventy four Seventy five\nSeventy six [noise] and then we moved to Virginia Beach ah Chris was Seventy six and then I had a couple of years of trick or treating their\nI never wanted to put blackface on but you know the fact that she didn't recognize that yeah that's offensive it's not right and um you know that's what got her into trouble but if you heard it was an overt\nI don't think she just played anything screamed oh my God ... Megan Kelly is a racist I\nDidn't hear it feels like something is offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair game and I got into trouble she didn't recognize that she should understand on all levels that it should be or even considered offensive and so that was the first Clinton and then there were she was talking about Diana Ross\nAnd one of the real housewives dressed up as Diana Ross for Halloween and\nIt was a controversy on the real housewives of New York could land as she is Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people say that that was racist and\nShe wants to live than around her one day I I don't know how like that that raises on Holloway ... here in the\nI don't think he really wanted to look like the Anna Ross who should invest as Michael Jackson\nDied so yeah there you have it as that is what started this ball rolling and\nShe should have known better again it wasn't like she ordered the N. word or said something just unbelievably racially offensive it was the lack of understanding that thin opened up this this ah this this little a craft\nAnd it's just expanded and people have piled on NBC a\nFellow employees fellow colleagues have jumped ... jumped on and here we are\nAnd numerous reports are saying here's paid six and I I haven't had time to look at a suit can you say if there's any definitive uh reporting a and at this point from from multiple sources uh cause some sources are saying Megan Kelly expected to NBC morning show after this\nUh you know it's been ratings challenged as well a page six earlier today at\nNoon have six from the New York post headline screamed Megan Kelly out after in DC a blackface drum\nStay at noon have six from the New York post headline screamed Megan Kelly out after NBC a blackface drum so Megan Kelly is out\nAccording to you know noontime today from the New York post they didn't tell me is out in the sea following controversial comments she made about black face this week a source told paid six it switches forty eight hours to kill me to be cut from the network during a panel discussion and we just heard the audio\nTalking about going to get in trouble if you're white person puts on black face a but it wasn't that way when she was a kid a oh she's forty seven so she has five years younger than me\nAnd of course we played her apology her Megan ... on the program a yesterday and it looks like this is it\nThat she's done you know the big question is sixty nine million dollar contract I read you might tweet from yesterday 'cause I thought this was going to be the case\nAnd I said that is in the eye again paraphrasing might tweet from yesterday I said is NBC or going to use some type of a an ethics clause or content closer to contract I to blow up ... humongous sixty nine million dollar deal\nAnd well it looks like they might have found\nWhat they were looking for to get out of this really really\nExtensive deal which hasn't paid off\nSo I don't expect Megan Kelly is going to be back on NBC ran a rerun today reruns scheduled for tomorrow in looks like she's a done and I don't dislike Megan Kelly hall I don't\nI don't dislike you're really at all I find her to be a pretty smart individual it's why I'm surprised that I think she unwittingly and wasn't intentional but\nAgain with everyone tried to stab you in come at you especially with her can situation NBC high paid and people were offended and she had a target on her back", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "25"}
