is\nClearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways a [noise] a in a new direction yeah and on the other hand you had\nA guy who was very closely associated with and seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey all ... all of a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background\nA who had worked in kind of the media relations a space for a turkey ... and the intelligence services or Saudi Arabia of under the previous government or the one that I'm ... and his father of essentially replaced and what we know about that\nOr is it is evident late or this Muslim brother uh to mark ... was a working it\nAppears with ... against his own government and so it wasn't just that he was saying nasty things about it and that can be a capital offense by the way up there is la ... insulting the keepers of the holy places uh the the family of Saudi Arabia royal family but\nHe was also threatening it seems uh the the uh\nThe government of a now predominantly looked in the ass as they call them so it it was a it was a apparently whether it was designed to such or whether it just went bad we don't know at the moment but I think it was kind of like a you know one ... or ... took out the other and a dog and did it\nIn a ruthless Sasha\nMy because Frank I think the American people and I I think you know there's been a night or being sold a bill of goods we're being told welders innocent journalist who's just writing things that are critical of the government which journalists in this country do all the time whether it's Obama\nOr Trump they they write critical things about the government I say critical things about the government but this guy was a player in the Muslim Brotherhood he was a friend\nOf Osama bin Laden and you said that he shared that organizations goal of trying to supplant the current government which is you say the current government is Saudi Arabia is trying to take that country in a western direction\nAnd uh and and this guy was trying to stop that so you know while that\nWhile that may not justify his murder um I I could certainly see that if the American public's being told was just a journalist\nWho was murdered and that's wrong\nThey're not being told he was a political player who may have been trying to is it fair to say overthrow the current Saudi Government and take it back and an Islamist direction\n[noise] foil or certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow of the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt they they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm taking\nEgypt in a serious supremacist direction now the government of Saudi Arabia shore is premises too but it's it's a it's a group\nUnder the Brotherhood that would be very hostile to us as was the Morsi regime in a post Mubarak Egypt and I think\nWhat the president and our government is is trying to wrestle with his first of all we don't know as much as we'd like and second of all we don't want to bring or otherwise contribute to the removal of the relatively friendly not\nAltogether but relatively friendly government under bothered that saw him on was one that would be dead set\nAgainst us and our vital interests and a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the Iranians would like that um I\nA mud was one that would be dead set against us a vital interest in a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the audience would like that other enemies of this country would applaud but I think that's not in our interest and the president's walked in the fine line I think yeah and it's a\nTough one wants to talk about something else the statutory commission to assess the threat to the United states from electromagnetic pulse big name we've talked about EMP before on this program it could come from an an attack\nFrom any number of sources that could come from a natural solar flare but it would literally knocked out some or all of every single computer chip in America which runs everything\nRefrigeration water power sewer you know the whole thing and in many many people would die if that happened in even a an area of this country the Congress has finally hearing some specific things that can be done to safeguard against this threat\nWell they've been hearing it for years a large the first of these commissions are reported in two thousand four and a has done so several times since I'm a\nWhole bunch of reports were finished about a year ago or they haven't seen any public light some of them were classified but some of them were supposed to be unclassified and the government's sort of been sitting on them while the commission that was extraordinarily informed knowledgeable talented and uh I think authoritative\nOn these matters has been replaced by\nA politically appointed one that I fear is going to be none of those things and so we may not actually get the kind of\nA clarity about the danger that will say let alone the tide of corrective action that's needed um\nAt least in this uh this new commission that's coming on stream a presumably shortly is a is involved and\nAnd this is heartbreaking because I think the president wants to do something about this I Believe John Bolton has a bus or a national security advisor is very ... committed to trying to shake says there's an executive order that sort of a kicking around\nInside the the executive branch at the moment to protect our grid it's absolutely vital and you say a lot of that because my died by some estimates according to the previous commission it might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nDavid hit ... you know I mean if we had a ... kind of attack saying you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group hit the west coast within EMP and knocked out\nAll water all power all sewer all all all supply all ability\nTo move goods around or anything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication down all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small

I Try not to confine myself to just a narrow range yours is\nPerhaps the most optimistic but not optimistic you know based on just ... look at the world but optimism based on real numbers and I'm I I follow your Twitter feed and I think it's absolutely amazing what you've been able to do so\nGive my audience a taste of what happens when you actually look at the real numbers not just about the United states but about the rest of the world and how things are are getting and have been getting a lot better for a long time and they're on an upward trend\nOh thanks for the opportunity to do to your uh took to audience ah basically I'm a ... it's much easier to put together a list of things where the world is getting was then a list of things where the world is getting better\nBecause the world is improving along many different die mentions a most importantly obviously people live much longer than they used to um get a life expectancy for hundreds of thousands of years Bailey was about twenty five to seven years uh now\nIt's uh [noise] I'm Seventy nine years in a in a rich countries it's Seventy two years in developing world um we have more food than ever before\nAh for most of human history people worried about getting enough calories to see the next day I'm today people worry about obesity\n[noise] um at least or the uh it it's almost a universal um girls go to school was previously a they weren't\nAllowed to um there's even more peace around the world and very few people be she ate that are really for the first time in recorded history there are no international conflict by which I mean conflict between two sovereign nations so that there are a lot of ways in which I'm\nIn which the world is getting better unfortunately\nUh the media but also the human brain and we can talk about the structure of the human brain late to a focus is on the negative rather than the positive and so he set of long term trends people are looking at um\nYou know individual instances of where a something bad happens and they assume that that somehow the representatives of build the trends ...\nMurray on I I have to plead guilty but I've worked in the news business for a long time and I I hated it baby would say why is that you always tell bad news and I said well uh we ... I happen to live in a city with a few hundred thousand homes and\nI said we always do the story about the one home that caught fire last night instead of the two hundred and Ninety nine thousand homes that didn't catch fire and that can lead you to a little bit of a pessimistic attitude but I'll tell you the number that impressed me the most because we realize that well money isn't everything\nThe ability to be out of the extreme poverty which has been you know it's been the norm as you say for an awful lot of the world for a long time but you took numbers in the world bank and pointed out\nThe people who live in extreme poverty in Nineteen Ninety that was thirty six percent of the world more than a third of the world lived in extreme poverty and lived on less than two dollars US dollars per day\nAnd that suggested for local prices that number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped\nDollars US dollars per day\nAnd that suggested for local prices that number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world to about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said\nEven though world population increase by two billion people the number of those who were extremely poor you know this is just scratching a living out of the dirt was was\nReduced by one point two billion and I just wish more of those numbers were put in income to put it in context the other developments where we do have to say there is a famine here or a drought there\n[noise] yeah I'm as max Rosa from accept pointed out um we could have Iran or the number\n... ... the the the newspapers could run the following headline every day one hundred and Seventy seven thousand people have escaped from absolute poverty today and they could ever on aid for the last twenty five years and he would be true um but to your point about the news cycle that the problem is that\nGood things tend to happen on a different time scales from bad things bad things tend to have them immediately and that's\nThe way the news is what is good things are incremental they proved slowly over long periods of time\nAnd uh consequently\nUm they don't like the the headlines are the headlines usually are if it bleeds it leads nonetheless we live in a world with the least amount of absolute ... ever and for the first time of the Brookings Institution show last week or two weeks ago\nA loss that half of the world is middle class who would have thought\nHalf of the world out of what are we ready to seven billion or a billion already\nWell there are seven and a half billion people in the world and\nWhat Brookings is using the it is to divide the world into four groups are the first group is people who live in absolute policy that's below two dollars per person per day adjusted for um local prices are then the second group was between two dollars and eleven dollars\nThen the third group which is\nWhere the middle class begins with us from eleven to a hundred and ten dollars and finally the full scope laws over a hundred and ten dollars per person per day\nAnd a roughly three point six billion people a fall into the category between eleven dollars and I'm I'm a hundred and ... and a over a hundred and ten dollars so um yeah for the first time in in in world history half of the world is a middle class\nI'm Talking to Mario on to be who is the editor of human progress dot org I highly recommend the side and their Twitter feed and I've got no other dog in the fight I just look I I was talking to a reporter today and she said uh your wife tells me that you're an optimist I said I Am an optimist I think most problems can be solved and things are getting better\nI'm I'm a big fan of ... who wrote this you know this guy or gal environmentalist but\nYou don't just focus on the numbers and on on dollars and cents you also focus on just the general improvement of the human condition can you give my audience a an example or two of how things are getting better you mentioned education\nMhm [noise] well I'm a first of all let me just say quickly that I don't see that you and I are made to be optimistic this is not about convincing people to be optimists something on blind optimists it's about people\nBeing ... real is about having a realistic view of the world and the realistic view of the world is one way or things are improving now when it comes to education a that's a that's a perfect example\nYou know I'm a as late as\nUh the beginning of the of the of the twentieth century it was very rare for people to receive more than a two or three years of education even in the most ah developed countries I'm now\nA education the primary education certainly so at least um seven or eight years a primary education is completely stand that [noise] and\nUh one of the reasons for why that happened\nLast technological progress you said you liked technological progress than I Do like doing little bark and one of the greatest inventions also closed the tractor a and a a mechanization of agriculture because for the first time in history I'm a farm owners didn't have to rely on their children\nAre in order to the farm work um but we were able to keep the children at work while uh the the the head of the family of the farmer used a tractor and in order to produce a to\nTo have a ... tons of little dinky cars the size of mini Coopers to have\nOne or two pickup trucks the right\nAbsolutely yeah um it's crazy I mean just in the last\nWe'll dinky cars the size of mini Coopers to have one or two pick up trucks right\nAbsolutely yeah um it's crazy I mean just in the last Thirteen Years from twenty twelve to twenty twenty five they won the average fuel of cars that are sold to go from twenty nine miles per gallon to a fifty five is just that it's an almost of doubling and all the years we've had automobiles um\nTwelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically doubled fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier\nThey have to a vastly increased costs in order to implement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait wait and they're doing both and the problem is is that um there's very little benefit\nFor this this ad thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per\nPrice of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be a little bit\nLower right now that'd be nice but it's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil in a crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserves in ... so the rationales entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill\nPretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians have bureaucrats\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard\n... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now when if you frozen standards wouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people buy newer cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get as good gas mileage\nAs the one that's brand spanking new or a year or two old if we could stop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or\nHas come as close to a freezes possible on all the new standards were pushing the car companies to get there if we could reduce the cost of\nTo the American family uh buying an automobile more of them would buy brand new ones that means more game would have new were cars a year or two or three or five years old and we could reduce that Thirteen your average\nAge back to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we'd get more fuel efficiency and we wouldn't have to batter the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are you know um our economy it hits it hits all the way down in the ridiculous idea is that as you said earlier because you've got to\nGet that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the cars that are\nThe bigger cars that are more comfortable and have more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those to push people into lower cars so it really skills to market it screws profitability of it\nYou know it screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and the auto makers making vehicles that people actually want to drive and\nWe're living in a gray days right now or technology is doing amazing things with a you know crash warnings and laying changing and break assistant and all that good stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they're going to keep people out of these cars and\nThey're going to hold onto their car much longer um which is not only less fuel efficient but it's also less safe\nWhile and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car you say well that's more efficient you say it's also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew they couldn't go out and say we're going to make it illegal for you to buy a pickup truck or an SUV unless you can prove your family needs that they couldn't get away with that what would they could do is say that new pickup truck or if she is going to cost you

R. C. because they remind people of the way the media treats certain stories some stories I literally think as a reporter the media loves to camp out on\nAnd other stories they would like to turn a blind eye to if they can get away with it and Jeff you've got just such a story tonight about major political scandals that are being largely ignored by the made major media aren't there\nYes see our first date for having me on the bars are so we have a bunch of stories really scandals and controversies that uh have happened since the\n... all the way back to\nThe gay wary of twenty Eighteen to see all these scandals of all the Democrats I just was waiting for a Senate bill or and or the center of intimate a government end as ... what we found is dead and when it comes to this deal scandals the news media\nSpecifically the sleeve major networks ABC CBS and NBC or are either not covering now might not appoint on them or just\nBarely mentioned ambulances burying them\nSo they do a little bit of token coverage and that way they can say well I I didn't actually\nAre are not covered the story we covered it but to but it's like putting it in what they used called the airplane pages have been of the newspaper F. Fifteen a a a ten the right so it's kind of pages where they knew we could say we covered that story was on page eight ten right there\nIn front of God and everybody and and nobody actually saw it but the better or roared stories sounds like a very interesting one we've talked about it in passing on this program but he\nLied about a DUI arrest ah when when he was younger and and the fact is he tried to run away from the scene and you would think that kind of scandal with dogs somebody and until and unless he actually makes a clean brush Tibetan says yeah it happened I did the wrong thing he could he could result\nNo we're dog somebody and until and unless he actually makes a clean breast of it and says yeah it happened and I did the wrong thing he can he can resolve this one pretty ... pretty quickly couldn't me\nHis right he could he could just say you know a ... billion a mistake when he was younger\nUh instead he chose to lie about about the insanity and and he insisted that he\nDid not try to flee from the scene a when in fact the liberal Washington Post who is actually fairly debate or they actually is their fat check a said that they do or the game for ... you know he knows that said that you know that he clearly lied about ...\nOr the arrest or this is this this is why\nI didn't make any of the major three network evening all morning shows or even Sunday roundtable shows was even worse is that a a CBS this morning to host you know he got he interviewed better wrote on October fifth or and never brought up the fact that he had a DUI arrest\nOr you'd think that that is less than ... some hot material let's talk about Senator Claire McCaskill has been and what she did with this government program\nOkay so there's a I'll Try to simplify this actually there is a tax credit\nProgram that said tended to help a\nA bill the house as a housing for the poor uh and uh it went away to Joseph Saddam shepherd was clearly Senator McCaskill husband dead is he a bottom all these tax credits that again we're supposed to be to help build cheap housing for the poor and he flipped him\nDo other developers any in or near like you know billions of dollars a by doing that played the things that they\nTook advantage of of a program that was a tenant to help the poor\nYou know liberal Democrats let's go by helping to porches I slip them personally and ...\nAnd ... and in that case all he was was an intermediary you know he he didn't actually do anything he just buys the tax credits up and then flip to them to other developers he was a marketing guy and he pulled a profit off that\nExact\nNow it's crazy a finely teeth Allison I still don't understand why the major media is a dog in this one except for the fact that Keith ... Keith Ellison the person of color and he's a Muslim two strikes against it kind of like a Kermit guys now the abortion doctor if you've got a couple of those characteristics the media is happy\nTo stay miles away from your story\nPlay now and this is what's really upset about this this is we're supposed to be in the whole hashtags needs Hulu men right there since it's been just a little over a year since the Harvey Weinstein was deliberate and and but when it comes to a Democrat like\nA you know ... ... email us ... his ex girlfriend has all these just atrocious charges about physical abuse that he did to her a a you know he he denies story\nBut look at the allegation the activation I think it Bailey's deserves a especially in you know I you know and and look up the beach movement\nAnd I mean you're pushing that it deserves examinations so I've perceptions long pet party positive\nUh he's in his ex girlfriend so are there was some coverage of this on the network but it's just total\nThree minutes and forty seven seconds\nWell if you want to keep track of these stories that are being ignored by the major media check them out at media Research Center Jeff thanks a lot we appreciate your help\nThank you so much\nIt is a pleasure to have you on let's go to your calls now Kevin's on the line hey Kevin welcome to bars large ensure what's on your mind on this Tuesday night\nHey thanks flowers for taking my call um [noise] so I got three major differences or for\nIraq Obama's a a ... approach versus a down ... ... a couple of laughs and her block Obama\nIs ah should be a crime um so you know their approach was quantitative easing his entire term which is in the sense\nPrinting money and giving it to the largest banks which the banks turned around and bought a a U.S treasuries and got three percent interest off yep I'm you know a a Elizabeth Warren and a\nBernie Sanders a you know you know they've switched their tune now but if you uh do the research on that and even in her own book cheat Elizabeth Warren's thought that the whole time or going out to a ... a Timothy Geithner a A N van\nVernacular on that and uh [noise] do you uh um the other thing is is that uh uh they took a a twenty three billion dollars or more I I guess it could be eighty eight of you\nAnd the other thing is is that uh uh they took a a twenty three billion dollars or more I guess it could be eighty eight if you really follow the math on it diluted\nThe a U.S a shareholder or or worldwide shareholders in a General Motors and stepped in line and in a paid off the ... and um ah they were sued by a a teachers' unions police unions a civil action\nSuits are against that and uh um uh uh but nobody nobody uh squawks about death and um ah they they executed\nOr one of the worst crimes on the American taxpayer\nEver in and uh uh liberals will come around and they'll talk about or Reaganomics or or even a ...\nA but is there is under example of a Reaganomics given to the rich and it trickles down south or any bigger exam\nIs there any bigger example of of a given money a printing money now borrowing and not moving from one place to the other but printing money and given it to banks and hoping they landed which they did not\nI don't think there is a good example of that and that's the thing that's all ... ... what the call Keynesian economics economics but the idea being that if you prime the pump up the economy by injecting a bunch of free money that that will make the pump start turning and then when you do that\nFear of criminal violence in my country now they won't be able to do so again\nThis is the first time at that tweak is going to be tested\nWell and in fact look I feel for people who are stuck in one of these countries where the government doesn't seem to address the primes the problems of crimes and violence but that's an issue that needs to be resolved by each country or if your government is persecuting you because you're gay\nOr because you're a different religion or whatever I understand that but even then if the standard was uh\nThe economy stinks and there are a lot of ... there's a lot of criminal activity how many of the seven billion people on planet earth might be able to credibly say you know those things are lousy back home I'd like to go somewhere else I Would imagine it'd be a very large number\n[noise] yeah and and that's the key point that that that of course that's missing from the higher the empire ... or whatever we talk about the care of and the press never seem to\nHave to consider the fact has an ... or if the law you have about five million people I'm sure all of them I Love to come to the United states and we let them all in a way could I mean it would completely over on the United states simply allow that to happen because we have of course is laws in place that we have to look for ... um so so\nYou know and and you mentioned the federal billion people around the world about\nYou know thirty to fifty percent of them were also love to come to the United states that that that probably has always helped people back in their home countries try to help their economy improves try to help the government get control of a criminal activity that have to take place there\nAnd that's what President Trump seems to be praying right now I he he is apparently told the president of hot Dora hey workout all federal funding if you guys don't stop this caravan heading up to the United states or Santa has an effect\nChris ... is deputy director numbers usa which does great work on immigration issues because by that standard I Would imagine that if the current\nVictims of criminal gangs you know of all of them could get together in a caravan it'd probably be tens\nOr even hundreds of thousands of people and they left I'm sure the criminal gangs don't go out of business\nThey just turn to the next set of victims until what until you've emptied the country so so it's really not a ... it's not a solution and I think I'd even make the case Christian you tell me what you think of his argument that if you take some of the pressure off or country by having some of the people in the worst situation leave\nKnowing that there are still nine million people that those criminal gangs can pick on and steal from because that's what they do for a you know for a living to get them get their money that ... in some ways you may actually put disillusioned farther away\nBecause the folks who are most local most willing to pick up and pack up and leave and go somewhere else or they aren't going to get rid of the the folks who are actually doing the bad acts but they will they may take the pressure off the government to try to fix the reforms and and make the change is necessary to get rid of the problem altogether\n[noise] right right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using the fight off my hall and will probably\nAnd just necessary to get rid of the problem altogether\n[noise] right right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using file and we'll probably use the caravan of we've seen a pack here and there are some ... that will jump in\nAnd and and try to take advantage of of the fact that you know this caravan coming up they're going to get some are going to get ... and they're going to have the benefit of food and water that's going to help will make a make a track through through Mexico to the U.S Mexico\nBorder but but the the vast majority of them are that are good people there are people that are willing to work you\nKnow they're willing to al ... and ... it's ... ... that's happening down there and and a lot of it is is the responsibility of the government the government now and has done it stops a spike the\nAmount of us aid that's been down there he got these folks leaving the country of a benefit the country in the long on\nNo one Chris thanks so much for having me\nNow to Chris ... from numbers usa to your calls down Dan's on the line and California Dan what's on your mind or nine\nHours well I'd gotten a little disagreement with everybody hate and all those those warm

immigrants they haven't signed onto our laws are way of life\nAnd all the constitution are it's bad enough our own students don't but they certainly don't know what made America exceptional and what made it so special and that's part of the problem why people like me pose allowing unfair illegal immigration let's go to Christine in East Lansing Michigan\n\nYes I Want to say that one of those

them\nYeah I I see it all differently I see them is very insecure not superior that may be a cover and\nI think when you use your motions all the time right to see everything emotionally instead of some of our callers logically and with reason let's figure this out and we you may not have heard a we had a very nice lady who was talking about the fact that some sexual assaults happen to her and yet she had no corroborating witnesses\nAnd emotionally she feels and I understand it hey a a less perpetrator needs to be found guilty and face the consequences but logic and reason might ... leader

immigrants my parents to skate Nazi Europe in Nineteen forty one they were lucky to get into this country needs to sponsor they went through Ellis Island so I don't have a lot of sympathy\nFor those that you know break into this country illegally and you know they want more you know I could not economic hardship my parents were running for their lives there's a difference that's number one and they still came here legally number two\nThanks to the idiots to run their their lovely state of California where I live\nUh and you know we're trying to make it a sanctuary state she the laws changed you didn't know just due to the constitution all of sudden changed it's no longer a legal to break into the state of California she once you get here as long as you get in and then you don't break any other laws too good to go\nThat this has been this is the new law that you didn't know was like\nRewritten into the constitution and it is the most under rigging upsetting a circumstance and you'll also notice it's gone\nFrom illegal alien which was the actual correct term to illegal immigrants to undocumented now you noticed the left they don't even say illegal immigrant anymore everyone's everyone's an immigrant illegal legal doesn't matter everyone's an immigrant\nThis is what are left left is a has become\nA I didn't do that but the left certainly has a that was done very well with

foreigners become its own state uh but of course I'm never allow that to happen because Democrats would never went on another election a nationwide\nBut you're right you're right about illegal immigration you write about the fact that we used to be illegal alien but they win the battle of the language right pro choice for his pro life\nA livable wage I got to talk about that some more of that you know business owners you a livable wage no it doesn't always get low wage\nBut they when the language every oh yeah I forgot the big one a global warming became climate change when I was too cold at certain times that they're really good at winning the battle of the language and when you get to find terms you tend to when\nYou see making really good point you know they're always moving

something as I said at the start of the programs that day I Will never forget\nWhen I saw a couple of these homes but it's it's going to\nBe a it is going to be very very very interesting and as I said the congressmen will say something a today\nOr what does it mean well it means that even if the net loss suffered by a homeowner far exceeds their annual federal tax\nPayment they can carry forward that loss for up to Twenty years by amending\nTheir twenty Seventeen returns last November the IRS issued a what\nThey called a safe harbor for the treatment of crumbling foundation related repair cars as a casualty loss the duck shouldn't from a tax payers taxable\nIncome under section one sixty five of the Internal Revenue code they Republican tax\nOverhaul signed into law in December

congressman Larson will be with us this morning at ten minutes after eight two ladies plans right out so you'll know exactly what is going to happen I didn't you know something I I really my friends I didn't I didn't think this was going to happen\nI don't know why but I just everybody in the beginning they said he could do it we can't afford it we can't do this and then all of a sudden\nThe congressman got together and the president got involved too and uh\nSo it is going to happen is going to happen and I think that is fabulous these husbands and wives children that suffered\nAll this time because they didn't they were losing everything they were losing everything\nAnd now that's not gonna happen thank God\nTwenty eight minutes after the hour of five\nO'clock in the morning if you

mean it when I tell you have been just a tremendous folks what'd you call us talk with us all to myself a give us some ideas\nAnd you give us some great ideas and one of the things when I go out to speak that I tell my audience is is that there's so\nMuch from you that I get that is that right there right there and I use it a great deal\nYup use it a great deal when I go out to a out to speak so again I think the whole team the whole team\nTogether makes that makes it happened I got\nA couple of other stories that are\nGoing to be interesting this morning democratic challengers out raised Republican House incumbents in Ninety two house districts in the last\nThree months a staggering mismatch that boosts the odds of a GOP wash out in November\n\nThere is no historical precedent for financing this broad and deep for congressional challengers about half\nOf the Ninety two GOP incumbents are protecting battleground districts and some of them hosted personal record fundraising\nTotals in the third quarter of twenty Eighteen but they still bound themselves swamped by a combination of incandescent on line fund raising four Democrats and the bigger donors\nMy a combination of incandescent online fundraising for Democrats and the bigger donors reading money the challengers around the country as sixty one that Democrats raised over one million dollars\nFifty one House Republicans were out raised at least two to one according to politicos analysis of the latest federal\nElection commission filings wild Seventy one were outspent\nBy their challenger only five Democratic House incumbents were outraged meanwhile thirty three GOP representatives have less cash\nOn hand they and their democratic challengers while no democratic members lag\nTheir Republican opponents in cash cash on hand gap has been a particularly dire historical indicator in the last\nFour elections two thirds of the house incumbents who ended September with less cash\nTo spend than their opponents lost their seats\nWeeks later so that is the very latest right now\nYes typically only a handful of incumbents find themselves in that position each year but it's it's tough on the Republicans the Democratic fund raising surge is emblematic of the the intensity\nThat we have seen mounting for some time\nThis according\nTo a Ken Spain who was a former national Republican congressional committee staffer yup the only thing in our cc and the outside groups can do at this point\nWhat they can do is really nothing another Republican consultant just a wouldn't give his name but he said bluntly we're getting our\nButts kicked nothing else to say so that's\nHow it looks for the Republicans right now does not look good\nWith the latest information that I have just received does not look good Ninety two Democratic challengers out raised GOP house members in the third quarter\nSo we'll have to wait and see if of course they can change you know it's not a it's not over yet I just I think this is probably going to be one of the most interesting elections that are that we've had\nIn a long long time I really do I feel very very strongly about it and that the report that

in in the house of guys beating up each other and then one guy pounding each other with a with a with a fireplace iron almost killing somebody and you know especially around the time of slavery and Lincoln So I mean there are actual fires ... yeah\nI just finished a book on just what you said yeah it is a you know something there it is a miracle that there's a book called sixteen okay there were sixteen men yeah I didn't get much publicity ... oh really well didn't get much but they saved Abraham\nLincoln's life and ... he would have been killed\nBroke for any president really all they were after him way back then yeah yeah I Want to bring that young I mean you would love to\nRead I Love to take a look at that yeah yeah I mean people I mean it's it's that era of history Brad ... is is is amazing at a time when you know there's a civil war going on obviously yeah and when the president ventured out\nFrom the White House at the time you've seen this in the books and all the movies and all the depictions\nHe had very little security with him he had one or two armed soldiers and that's it and people could sometimes ... knock on the door the White House and walked right in and I want to talk to the president and it it's just amazing\nAnd then when he was shot in Ford's Theater yeah the guy that was supposed to be he well he was left his post it was in the bars\nIn the bar and you know a lot of people to this day say you know\nWas he also part of the whole you know the conspiracy with with booth and and and Mary ... and John ... and all those guy yeah\nYeah yeah people still researching it today I've been that you've been a Ford said oh yeah see I have a couple of times Yeah Yup it's fascinating for anybody to Cindy see I say go you know there's the museum downstairs and you can I tell people you can walk I mean it's chilly when you know when you walk around you take those steps up to where it happening\nOak ride in the presidential box and they still use you know people will realize for sitters still used for for plays in all like oh yeah yeah it's just that the presidential boxers not touched it's less away it was yeah yeah yeah I Love that stuff\nBut you do and I do oh my God yeah yeah those are the kinds of things that you liked to now you really like the game to the ... just can't imagine how we lived as long as he did yeah yeah yeah\nYeah and you know what's interesting about it in the world short on time there is now a theory\nThat I don't want to get too graphic here in the morning but there's a theory that you know when they brought him across the street and of course medicine was just so archaic back then compared to we have today but [noise] again and then not to get too graphic but one of the doctors on hand\nOr whether he used a finger or pro to try and get the slug guys out of a or the ball what it was a projectile out of the president's head there is now a theory going on that I read that had he just left it alone\nNation is promoting hardly a hopefully we hopefully even get you some tickets to give away on your show for that one of the\nFabulous [laughter] and when you get a way of on the rocks\nYou know the ah the ... the top ticket for someone Michelle Obama's ah appearances Liam with her book in the arenas which includes I think a meet and greet and something is is it us that the top the top tickets for her three thousand dollars ahead\nNo you know I've said this before I let me do you guys they see not the most popular Democrat in the country right now no question\nAbout all people are ... are in a roundabout yeah people are begging her to run a she\nOh I've said this before I let me do you guys think she not the most popular Democrat in the country right no\nQuestion about all people are Baylor and around about yeah people are begging her to run as you keep saying no no she's not going to run no she's not going to run but gee there's no question about it on a leash she is she's number one when it comes to a you know the people and admiration yep\nYep go I just wanted to tell everybody just that we're on the same page pollen route or on the phone with me there up there on her sister station WBRC in Hartford so I Want to give them the proper introduction we chat every Wednesday about all kinds of different things going on not only their but around the state around the country what are you guys talking about this week what's the big piece of news you guys the\nBall the governor's race the polls coming out and ride brat and it certainly looks like at least all the polls are saying what about four or five or ... percent leave for that Lamont\nAbout and and and Ned Lamont is getting the lead because of the female vote yeah that was the the big enemy he did very very well with the female vote gender gap Lee is twenty two points yup yup\nAnd I'm Glad you guys brought that up because I've been asking everybody all week long why do you think that is why is Bob such a I hate to use this word but turn off for the women why do they turn the women write off\nYou know only I don't think it's so much Bob I think you're seeing especially because we're in a blue state I think you're seeing an anti Trump vote I really do y'all from women I really do\nSo it's all the women just don't like Trump you know and\nThen I think so these are the same women though the will complain if Ned Lamont selected and they're suddenly going to have to pay rode the tolls and their taxes are going to go out\nYou can't win or if he doesn't close that gap is closing some ... some of them\nAre it's it's good to be ah it's gonna be an interesting one and and I thought and I don't think it anymore and I mentioned it very early this morning I don't think it any more\nI thought that this was going to be a time when the other side was going to get in just by a few votes but I'll tell you the way it's going now ah it it it might not happen it might not happen\nWhere do you think about the midterms in general do you think you're going to see a red wave a blue wave or sort of mix\nThan I think I I I just had a big story on this morning before uh before six o'clock\nThat uh they are the Democrats have really really lined up and have got things have got things pop and I\nI I don't know whether to believe it or not and but it's not it's not as wide open as I thought it was going to be that in my own opinion\nI I think I think the GOP holds the Senate and I think you're going to get a minor blue wave I mean all these sites now are saying that\nYou know leave the generic congressional ballot for the Democrats as a shrinking a little bit so you know we'll see I got to tell you something if they don't flip the house or if they only pick up a few seats I mean there's going to be calling that party that just you know blow up the leadership and start over here\nI can see that I don't think there's any question that they can't move now I mean when they\nKept well I'll tell you one thing or they're not going to be Trump\nI don't not with the people that are putting up there right\nNow no no they don't have a shot at all\nLegit you guys see the story yesterday the president's already had the president already has a hundred million dollars in his reelection can you imagine the crazy and then hopefully we're not even ask for yeah a lot of the small donations ... a small donations\nSo you know people are conflicted because that's sort of what we're at right now people are looking at the economy people are looking at some of the things that he's doing with\nOr whether it's our allies are folks that we don't like so much and he's saying he's doing it in a way I don't think people always appreciate but he's doing things I think a lot of folks like in other words asking\nAre friends of the European Union to pay up doing things that I think the average everyday common person wants he just isn't doing it in the in sort of a a tactful respectful classy way so people are conflicted they don't want to do and that's what and I think that has happened in particular maybe with the women too\nYeah I Know I ... I think you're spot on whereas whereas you know guys men will just say hey listen bottom line is he's getting the job done you know and maybe yeah I I'm sure you're rightly I'm sure to a big amount of the female vote it doesn't like Trump I'm sure it has\nTo do what style points absolutely ... did you see 'em on sixty minutes with you know who I\nDid I and I that was interesting\nI don't know what was the line I'm president and your and the president and you're not a very funny a grade stuff\nWell as I got I got to go got young kids so much I Love talking to you guys are great sounds great and I appreciate everything\nThat goes on here that would talk to your next week you got guys\nRight now I'm going to have a going let me tell you something he does yeah he does lay Elsie Ninety four point I\nOkay coming up\nMove forward I Need to jump jump yeah\nOkay I have a coming out to uh [noise] what type guys you'll get the time sometimes when you're going with you seven o'clock it's seven o'clock my French seven o'clock we shall return the good lord willing [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... am WBRC FM itchy three Hartford W ... and you have em W marry us talk of Connecticut [noise]\nHe doesn't think there's going to be a blue wave on election day how I'm Dave Anthony Fox News ...

I don't know what I Know and it's set as they say yeah\nYeah he's done so he doesn't know now granted they all have\nEconomic advisors you know the guy that advise and came on this it was a well known media guy you saw him on Fox and CNBC a lot Larry Kudlow who's a Connecticut resident lives in Fairfield county and he's a buddy of a ... yeah yeah he and he worked in the Reagan White house so they're so they're using some of the same\nTools over the years to jumpstart the economy with lower taxes and lower regulation yeah\nYeah yeah but uh it's it's great to hear all these different different things but fifty years that that is\nThat my ... now again Mr Trump has been a little angry the past couple of days because of what the Federal Reserve is doing with interest rate you know because you want you know what they do is to stave off inflation they raise interest rates on loans but then again when the your interest rates go up on loans and capital that's where businesses don't like\nThey don't like that because you know it gets more expensive to borrow money so\n... you know well it's going to be a yeah it's going to be interesting it's good of you know what's going to be interesting to see do you have any idea in your head in about ... who the Democrats\nWould put up for the presidency I've been wanting to ask you that well I'll tell you two people have already scheduled actually a free people are scheduling trips to Iowa New Hampshire already Cory Booker the senator from New Jersey oh yah gamble at camel Harris\nThe senator from California but that's the way out to the late at all a out to the left Michael Bloomberg the former mayor of New York city that wouldn't surprise me and he could he could\nHe could ah he's a multi multi multi billionaire his words is is I think two or three times\nThe worth of President Trump so\nMichael Bloomberg if he wanted to grab the former mayor of New York he could finance and entire campaign out of his own pocket\nNow here's the other thing he's Seventy eight [noise]\nLooks good yeah you know and I know people to go speak very good ... I Know people that worked for him and his New York operations is radio and TV operation\nYeah he said he looks good\nYeah you know and I know people to go speak very good I Know people that worked for him and his New York operations is radio and TV operations in New York but again you're talking about a guy who's going to be almost eighty years old and\nYou know um are people going to go for that Brad I don't know you know a lot of people with Michael Bloomberg\nTheir economies of people that don't like him for different things you know conservatives don't like his gun policy he's very he's very pro gun control\nThey liberals don't like him because he's very tied to Wall Street you know New York it easy to multi billionaire and a lot of libertarians you know independent thinking people don't like him because when he was a mayor of New York Brad\nHe was very big on trying to\nCut down on things like how big a how big the sodas could be a big new auction guy ever yeah but that one yeah\nHow ... you know ... you could not on a large size soda and you're right I mean there there are a lot of people who say okay I understand that Mr Mayor Mr President that's fine but I can make that decision for myself if I Want to drink forty ounces of sugar and soda a day and\nKill myself that's my that's my my decision yeah so but Bloomberg could pay for it he's worth\n... he's a multi ...

wins back those voters in the rust belt in Indiana and Missouri in Tennessee in Arkansas\nThe President Trump was able to steal away just enough from Democrats and I think who goes in with a message there and is able to win those votes back isn't anybody from New York or LA I I Know I\nI don't think so I don't think so maybe Brad though you know it could be\n... ... ... who really you wait a

America we could play Lee Greenwood early and that is right we could play yet at least we can get him in at least something and I don't believe I I'm I'm I'm even stuttering now well no I I Believe\nI Believe governor in Beloit going to what would the news broke last week he's going to teach your boss he went to Boston device you know he's going to teach them to BC long do you know I actually\nAttended a eight eight eight eight by other seminar where the governor ... years ago do you know and we we get on his back\nWhich was already polluted and distill it and make it into steam on the show and that's how they believe that it was concentrated that these guys actually received concentrated levels of dioxide\nOr did you where did you meet these guys where did you meet them\nWhen I when I met people I had to shake a lot of hands I worked really hard I unfortunately we don't have anyone running right now in the second district against Joe Courtney but I mean Joe Courtney nowhere to be found and hasn't done anything to help these men and\nI my heart goes out to them\nI they're all over um you know I'm also a real estate broker so I Would go into homes a veterans and I've seen a lot of of really sad circumstances that these veterans are just sort of discarded and it's not just the ...\nUh you know the a blue water navy but it's a lot of veterans down here in eastern Connecticut and um it's kind of sad\nYou know what I Would have you put anything together I mean it's great to talk about it on the radio but I mean if there is this is happening why can't we get together and get something going on this in here in the end that it is\nIt is going it's in in the Senate Khamenei of Veterans Affairs the bill passed the house\nShe passed the house here unanimously free ... and nothing right\nOn the Senate is is playing around with it I see your Laurie that you know they're playing ... a year when it saying that there's no what are they saying there's no scientific evidence or the evidence isn't enough to push this through a will to the veterans committee and that's why it's not going through\nWell I think it's it I think it would go through that they put it up for a vote ... they they're sitting on it and part of the reason I think it's because of funding\nFor okay\nYeah I I think so on I really do I do believe that it's all a matter of money and it's just these guys should not be compromised like that's how I Would hope\nThat they're the pictures you know we're looking at the edges right now the victims right now yeah\nYeah it's pretty sad and on so this gentleman at ball I'd like to refer him to you and he's\nYeah my show we got him right here and go we're going to get a hold of them yeah so have him contact us here in the office will definitely ... definitely yeah\nHe he I think I think that I'm now is the time I'm In Connecticut and this is something really to be happy about and another reason I wanted to bring their uh to your attention was that recently a state law opened up this is um [noise]\nUh this month I Believe that would provide benefits to eight hundred that this is the state law [noise] so they would be eligible for it it's not a big deal a tax um property tax abatements for like a thousand dollars\nA month later yeah yeah a little thing I can tell you is there right now we're looking at him and we're going to get him on the program myself\nGet him on to interview him to talk and you started a campaign on this this is ridiculous you know the Senate is going to move on leaves just dumb I see why they're sitting on this ...\n... yeah but I mean this this other law that just passed and the state not everyone knows about it because most people don't read the newspaper they listen to a great shows like yours in the morning or so on that's why I wanted to bring it up that the veterans who have other than honorable this\nShows like yours in the morning I fell on that's why I wanted to bring it out that that that trend here have other than honorable discharge who in the state of Connecticut other than honorable are now eligible for tactical Jewish waivers\nSo ... ... ... ... people are listening out there and you know that trend on this tape and had\nA lesson honorable discharge we're not talking about dishonorable are talking about people who just did not either I'm ... sure or drugs or some kind of issue ... aka an honorable discharge they're not dishonorable my ... are now going to be able to get benefits\nAnd the glory I'll tell you something to alert people talking with Laurie\nHopkins Kavanaugh political commentator and she is on Ninety four point nine one of our stations are on Sunday she's on from\nOne to three Laurie of all the shots

it made a pause day to this is a Scrabble and we'll get to it ... thanks Lori and put a miserable in touch with us okay thank you I take care Bye bye\nBye bye so we'll talk to a ball about fighting a a for a these are veterans who are exposed to Agent Orange and again on the local level if you are a veteran or no veteran who received a less than an honorable discharge like Lori said not a dishonorable discharge but less an honorable\nContact your local legislator here in Connecticut because you know have benefits you didn't have before\nOkay and we're going to follow through on the

sounds good but we know now that this is something that is going to happen and what we're going to do with Paul and I are going to do\nWe're going to get some of the folks who have been affected by this on our program to talk about and what it means to them we want we want to hear from them and that's what we're going to do\nBrad as always you're again you're right because persistence of this

sector and the insurance companies and with the appropriate backstop\nOn and a lot of work done at the federal state and local level and frankly there's a need for the private sector and the insurance

out people who ... no fault of their own you know a upon themselves as God awful situation\nRight well I tell you we can't thank you enough a congressman really and and ah yeah we're going to get everything\nThat you need from us we can guarantee that we can guarantee that\nWell I I think your breath and I think the uh the citizens of the state of Connecticut are you the people who have been impacted by this have been devastated so all of this how the public information and where to turn to because it is\nUm where I can be confusing and you know both the Connecticut the taxpayer advocate and the uh\nUh CPAs of Connecticut are also working very closely to because they want to solve this problem for people who find themselves or order or when you when another just the incredible devastating situation\nWell again thank you and I know we'll talk again soon before it through a Brad\n... up a good work things Congress hundred pretty she had to have a great day you bet\nNow outside you know yeah Brad you know people might not understand if they're not affected by it that's why why is this concrete cracking and I found a little passage here that seems to seems to explain to pretty well now the cars been talked about\nPi right or Piatt typed now [noise] if pie ride or pie a tide are present in the rocks underneath buildings the swelling caused by pi rider prior type\nCan push on the foundation walls and basement floor of the building causing cracks and others structural damage in some cases allowing groundwater to seep into the crack foundation now\nBrad if pie ride or pirate type are present in the aggregate material used to make the concrete for the foundation\nThe building material itself can be compromised if water and air and get into the concrete through small cracks in holes\nIron sulfide inside can begin to break down cracking\nThe comedy and that's what happened yeah yeah he kept talking about it ... out when we were out to sea yeah one of the places you can see you could see cracks\nIn the water you could see the cracks in the water the whole thing I saw them yeah so the bottom line is you can now consult with your account and you're going to get a is a congressman set up to eight twenty year tax break a write off if you have to do [noise]\nYou know these repairs and bread I mean some of these houses are pretty big I can only imagine what you'll have\nTo do to go hunt tractor in there I Would imagine that would have\nTo be done section by section of how it's going to be you probably have to dig out section by section of your foundation they were talking about that long before I even thought they had a plan and report the foundations means you're digging you've got to dig away a ground\nFrom the outside you ... you probably have to break through the foundation clean it up report that concrete piece by piece you can't live the house up off the almighty God what a nightmare\nNo one an absolute nightmare but I I tell you I tell you a ... I I didn't way back\nWhen this all started yeah and we started talking about it here in the morning and it all of a sudden started to grow and grow and grow but still people are I mean they ... they would come in here and they they just didn't believe it but it's going to happen\nNow yeah and and it's a good thing when it happened\nIt's good that they did this and again like the congressman said most of it's in the Vernon\nArea second congressional district so thank God you know I Know those people are suffering but at least it's not that widespread every problem in other parts of the state but again if you're having problems if you have a foundation problems like the congressman said go to his website there's a weapon are coming up or in a in this month\nAnd like you said the first thing you have to do it we all have accountants you know ... if you're facing this huge expense you have\nTo talk to your accountant about how the best way is to handle this over ten Fifteen or Twenty years especially now maybe you're a little older and you want to sell your home and you want to move to you know retirement community around ... ... and Brad\nHas to be written into the sales agreement on that all my God between ... and the ecology huge job yeah but I think that\nOh I'm Brad has to be written into the sales agreement on air boring oh my God between your ears in ecology huge job yeah\nBut I think that this is going to take on a whole yes a whole gang of it's all yeah I really do it it does it get started yeah it's good and he talked about that other problem I Know what do you remember that you had some homes down south that were made with this dry wall terrible from China that had\nToxic chemicals in it ... and and and people buy they didn't have that right on the radio yeah they didn't know their mind a condo who you know into a condo where the houses I owned a condos Emma\nNobody asked where did you get the dry wall from I mean you you you expect is the United states you expect everything to be up to code that's right you know that's why that's why I live in a tent [laughter]\nBut I'll tell you is yeah this is this I mean today you have no idea how I feel\nPolice department the these boxes are there um you can you know twenty four seven accessible you can safely securely and anonymously a drop off your medication and um they make sure it's disposed of correctly so that we're not having these environmental problem\nThat is now that yeah that means something so when in doubt call your local past department of say well you take my medication or if you want where can I\nCan I drop ... or even better you can just go on to our website you um it's C. T. dot Gov slash Dropbox so really really easy to find 'em now where do you find that so right on the Internet and see T. dot Gov slashed Dropbox and we have an a map\nRight there with all the drop boxes that are available in the state you find the one near your town um click on get the address and you're ready to go\nThrough they are says okay in boxes right there\nYou know ... just to find a you know one in your town or maybe near where you're doing some errands and and what's great is you don't even have to wait right on the ... right on the\n... so for example where we are in Bloomfield um Bloomfield belief seven eighty five Park Avenue and as you say commissioner yeah there there it is\nUm most of these are police departments resident now for some of the remote areas residents state trooper will take them but it's all rabbits all ... to lease yep yep so Fairfield guilt for and a hand in Hartford there you go right into\nTheir all over the place I'm odds are there's one if it's not right in your town\nIt it's in a neighboring town and\nEasy as can be there almost uh almost look like a mailbox\nVery simply and and you just uh how long how long have\nHas this been going on oh so this is this is fabulous um you know this was this was a great thing and it was started by a drunk control division where they just early on back in two thousand twelve father need and the challenges All right we want people to do it needs to be secure it needs to be handled environmentally appropriate [noise]\nUm so it it's really inexpensive and so two thousand twelve the first ones came out um over three thousand pounds of prescription drugs and that those of no but here's what's better three thousand pound it affects team we had over thirty three thousand pounds last\nYear over thirty seven thousand\nPound sixteen times you know say Eighteen touchy I imagine how many pills around thirty seven thousand pounds\nWhich are being dissociative correctly or out of people's medicine now that's a great program it's a great thing for people to take advantage of every year we see these numbers go up of people using these we're seeing more and more police station putting in these drop boxes and more ah consumers out they're disposing of their drugs so it's been great program\nBut can you imagine imagine hall if we didn't have all of them while they like it would happen well Brad I have police officers in my family I've got a number of police officers in my family\nAnd a one or two of them are in what you would term ...\nUpper middle class to upper middle class communities and they've talked to I see them at the holidays now when they talk about this very thing\nCommissioners you said the sets of of opioids for homes and from doctors' offices and from people who you know leave them in their car and stuff like that it's it's you know we're talking we're talking basically white middle class\nUpper income areas that are just habit having as you say a major problem with these opioids people leave around in the house and they don't dispose of them because a lot of times you know years ago like one of my police officer relatives said you know the only place they would go would be the bedroom to look\nAnd they don't dispose of them because a lot of times you know years ago like one of my police officer relatives said you know the only place they would go would be the bedroom to look for Joe jewelry you know when money now it's the bedroom and the bathroom now it's the bedroom and the bathroom for medication yeah that's yeah\nYeah it's yeah it's and that's going on today yeah and and one thing which is I I thought it was really timely now you know we're coming up on the holidays so this is really a time you're gonna have more people perhaps in your home you're hosting were or the reverse maybe you're going somewhere in your house is going to be empty for a number\nOf you're going to broadcast it on Facebook hey I I'm not going to be home soon weeks off your water rummage through my uh my ... my medicine cabinet add my jewels go right ahead I off screen TV right for another episode of information\nYou know that on social media but but for sure this is you know you're coming up with Thanksgiving and then the you know Christmas Hanukkah those holidays this is a time when when people either have a lot more people in their house or or or banning their house so really a good time to be thinking about doing this you gotta you know a month before the holiday and the out the medicine\nAnd you know one of the things to say there's no question when families are around when people are around guests are out they don't pay that much attention to watch the cat is the son who's walking around the house right now yeah around the ... yeah yeah absolutely\nYeah and you expect them to be in your bathroom because they're you know you're trying to you that you know during the dinner yeah ... ... so I'm certainly uh this is a good time it's really easy to do um they're safe secure environmentally appropriate ways to do it and you who knows what family member or friend you may be saving by doing\nThat then again it commissioner you mentioned and not only the the the the the aimed at preventing criminal activity but you know you and I were talking before we went on the environmental impact there are a lot of environmentalists who say now you're actually seeing physical reactions\nIn men and women and stuff that's been charted for years by things like you know sperm counts hormone levels are certain things in the ... in the blood endocrinologist kind of things and they think that one of the reason they're seeing these rapid changes even though\nOur ... even though our standard of living is relatively clean might be people putting too many medications\nDown the toilet or in the you know through the drain and they're leading into the drinking water\nThere's certainly a lot of environmental concerns and and that certainly wouldn't surprise me if that's I mean you imagine what thirty seven thousand pounds of these medications antidepressants where or dumped it yeah and the egg I depressions right absolutely and and and right out there\nAnd opioids can you imagine I mean I took I took commission I took a half\nA couple of years ago I you know my Dennis was because he gave me like three actually coat him he said I'm giving you three you probably won't need more than one I took one and you see I'm I'm not a thin I took one\nI woke up ... hours later and I and and that was that was from one and the only gave me free and you have people just trafficking in these things and not turning him in when they should to police departments\nMy book I I didn't know what day it was when I when I woke up of course that's normal for me [laughter] that I also I rather doubt verify that\nAll the you know [laughter] but anyway this is stuff that we've got to get out and keep on ... yeah it really I've just got stuff going through my head now about how we can not just have you here and then drop it\nBut there's something that we could probably do is remind people ah to to be looking at this all the time\nYeah that would be that would be great it certainly you know there's a there's a whole lot of things to be done to help combat the opioid epidemic and and those types of problems and certainly wanted is clearing out the medicine cabinet there's you know other programs we have an easy pay other of our sister agencies and partners are working on\nYou know another thing out there is there is no locks on which is a a\nReversal drug that can reverse an overdose now you never want to have to use that it it really you're you're saving somebody at the very last moment in time but um it it certainly better than not being able to save them at all and we we also have a program and um to to allow pharmacists to now prescribe knocks him so people can do that\nGreat Michelle's ego commissioner department of consumer protection\nDrug disposal and a thank you so this is very very Andrew are going to do this again this is very you know ... or so in Port so thanks again for coming

eight five five forty lawyer art Arthur will join us a lot more coming up\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe's a former immigration law judge at the what was formerly called the ins\nAnd now it's called ice and he joins us now art of I'm sure you're not surprised that after we did away with the family separation policy which was unpleasant and the media obviously played a big role in\nGetting people are very outraged about that a that this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border and the month of August from the month before so this is no surprise I assume deal\nNo absolutely not a lord ... took this long for your bed like this to assemble the fact that you know we see these courts no cubs to lead a hitter bring the president's effort to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals that your purpose and come to the United states is live and work in the United states and you get relief you've got to let you wanted and it's a it's at the center for those individuals her to be the states we need to cut\nOff his leg the credits was tempted to do it but Congress has stepped up and you know ... ... is all of them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things fairly quickly if it wanted to to stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be\nEnforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated the circuit cases none of those folks could be returned\nFamilies so that their cases could be hurt\nQuickly so that the good cases can be separated habits or the bad cases will be denied those folks could be returned to the United states they could also ah you know\nChange the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico that you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states\nAnd again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims if they do they should be applying for a asylum lot them all up they should be applying for asylum let's hope but they're not in addition uh\nThe uh the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where unaccompanied alien a minors has to be released after twenty days um Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if ...\nHow many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's a it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republican back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages he want to put babies how many times and we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... you know if we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous weights robberies murders\nUnder the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about as we saw a National Geographic of all things\nI wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all your little girl in a pink shirt standing next\nTo her mother crying as border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parents can subject their child to this horrendous during the United states is beyond me\nWell when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan ... who is paying for this I think there is no way\nWhen you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand\nDollars up to ten thousand dollars a cost to get to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expected administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably working their favorite this is another incentive again went back to verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smuggler definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory either verify that the keys the kingdom but until we get to that point we need the tension that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so those are the cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under final orders for mobile they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had\nBut they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading an ice chips lack of resources to go out and find once he's in Tuesday's people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under five orders to remove all you know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a puddle order removal and yet\n... they get released a in back into society\nOr apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a ... removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nEverybody needs to work together in order to make the system work with anyone part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said was luck I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and never mentioned anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the called coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get do you ended a paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview you sell the script for everybody man woman and child seems to me at the same and I fear for I think from my family that going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions\nWants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a land security bill I think it was attached to that bill yeah it but you know here's the other problem or and this is the next year that's going to drop about Seventy five Ninety percent of all people who claim credible fear bound to have credible here even though the asylum numbers are as\nWell as you mentioned before the problem is that if people allege that they have suffered were fears something then uh they get referred over for torture bench claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over\nA claims that of the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that are already back to ... the Justice Department needs that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also a as is here's someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there's no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing but think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's is it well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse\nIt hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate a local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation and plays but actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not that claim took place in the home country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum procedure ... very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries there if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nCare all the ways that you do connection to great carrying your community that visiting Chinese the health of N.

only way you could kill a blue collar person\nA little lower middle class person is through opioids or drugs or something because they're all too stupid to know how to get a prescription or they're you know they're just bunch of ... just how they treat the blue collar people this is why Trump got elected I Can't stand this kind of thing and it but it's just to put this is why I don't watch any TV I literally\nWatch the news and sports I watch nothing\nAnd there were tons not passive aggressive shots at her you know a John Goodman character who is Roseanne husbands saying you know she'd never would have taken advice from a she never did anything you told her to do you know that ... those kinds of like cites whites from the writing room there were tons of those throughout this episode\nAnd I I just I just think when you have a ... character that's been removed for a reason other than something to do with the show\nI it it's not helpful to kind of poke your finger in the eye of that audience and expect them to tune in next week it's not going to happen\nNow you're listening to Laurie Ingram show ran a royal is with us or let's go to Sharon in Florida line one Sharon\nOr I I think that there's three things um that are hidden behind all of this killing rather than one and then he brought to the show okay and she left the door open for forgiveness Valerie\nJarrett never ever accept that if I get married or anything else so they needed to crush her ... in in in order to make 'em Valerie Jarrett higher when it comes to I'm looking at her\nSecond I have watched each and every episode okay in the reruns on my ... cents look started and one thing works and well there was a week one it was completely the opposite\nOkay so why were we could do it and take on that power from her than putting this stigma of drug addiction on or not that I'm\nNow kicking in kicking the fate any yeah kicking the fate Sharon I'm Sorry we're out of time a well Raymond I think that is the way a lot of people think Hollywood thinks of them though a lot of middle America feel condescending look down to\nYou know they had to beat her down not only make or a drug addict but part of a drug ring in the neighborhood pathetic and out of character\nAh you're listening to your healthy radio addiction pat ... going to join us the blue wave or more of a trickle don't go away\n\n\n[noise]\nIt it has been closing up um I have been saying for some time in ... numbers the dominant off on a dead that from that [noise] but you know the the this election\nUm is still very winnable for the Republicans assuming that they do what they need to do which is and they've been very slow either but the cabinet and hearing so I think I'm galvanize to even before that\nYou could see that there were voters who are quite concerned with the issue of what I call chaos when you when you talk to voters about the potential need she are talking about is one of the big three I Believe um that worries the immigration you have\nYou know a large majority so huge majorities of people who oppose sanctuary cities who um [noise] uh are in favor of 'em I mean who oppose\nUm uh uh uh what's happening\nAt the border who who are more in a you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities are against abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight in democratic\nParty um doctrine I'm\nAnd I'm In the end who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty margin and people who believe that you know Democrats are are more likely basically to favor of the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump has put on this is a big issue and it's across the board\nUm and and um it change moves votes\nAs does the another issue which is important because I Believe um in light of the cabinet or stop the numbers probably are even more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house are already many of them pledge and we now have their chairman the hum of there to be chairman and if they win this year in committee I'm\nSharing that are saying what we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've always investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy and I'm a sense that um this is going to be chaotic chaotic and that it is\nGoing to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presidents whatever they say we're not as if that's their agenda\nSome ... that is to just to recap so you know the issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move is the number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the dams and say now refer to them the Democratic impeachment\nMob I'm a party um uh [noise] and\nYou know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of ... or reject every piece of the president's economic policies um which are booming for most people are at least\nMuch more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are off into or out of the middle one democratic socialism cupboard all with the idea of chaos you know whether to bang on windows they are going to disrupt\nA country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people say\nAnd some of the law and order on Netflix and hold on let me just again\nLaw and order a safety on order comedy the respect um respect\nYes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to like [noise] um but um except for the fact that both the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA socially the Democratic socialism of that bothers people and then the pillow city does\nOkay this is not is can't hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the whole you know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and he practiced statistical\nWhole you know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and he practiced statistical journalism\nUm and he you know he didn't get the production right in twenty sixteen I but this time and he's saying people should not be that surprised\nBy a Democratic Senate or a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a predictive assumption standpoint he sent a foreign five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it it just because someone thinks\nSomething as a high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable sack so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house ... no it isn't enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there looks very hard to predict the business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have ah the selection that there are many many things that are under lawyers to watch them most of all by the way is one like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning the country to the hands of the political class a elites and the\nSense of of losing what progress that the the bay and the the that anti Washington anti elitism still exist very great with\nThe issue has been from the Republicans can nationalize the election\nI still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right stop\nIt and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of the shows rather than crammed into local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but the international because then Harris lay off year elections are are off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the aisle parties is it the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either\nBut when you put the big issues in front of people have consequences then something happens and I think the Republican giving him all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch\nAnd all those they have not gotten together to do what they could do 'em to a national ... Berger national\nAround ... and now we have not and not just the local X amount is\nIs it a national election and people need to understand the choices because there are concerns are very great and Dan Kammen out here and he was the beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments\nRetribution that had some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection\nOf the Hillary Clinton proposition of even split among Democrats or whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil 'til you when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by Lawrence of morality that if the Democrats win\nCivility will get worse\nThings will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you or this is below sea on discussing Trump's desire for a long especially given what we're seeing these new migrants let's listen\nTime\n[noise]\nUh manhood issue and and that ties into what an ... the last question they she lives in the year the woman you have a lot of these ... interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans\nAnd some of them doing really well sell the year the woman you're the one that could also be the year the man of because well are staying with a man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin on it at all\nSo I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap or the goes both ways and the man uh and and again I'd come back to it's not just rubbing up the Republican base there were huge numbers of independents remember the Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy\nWith the way things these these the prospects are going and it is an heritage really than those voters as well\n... with weight thing these the the prospects are going and it is an heritage really that those voters as well as the base be exposed to a larger consequences of what happens if you will while the Democrats go over and what will happen to\nAll you have to do his point send us a signal to be\nIn Queens shiny trucks and snappy happy uniform\nAnything you wish was gone\nReally good at all you have to do is going to call one eight hundred\nJunk or visit one eight hundred got junk dot com\n[noise] hello everybody I bred Davis and yes I Am with Paul the Shelley does when my parole officer told me I Am with you I Can't believe I was you every morning and I as a dozen third day the third or fourth day I started to shake a little\nBit and I never did before I don't know what causes that but watch out for all I could say list yes Brad Will be back together on Thursday morning six to nine you'll be year from fight am on the talk of Connecticut [noise]\nWBRC am WBRC F.

I'm In the medical profession and I see so many illegal in my profession\nAnd they seem to always be getting certain tests that the American people who work and their their insurance doesn't cover thing but somehow they are able to to get the\nTar and there is such a burden to the finance finances in America and also using our resources resources that are paid for by the American people born American people but somehow\nThe illegal thing to to be able to get around all that and\nHow do you know there are legal you hold on you say a lot of illegals how do you know there are legal immigrants\nWell when you look at the paperwork when they come in um they they're they're they can't speak a word of English and they are ... or their kids to bring them in and they can't be the ... and use the kids that are that are in the system they usually come in and the purpose for the\nUh uh ... work uh-huh\nSay no no no I'm what I'm saying is that the paperwork you can tell gotta they have no\nNo um but there's a lot of other ways to do a lot of diseases that are coming in just like they just recently the guest that that is about forty I'm forty people that have come in with polio like viruses\nAnd the end you know this because many many millions of people are coming across the border that\n... from third world countries that have knowing innovation\nThat the health aspect of this is under reported an undercover it I agree with you\nAnd a ... when we come back we're going to talk to Bob ... who wants to be the surprise of Victor in New Jersey race that's very close\nBob

percent of students were approaching grade level in the writing exam just eleven percent showed a mastery\nOf writing at grade level public schools throughout the Dallas area I think we got a lot of issues that we got to deal with already we don't need to bring more issues in\n\nAnd the FBI agent puts their career on the line I Believe the FBI and the detail that we just think that people in Jersey on November six ... of all the information of who this man there's what he's done or what how he's failed the people ...\nWell the the races pretty tight and what's the latest on the polls mental recently it was a couple of points uh Menendez was leading a but is there any new reliable polling\nWell there's there's some polls coming out today and tomorrow but I have to tell you you obviously everybody always says the only one of the matter is one of the six but our internal polls are we've been consistent and we got you know world class pollsters just races so tight it's like a statistical tie\nIt really going to come down to who gets to vote out so we're just making sure that people know who I Am what I stand for my whole life has been action or you had to getting things done working with people who make things happen I been independent all my life it's time for people who put put people in Washington or go to work to get things done for the people\nWhat do you think are the issues that New Jersey voters are most concerned about right now I mean is it ... the economy's doing really really well so beyond that uh where does immigration for instance land doesn't ...\nI'll tell you I'll tell you Laura New Jersey people are smart and and they you know they recognize how poorly served but the bigger issue really are are twofold one is affordability of the economy is being dragged along by a very strong national economy people were underperforming\nAnd the people in Jersey or most highly tax people in the country or property taxes are outrageous ... income taxes sales taxes corporate business tax\nEvery tax the top of the heap and\nIf we were losing families the senior citizens are leaving we have the fastest way about migration of Eighteen the thirty four year olds 'cause it's so wonderful article for young people to live here\nSo affordability is by far and away the number one issue secondly is the fact that you know Washington has failed them were fifty fifty with the ... we get we get these spectra Washington than any state in the country and people say it's time for change your dirty deserve to be treated better\nWell the the state level of taxation isn't determined by a U.S senator correct\nYes but I have to tell you Laura leaders leaders leaders go with the problems are in one Washington has failed New Jersey when we're fifty at a fifty so poorly served every anything we get back is better for Washington is going to help the affordability of New Jersey\nAnd give it but also you know there's only three three jobs in New Jersey that every citizen gets a vote on the two senators or the governor I'm going to shine the light of day on every issue that matters to people in Jersey with us missile issue counties state or federal issue\nA leader's go to solve people's problems not just say somebody else's problem somebody else go here we've got too much leadership failure to Jersey it's time for leaders to leave either\nHey Bob listen uh Menendez hitting the trail with Hillary recently wasn't that happening\n[laughter] yeah I I was surprised she came I don't know how much they raise his what really was pretty ah neither that's why a super his crowd is how to put I think I think it was like seven and a half million of outside Washington buddy against me already this race\nThat's a pretty uh neither that's

wife and I we we waited in house or we saw the one I'm with the money we paid off a lot of our debt credit card car um a few other debts and I'm the only way that we have left\nIs student loan debt mhm um and so we ... we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loan debt [laughter] um so we're just trying to figure out what we can do between the weight of the new house\nAnd the ah the student loans that we'd have power we\nUm get that paid off but we're just trying to figure out how to do the\nUh spend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about I don't understand\nWho basically we're just we're just trying to figure out like a little bit there's three of them between us I'm a teacher I Know the build our loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nWho I Am from it was broke rooms don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in depth in years what's your household income\nSo calm between my wife and I we um we make ... about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and uh how much is your house primary\nBut we haven't gotten our first one we just moved um so it's kind of man will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay are you arrive at a fourth ... right and you have no other that except the student loans\nCorrect conquer and show if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income okay you got a lot of student loans for\nI think you've got to look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers were we were going to meet you where did you get your degree\n[noise] um so she has her masters I got my bachelor's was we we both went to in a you know with an Arizona University\nBoom boom boom boom boom and then [noise]\n\nThat leave us with those in Atlanta Georgia are welcome to the Ramsey show live I\nOn that are not as our mouth was up long long\nRight now I have a job and I'm making and making about forty thousand a year ... and [noise] um well I got another job offer for thirty three uh-huh\nAnd uh the only reason I'm considering it is because the the benefits are a lot better mhm I'm there for four one K. or paid holidays more vacation um they also pay one hundred percent of my health insurance\nAs well as your health insurance costs now I don't have any I Can't afford any mhm okay so the company that I'm In complete I'm with now it's been like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me ... and\nSo I thought it was awesome five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars\nA year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars ... you're going to trade six for non if you're doing it for health insurance four one K. benefit is worth very little and the other benefits\nAnd you know more time off is not what you need you need more money mhm\nThat and the potential to grow at the company would be a lot more quickly I'm I'm with the next year or two\nWould you double your income I don't quite know but now a quick which would be like\nI couldn't I couldn't be looking at the next two years I can be looking at like maybe [noise] maybe another ten thousand a year\nBack up to where you were\nUm yes plus the health insurance you know\nWhat the the the benefits are worth very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits okay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love\nShark and take six steps forward 'cause I Want to or how old are you a twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today mhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today if it's not until you are you in that direction\nAnd then you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that is a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job or in mind I don't I don't know exactly how are you not only that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the it ... it ... it could turn it could help transition me into the career I Want to\nBe what do you want to be which is I Want to be a master diesel tech okay what do you do now I'm a welder okay and what do you need to do to become a master diesel tech I Need to get my sort of a need to get all my diesel certifications okay what's the shortest quickest way to do that\nAt least will tell you that I Know a good mix along going forward to ... do a good diesel tech makes a lot more than forty two right\nDo yeah there are going to be looking at like a hundred grand a year\nThat's what I was thinking okay so what's the shortest path there again we've got to give them search how do you get the search um\nCommute or a technical school I guess the only way I Know\nWhat's it like once you get into a company that would put me through the school\nDay you got what's the other hand like you're talking about working\n... what's your the place you're talking about work and what do they do\nUm they actually work on a big or um or Eighteen wheelers in trailers and stuff like that\nWhat kind of work that they do so\nYeah they have them they have 'em there and stuff I Would just buy would be coming in in a different position in the coming in as a welder\nAnd you don't take your ... welder and they'll pay for you to get your search and in three years you're doing sort of a ... sort of hard work and you go from thirty three to one hundred then nobody gives a crap about health insurance we just tripled your income dude and you're doing what you want to do\nYeah now that's the plan\nThey have now we're three hours in the interview if you like it you say gently and kindly with a smile if you want me health insurance is not the case\nBut anyway I mean now or if they're you know or is in the interview if you say it you say gently and kindly with a smile if you want me health insurance is not the carrot to dangle\nQuickly getting made the search says the carrot to dangle and this rabbit will be going okay but I Need a plan I Need to know you start in the search what you do you work in a year before will pay for your search okay I'm In I'll take\nI'll take a pay cut for a year to get where I Want to go by the time I'm forty three okay but I'm not just taking a pay cut 'cause you gave me a little bit of lame oh health insurance okay wrong wrong motivator you fall on me\nI get ... you might make one ever since and soil\nSo Jack Jack in a nice way lovingly negotiate with them jak 'em up\nAnd go do you got you a new welder if you pay for my search when can I start when we were in charge you for a year okay you got your new welder where you put it in writing your favorite must hurt starting in a year\nAnd then figure out how long it's gonna take you to get through those search and then you know when you're going from thirty three to eighty to a hundred and then now we got a plan they'll get 'em and go get them open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five\nYou know let me tell you how to answer his question and it will help you

people who have wealth they started from nothing\nWhen interviewed and they asked them their decision making paradigm\nThey said I make decisions like career decisions or purchase decisions or investment decisions\nNot based on what will make me feel good friday but what will make me when ten and Twenty years from today if your decision making paradigm by which you analyze and critics apply critical thought to your decisions\n... makes you ask yourself how does this decision affect me ten twenty Thirty years or for that matter and they turn it ...\nIt will cause you because you're aiming

the line in Denver Hi Caitlin how are you [noise]\nPainting thank you for taking my call and thank Keli for taking sure when I quit like [laughter] like hurting at that my husband started his own painting drywall\nDigits a few months ago and he's got anything pretty a big contract but in a vulnerability toward a and like an income to go up there and by [noise]\nAnd so we're trying to hire anybody but we're not having a hard time finding good and reliable employees an industry that doesn't usually you read the need to hire\nThem how can the gadgets hoping to bring certainly the one way that we can possibly find reliable and good people to be a part of the small family that's it\nAnd\nYou don't know any painters that are good and the ... people\nWe do know painter um that are good I think people ... ... the guy that's the part of that there hasn't been reliable you don't know any painters that are good and reliable people oh well we do know that they have their own businesses as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own business\nFor the most part yeah [noise] okay and we're we're trying like we we put 'em up on Craig's list and like nobody's responding to it and so I just we just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the time either would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah and then most of the term do pushes run around with ... so usually when I'm looking good reliable people I look around other good reliable people\nThat could be that you look in some of the other trades and you know one or two Russian that's a good person or a trim carpenter that you're good version and your story asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter but you could bring them to the job\nPart of the problem they ... very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work either\nWell they got as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work even do fusses yeah\nAnd your has your husband's got more working hand on and so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage ah when you've got a construction boom always in the city\nAnd that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know I think is ample in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology someone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of\nTechnology and Web developer is out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done websites you've done on Craig's list but we get in technology groups

tech industry there's a great person will no somebody's developer and\nSend them our way and of course you're going to pay them and pay them well and I'm a ... paying a duplex doesn't make them anything except the well paid ... so\nYou you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of extra on people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people\nAh sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here that

hundred a year and what about the other one the other one will be around thirty four hundred a year\nAnd a thirty four hundred Twenty one hundred she'll Thirteen hundred dollars for a yeah and cry and how much is the doctor will only an\nOkay they won the ... it'll be four hundred are individual or the ...\nAnd for the high deductible Thirteen fifty per individual but there's a twenty seven hundred

the key to getting out of that\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps at up to a giant stuff at the end though\nAnd I I Would add to that uh the giving them the ties in um was really cold I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what we're give what we're tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away as we've learned how to live\nHave joy within our means\nAnd once you hit that point it's um\nIt just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nNow so

of this year we're done by so I'm In for a year\nYeah you could you can embrace of Europe pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen\nIt was real it was before that that you believe that yeah I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about\nThree four years I'm lying for me it was like when we are old as much as what the equity was um then it's like started feeling you know they

this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment though I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr are putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I started school\nSo that then you need to wait until you can pay for school\nI Would have never in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay\nYou got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with ... yeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just kind of see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... owns it take to go through the class again or go\nTo David it it it's a three year program so thirty grand a year or thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what a she makes a hundred and fifty thousand you can't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA wrong not when I'm not in coal\nNow if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand\n[noise] ah sorry I I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYeah it is that is uh if it is an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program\nThat but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for it if I usually go\nYou don't actually have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether\nThey finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mess\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or

used to say that that is not the problem is is a symptom of something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up\nYou get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets re bowed and you end up with a mess\nIf they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have zeroed in all of a sudden except

G. from tough\nAnd she just said that it has a market for above either for a heartstrings force\nLet me ask you something you can self publish books today you know you can bypass you're going to get publishers who may not touch it because there's not commercial enough that doesn't mean the book is not valid you could go out today into an Amazon related book or any of the other services and now the Britain publishing promote your book for you\nAnd you don't have to sell that many copies to get some attention and then then part of it is a good part if the book takes off on its own you've and then go to a publisher and say look I sold twenty five thousand copies on my own there'll be interested at that time Steve that's how the industry works today I give us a call now that's the tip for everyone out there who thinks that they're an author\nYou don't need to go to New York could have your heart broken they have a whole different you know parameter for books let's be clear\nAnd they'll say to you in the if you even get an answer sorry not for us or\nIts not commercial enough for a good idea if you're lucky enough they'll give you an answer most of the times you won't even get an answer but you can bypass that if you have a book that's a little corky are different and you think is worth ... story worth telling or an idea worth expressing and that is self publishing through one of the major major uh outlets\nAnd I'm promoting it through that service as well by buying some ads and what happens is people will read it if they like it\nYou'll get noticed and then it'll sell and then you go to a publisher at that point where the pre sale of X number of copies it doesn't mean it's gonna work\nNor does it mean if it doesn't work that your book is invalid that could mean in your book is fabulous and the work of genius but the people just aren't ready for I'll give an example as ... as successful as I Am\nWith my commercial books stop mass hysteria being example number one right now going back God faith and reason Trump's war and the other stuff coming civil war you name it\nI self published on Kendall a couple of books last year including xenon actually and I went I actually think it's the greatest work of genius I've ever written\nIt hasn't sold more than a couple of hundred copies it actually makes me happy to understand that the book is so far ahead of time\nIn that it's not popular enough for the times I had publishes look at it they they were terrified of it\nBecause it shows a post feminist world that's act absolutely indicative of where we are going especially after the Kavanaugh hearings if you're talking about a mass killing men that was about a physical reality rather than a a psychological reality so it hasn't sold but it doesn't determine for thinking it's one of my best books\nAnyway that's what I'm trying to say is you gotta keep on keep on keep on doing it don't let anyone tell you know and don't rely on any one person for the opinion of what your work is worth okay back in a minute\nDrawing the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred Savage eight by four hundred seven to eight to ... just\nThe court last considered this law known as the Ferris doctrine in Nineteen eighty seven\nUpholding it in a five to four decision in his dissent Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the case was wrongly decided and deserves a universal criticism it is not known if the current Supreme Court will agree to take up the case of lieutenant Rebecca Daniel\nWith Fox on justice Hank winds on Fox News [noise]\n[noise] hello everybody I've read Davis and yes I Am with Paul this is Ellie just what my parole officer told me I Am with you I Can't believe I was you every morning and I is that doesn't third day the third the fourth day I started to shake a little\n... and I never did before I don't know what causes that but ... will be bad together on Thursday morning six to nine you'll be hearing from fight am on the talk of Connecticut and\nWBRC am WBRC FM ... three Hartford W s n G ...
