towards America from Honduras I think this election largely ends up a push\nTo another was neither side gains a lot or loses a lot even on the house side\nEven on the ... even in the U.S house I I I I think that um is there some very interesting numbers out there if you if you break them down and that you know the national generic ballot is interesting it shows the Democrats have\nJust on average about an eight and a half point lead right now right important to remember that in Nineteen Ninety four um they had a three point lead on election day and they lost control the house for the first time in four years in the fifties sweet same fifty feet swing\nUm there's a little bit more defined polling ABC had to pull out last week that looked at the sixty seats where their ratings\nUm the reading them toss up or leans that they're not that they're not put away and in those in in in that the the the generic ballot was margin of error I Am I just wonder why a book is led by one point\nWhen you see these other metrics Peter like the president's ah favorability rating is about where Obama's was at this point in Obama's president you know I Know we had a sad\nOr economy back then but that's part of what plays into whether people have a positive impression on Trump's numbers among black voters are almost unbelievable I mean to go from eight percent an election day in sixteen two twenty three percent almost triple and then to go to thirty six percent now\nAnd that's usually a group of voters that the Democrats practically own lock stock and barrel\nIt that's right and it it's interesting in terms of perspective I think Trump disease a poll out today um I it may be Rasmussen um\nThat shows that Obama that that Trump's popularity is actually a little bit higher than Obama's was at this point going into the midterms but if you if you think back and remember the coverage in that in that in that first two years Obama was regarded as a wildly popular president\nWho had a who had a hard core conservative\nUm dislike\nFor him but that did he was popular\nUm the media today looks the same numbers and say well Trump is unpopular and that's because Trump is unpopular with the people who are looking at the numbers not because it's the way the country feels about him and and and this is part of the part of the problem with with with the election forecasting\nUm is when you um you know what the what the metrics you use help determine the results and if you put garbage and you're gonna get garbage out\nWell the other thing and and I keep reminding people have this if you took any single subject\nAnd had the entire national news media spend two years telling you how bad\nActs was at the end of two years you'd have Americans thinking just about as low on opinion of whatever axe was as possible and they've done that to Trump's rise as you pointed out they've done they did the polar opposite with with Obama they had tangles up the leg and they they thought he walked on water and\nThey they they believed all those things about him and they said\nAnd how how dare you other nationally known radio talk show how come out and say you want Obama to fail\nI'm Wondering at ... and that is yeah and and how long that was\nUm and now I'm ... ... people ethically jumping down in cheerleading for Trump to fail and ... that's the sense that voice of America it's wonderful it's it's terrific it's phenomenal um so perception has a lot to do with it but I I think right now the balance of power\nUm the the people who are really going to determine which way this election is going to go\nOur suburban let's call them establishment Republicans are Bush Republicans they're not necessarily driven by issues they're not necessarily driven by one particular thing um but they sort of look at look at look at the whole\nUniverse of things and they've always been Republicans and they didn't like the Trump tweets and they didn't like the way he behaved in the campaign and the way that he talked to Jeb Bush in the way that he talked to John cases in their ... you know the Access Hollywood tape make some kind of uncomfortable um\nAnd so they may have been turned off to the Republicans but then they saw what the Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so they may have been turned off to the Republicans but then they saw what the Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh mostly I Wonder I haven't always one of them\nWas that planned is the early October surprise was supposed to dismantle the president and everybody behind him and now the caravan is the second October surprise do they have time and the next of of fourteen Thirteen Days\nOr sorry fourteen days to be able to make a difference with another surprise that dropped so late in the game that there isn't any practical ability to respond to it\nWell it ... there's always that possibility of again this is why field for example fear for example something like a leak coming from what his purported to be the Mueller investigation\nThat says that after the election and after the deadlines I've ... the statutory deadlines to pass the president is going to be indicted\nOr you know let them in day she'll be ... for bank fraud or um indicted him for corrupt foreign practices or nothing to do with Russian collusion nothing to do with anything we've already covered that that\nThat the people are tired of hearing about that something new something sexy um you'll you'll recall how everybody was protecting it was the it was the end of end of days and and the crack of doom for Trump when they gave immunity to this hallowed who'd been a long time um CFO the Trump Organization um the\nThe explosion with which the New York times\nUm dissected Fred trumps stolen tax returns which also has apparently turned out to be nothing uh and and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of last minute\nI'm Sunday afternoon a explosively lease on the Internet\nSome scandalous story\nA ditch attempt it it's an attempt to um discredit the president and drive down Republican turnout is it that's really what a lot of these negative stories are about and what a lot of this continuous negative um\nPoll analysis is about it's about voter suppression it's about telling the Republicans\nYou're going to lose don't feel bad be ashamed don't show up don't ...\nI'm Talking to Peter ... Peter I got a wrap it up but I got to tell you\nSome of the things though that the left seems to think of as slams on Trump I listen to a discussion about a week ago of this giant piece of the New York times did on all the efforts by Trump's father to put money into accounts\nGood for me why do you hate this\nAnd they've decided well okay that's why you get things like this vox is reporting tonight the numbers are in and Trump is up so despite all the negative publicity of the last two years and especially the last two months\nA Rasmussen poll shows the President Trump is more popular at this point in his presidency than President Obama was\nAnd at times the difference is almost ten percent\nThe poll released by the wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Trump's approval is the highest it's been since he was elected and I'll remind you\nHe's more popular than Obama was at the time Obama got nothing but great press the first two two years he was in office frankly he got it most of the eight years that it was an office\nBut the first two years were almost it was this slobbering love affair between the mainstream fake stream press and Brock Obama meanwhile Trump got exactly the opposite\nEvery reporter with the TV camera or a microphone or an Internet Web page was telling you all the reasons you should have Donald Trump\nSo with all that he is now beating Obama by as much as ten points it's extraordinary let's go to Diane Diane you've heard is talking about and talking about that invasion caravan is headed north that I Know is going to reach our border before election day what's your take on it\nNow allies longtime listener first time college thank you very concerned and thinking I'm very concerned about this and there's one thing\nThat I've never heard anybody talk about this is the human history huge thing that's kind of based on land behind ... who is feeding him who's clothing and what about sanitation where they said what about what will I mean\nI've heard on the TV oh well you know the Mexicans are handing them on stuff like that and you know it doesn't ... ...\nAnd on the TV oh well you know the Mexicans are handing a lot of stuff like that and you know it doesn't it can tell you the public domain\nDiane I earlier this hour you and I are thinking on the same lines because earlier this hour I was asking out loud as I began the hour\nWho is doing all that if you assume let's say it's less expensive because it's Mexico and you're not eating and some tourist place let's suppose you could feed seven thousand adults on five dollars a day a day not a meal so you could feed 'em on five dollars that's thirty five thousand dollars a day\nSomebody is put money up somewhere and my guess is the people in the caravan don't have that kind of money they've also said that they are going to be moving them by buses now\nWill seven thousand people in Seventy people per buzz is a hundred buses a hundred drivers a hundred diesel supplies to be able to move Seventy buses or or or a hundred buses north was Seventy people each individual ten thousand\nThen it's a hundred buses I mean that's that's a substantial bill no matter where you go\nIt's unbelievable it's just the LA oh I Love it a little kid on the play he's really got to get really still get the military and\nI think that's what he's going to do and if he does he's sending those financial messages I just talked about a moment ago by the way I Want to tell you about this a federal judge this came from a hearing on friday\nA federal judge says the U.S State Department was providing cover for the Clintons that the state department provided false statements this federal judge\nUnabashedly accused careers State Department officials of lying and signing clearly ... to derail a series of lawsuits seeking information about former secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her handling of the twenty twelve terrorist attack on the U.S consulate in Benghazi\n... are you seeing how much time and attention is being spent on Jamal could show gate the man who was apparently murdered in the Saudi conflict in Turkey and his ...\nDo you remember how little attention was paid to the Americans who died in ...

for all this\nAnd who benefits from it not Donald Trump although at some point this may be one of the best illustrations of why America needs a border wall something just a little bit stronger than the gates that this hoard broke through as they left Guatemala and entered Mexico over this past weekend\nBlind to have you with me on the Lars Larson Joe Democrats love to ride the friends when

be legal if you were a minor at the time and that caravan of illegals from Honduras quite coincidental for the midterm elections\nIs this part of the October surprise the Democrats seem to come up with every time there is a major election in America and take just a moment to cast a vote my Twitter poll here's a question and and based on the fact\nThat the New York times is reporting the Trump Administration is considering defining gender\nNow if you're thinking to yourself well Lars already know a gender is you're either a boy or you're a girl and if you're born a boy than you stay a boy if you're born a girl you stay a girl you can change your outward appearance you can change your clothing you could even go to a surgeon or if you want to and make some physical changes in your body\nBut the chromosomes that make up whether you're male or female\nThey stayed the same no matter what your DNA stays the same unless you're Elizabeth Warren in which case you can look as hard as far as you can to see if you can find some Native American blood in your background yeah that's that she created her own problem with that so\nThis is the way the New York times but it's at the Trump Administration considering narrowly defining gender as a biological condition determined by ... at the genitalia bird the most drastic\nMove yet wow drastic\nTo go back to saying it's boys and girls and a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protection of transgender people we've talked about there's a lot on the program a series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened up the legal concept of gender in federal program so in other words\nIt's the new light bulbs she was a lot less energy so we save money on our electric bill by using an energy saving incandescent CFL

frequent bases in the news these days and all\nOver the last week or so the biggest story has been a massive caravan of people I call it the invasion caravan\nThat is headed toward America's southern border they are still a little under two thousand miles away but they seem to be making pretty good speed at this point they've already busted through the wall of the barricades\nOr to get out of Guatemala to get into Mexico and now I'm actually goes apparently just law allowing this massive caravan to head north toward the United states a lot of talk about that with Maria as for knows who's the national director of the remembrance project where You're welcome back to the program\nSo Lance thanks so much for having me on again\nSo is this the October surprise that the Democrats usually a plan for every every ... every major election America\n[laughter] right they orchestrated and then they try to place blame on President Trump's shoulders and you're trying to make him look like that and an evil person in the Republican Party as the evil when I was trying to do is to protect our borders\nAnd in fact the president said if he needs to both the military on the border you think that's what we're up against because this caravan started at one thousand it's now supposed to be seven thousand or greater ... their numbers that are greater than that not now by the time it hits the border if he keeps growing the way it has been\nIt could be over ten thousand people trying to get into the United states all of the same time\nI think the military the only way that we're going to stop this invasion and according to a chief Manny ... out of the charging the sector the Rio Grande valley sector and\nAnd a Texas ... he mentioned in the last two weeks there were fifty four hundred family units coming through\nAnd they say is in advance of that care of and you know also you know they captured a gang members cartels and of course there were over\nSeven hundred pounds of marijuana and other drugs I think it's it's overwhelming for the ice and for the border patrol agents um there has to beat them help there and that's what he's asking boys will be enforced\nI thought we might actually get some help from Mexico when President Trump last week said he said to Mexico if you don't help us stop this then we may end up with no trade deal whatsoever and I thought initially Mexico was trying to help but now I guess not\nRight and just think of it this way and I think that that Mexico of course is helping the Democrat Party and should\nUm [noise] the Democrats win this mid term they would of course move again to impeach President Trump and they would implement their far left agenda so this is a win situation for Mexico and and you know like a large that they have no intention in stopping this invasion\nNo and in fact that they can get Trump out of the way and if they can take away one house of Congress then they stop him from passing anything as a bill which pushes them back\nTo the only other thing he has available his executive orders and I've been very proud that this president has not used executive orders in place of legislation the way his predecessor did so frequently\nWhat else can we do to get this thing's stop\nWell I think that the American people need to speak up and they certainly need to be showing their support and making their voices heard calling the White House it to zero to four five six\nEleven eleven and telling President Trump will be supporting him Alisa park place in the military on the border in order to stop the invasion and protect America and American Line and also I think that we need to go ahead and them obviously go vote and vote for those who will\nStand for securing our border and for America first agenda that President Trump is pushing forward that he can't do it alone you know we can send you use the military we can\nTake that trade deal off the table and you can you know we can also um implements\nUse the military we can take that trade deal off the table and you can you know we can also um implement some sort of um I Would say additional\nFees are assessed fees wherever possible like their remittance fees you know Mexico has assessed fees for the money going into their country from the United states you know let's take it back on that and really make them feel the pain because every man's fees\nThat that gardeners the Mexico and Mexico\nJust about two billion dollars a month on those remittances that is why the from the money wired into Mexico you know they\nHave every intention again to continue that flow of money and to push their citizens um onto the American taxpayer while trying to collect the U.S foreign aid and U.S foreign aid has to be taken off the table as well and\nHey Murray or would you mind reminding my audience about them remember and project and what that is all about\nWhat led to we started in two thousand nine as a voice for victims killed by illegal aliens and naturally Lars November fourth of this year we're going to recognize the national day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens\nThis is our seventh year to recognize this national day I'll be one to make sure that this issue is not swept under the rug once again and you know President Trump have also asked him to officially a nationally proclaimed this\n... remembrance I'm so that we can fix the problem you know these families are American families are permanently separated from their loved ones\nNever to see them again until they reach heaven\nAll one hundred percent preventable and it's the lack of the spine and courage and doing the right thing that these politicians who I elected to do and protect America\nAnd follow our constitution and that's the reason why there are ... are wonderful falling Americans who have lost their lives\nSo you know we we do we also Lars has a\nChaplain see group and a crisis intervention group where we help the family and get the help that they need\nMe psychologically emotionally to sell you know we're doing a lot of things which is so very great oh that President Trump has the Exxon with on this issue and listened to I ate all moms and dads but you know we had to get off the stuff that they get our friends and family and to help out and speak out\nYou know the only ideas I dad do yours I liked the idea of taxing the remittances but I think there may be an easier way to do it um\nYou know the the IRS has all kinds of rules even for American citizens if you go down to your bank for some reason and deposit around ten thousand dollars the IRS gets notified because they know that they don't want people hiding cash Bible feeling a lot of the remittance money that is sent back is money that's earned is cash\nBy illegal aliens who are working illegally in this country and when they send it out of the country by going down to a convenience store a place where they can buy Western Union money order and send it to their families it effectively hides it for tax purposes and I have a feeling a lot of it was was as they've not pay taxes on it so say\nIf you're a legal American citizen or a green card holder you have a Social Security number if you want to send money by Western Union\nSay more than a hundred dollars a at a time you're gonna have to show Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee and you could make the feet produced up you could make it five or ten percent and said this is a way of reminding folks ah that that you are not going to be able to dodge the tax man\nAnd that we understand that if you're saying that money's south or we can stop you from sending the money but we could say you have to have Social Security number or it's a five or ten percent of the\nThe other thing I Would suggest to Americans as we're heading into the fall where it gets cold in most parts of America a lot of people decide to take vacation time and sometimes they vacation in Mexico both because you know there's a lot of sun and because it's inexpensive it might be a good\nIdea I don't sponsor boycotts because I think my audience are smart enough to make their own decisions\nBut have a vacation in the United states and skip Mexico and ... send the message that if they're willing to help people invade our country then we don't need to be spending tourist dollars which are also important to Mexico Maria what's the website ... for the remembrance\nBecause they couldn't afford coverage until Republicans were killed that tax of course Democrats would like to put it back in place but it's not good enough to get rid of the penalty to get rid of the individual mandate if you don't also have deregulation and there's nothing for people to choose their no ...\nLike to put it back in place but it's not good enough to get rid of the penalty to get rid of the individual mandate if you don't also have deregulation and there's nothing for people to choose their no non Obamacare options available even if Obamacare's voluntary rather than mandatory unless you also have\nThe deregulation or the regulatory steps that we've seen from the Trump Administration and Democrats are basically saying look if we can't mandate Obamacare\nLet's ban all the other options that people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's a you know if our guys were any\nGood at talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that things are horrible though from them\nAnd they somehow said we're protecting preexisting condition or a provision\nWhich makes no sense because this you know they're basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability and the short term market well you know if you get sick and develop a preexisting condition guaranteed renew ability is a great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet that's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind\nOf made their talking points on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it to the extent they paid attention at all\nYou know fill over the weekend I heard more people talking about pre existing conditions\n... I I Want to I Want you to testify numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out altogether once and for all and here's how I Do it I've talked to a few different experts including balancing the coin you and others who knows this issue well and they say you know for all the talking about pre existing conditions the total number of people who\nMeet that description is about four hundred thousand and they base that on the number of people who signed up with Obamacare for pre existing conditions and the number of people who are in risk pools before Obamacare came along is four hundred thousand people out of three hundred and thirty million people in this country and the total cost of covering those people it's a high premium it averages\nThirty two thousand dollars a year but in terms of a national\nPolicy is twelve billion dollars is a drop in the bucket in a federal budget that is four thousand billion dollars and you need twelve dollars twelve billion dollars to cover it if we passed a law that said if you are you know judge to have\nA pre existing condition and it's not it's one that actually takes a lot of money to cover then we're just going to cover you were just period unless you you know or make more than five hundred thousand dollars years I mean you could set some income limits on and you knock that\nIssue out altogether and say now let's solve the rest of the problem was let the private sector do most of it and the only other big issue I'm aware of is the one where people say but if you're going along happy\nAnd healthy and some things strikes you down you need a above a triple quadruple bypass\nOr you need a liver transplant or something like that say fine let's so catastrophic plans ... not have the government do it well it's had the private sector of the government were to say to the private sector insurance folks hey can you come up with a product out so they called the insurance industry my wife used to work for ...\nLike a long time ago um have a product that will cover you for catastrophes\nRight it's a kind of coverage most people have if they paid off their cars just one policy the company you're only if things go completely terribly wrong and those can be sold very cheaply to now you've covered people for catastrophic loss you've covered all the people the four hundred thousand that are that have pre existing conditions now the rest of it for the most part\nIs the stuff where people wanted Obamacare to pay for maintenance basically they wanted you to pay for everything from birth control pills to your annual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance any more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car now my wrong on the numbers and I'm getting this wrong\nI I Would I Would disagree only was your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely high deductible\nWe are all paying these very high premium so we're not getting coverage on any of that routine stuff or even a\nMore expensive stuff than that and so you know the the perverse\nEffect here is that we've got essentially high deductible plans but we're paying a fortune in premiums for them anyway and then there's no other there's no other choices available because of the regulatory structure um you know that these number four hundred thousand might be right I\nThink that ah it's probably a little on the high end because the first four years after Obamacare passed before the exchanges launched there was something called the preexisting condition insurance plan\nWhich massively subsidized people with preexisting conditions so they could get coverage if they were uh you know uninsured because the exchanges hadn't launched it and they the total\nEnrollment and that was about a hundred and twenty nine thousand now might get a lot of money I'd run out of money prematurely say maybe they were twice or three times as many people that wanted to go and what have you is that if it hadn't run out of money but I think if anything has a high estimate from that the\nSo maybe it's a couple of hundred thousand it's the kind of thing that is a very affluent\nCountry a wealthy country like ours could easily say if you're one of those people with a ... a catastrophic metal medical condition her condition that goes on for a long time and it's a preexisting condition that caused a huge amount of money to cover we could cover it and we could say that's\nMedical condition her condition that goes on for a long time and it's a pre existing condition caused a huge amount of money to cover we could cover it and we could say that's something we ought to do as a society unless you're already getting it through your work will

question is what do we do with that giant caravan that is\nHeading toward America's border and is full of people who have some have burned American flags waved to their own flags from the home countries there from an indicator day desire to come into the United states and not necessarily do it legally either\nThey called themselves refugees but you have to remember the refugee has a specific meaning in the law and I've asked John's mirror to join those senior editor at the stream and author of the new politically incorrect guide the immigration John good to have you back on\nThank you good to be although this is a very grim occasion\nIt is and tell me why\nThis is an invasion by can keep the doors let's just call it what it is these people are no more refugees than Cortez and his soldiers were when they arrived in Mexico they're non agree with you\nYeah they're not asking permission to come into our country because they're genuine refugee first of all a refugee is someone who is persecuted by his government the way Jews were persecuted by Nazi Germany and they sell to the United states\nAnd tragically France Franklin Roosevelt ... away those Jews on those boats people and like you know it would end up like an Frank or not waving Nazi flags they will not screaming about how they're going to carry out on a\nNazi German traditions and culture in the United states\nOkay what when you see people claiming the refugee status and they're waving the flag of the country that allegedly persecute them maybe it's time to be suspicious\nAnd by the way they don't fit the asylum seeker label either do there\nNo no ... on either of those cats they should\nStay in the first safe country they reach now of course they were perfectly safe in Honduras or wherever they came from but they're pretending they were at the moment they got to Mexico they should apply for for asylum or refugee status and they're not doing it\nTo not let a single one of these people not one into this country I don't care if we have to\nSet the Rio Grande on fire the way the Cuyahoga caught fire in the seventies this cannot happen\nI agree with you because John weren't going to get more\nSet the Rio Grande on fire the way the Cuyahoga caught fire in the seventies this cannot happen\nNot agree with you because John we're going to get more of this and you know what probably set this off most recently and tell me if I'm wrong about this\nDrew Donald Trump adopted a zero tolerance policy and the Democrats treated like a hobby horse and said no you can't do that because you're separating parents from children many of the adults were not the parents of those children friday of them had no connection at all we know that\nBecause some of them some of the parents some of the adults I should say we're told you you can go home do you want to take your kids with you know I'm leaving I'm here well that's because they weren't really connected they were probably assisting in trafficking those kids but the\nRise in aged child pornography or a slave labor and the Obama administration ... uh let ten thousand kids do with the people who claimed to be their parents and they found the working as slave labor as an egg factories and I in Idaho\nSo the bottom line is is is that these people will try to cross the border illegally and I've had people saying well you know they can't do this or to bigger group I think they are planning to overwhelm the border patrol knowing that\nYou know I mean we see this on a smaller scale do we have fifty illegals encounter a half a dozen border patrol agents those agents may be able to stop half\nA dozen people or or a dozen people but many of them get right on by so if you swarmed the border with seven thousand or who knows it maybe ten thousand because this thing has been growing like crazy over the last week or so it went from one thousand and four thousand announce seven and\nMay be headed for ten they get to the border and their ten thousand strong\nHow in the world are you going to stop them short of using the option that President Trump says he will use and that's the military\nOh absolutely we should use the military and we should we hit them drones flying over them now dropping leaflets telling them that they're not welcome and as they approach the border we should have maybe drone spraying with Cathy or something and these people need to be ... they need to know that we will use what ever force is necessary\nIncluding deadly force if they if they attack our border guards and kill them if they trample them\nIn the military will use violent force this is an invasion of our country by foreign mob if we have on this\nThe entire population of Latin America is going to walk across the land bridge into the United states and then the entire at large parts of the population of the Muslim world will get on boats the way they're doing in the Mediterranean they will sales in the United states ... ... we will be inundated it will be over\nAnd he was an existential crisis the United states of America and by the way it is on us and we want exist or not\nYou know John these are not all Hondurans are Guatemalans or Mexicans they're finding apparently there are people there from Bangladesh which is another uh apparently in the first the first nine ten months of this year we've seen six hundred Bangladeshis cross into the United states\nOver those our southern border so they say\nThere's long been relating operation the relationship between al ... who did the nine eleven attacks and Central American cartels like MS Thirteen\nSo that means that they've seen this is the way to get in don't try to sneak in through a regular port of entry fly into South America Central America come north on buses or whatever where you can find your way north get past\nThe borders and then just to enter the United states surreptitiously across a wide open borders maybe we should take some of the tens of millions that we're going to take away from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador as punishment for them not helping us with this problem and spend it on building a wall\nWe absolutely have to build we need to build a wall electrified and Senate on fire and this is this is out wages and it's being ginned up just in time for the elections and I think I Know why I mean there are activists walking around handing out money organizing buses and trucks down there\nThis is not a spontaneous movement is no political ... and it's got your sources\nGreasy fingerprints all over ... people say well why why would they do that so close to the election don't they realize it's going to help the Republicans they don't think it will they think Trump will cave the way he caved over separating families and they think if they can get across the border he will cave and the Republican base will be so depressed\nDiscussing dispirited that they won't turn out to vote\nNo but but you know John over the weekend I tweeted out that when I saw the video of this crowd coming up to the gates\nLeaving Guatemala and going across the bridge in New Mexico and they simply burst through the gates wrecked you know rip them down and went on through and then the crowded that bridge wall you know from edge to edge with with illegal aliens or future I mean they weren't crossed\nAnd on through and then the crowded that bridge wall you know from edge to edge would with illegal aliens or future I mean they weren't crossing into Mexico legally [noise] so I think I could still called them illegal aliens because they weren't entering through any kind of process I said this is the best the ad\nFor Donald Trump's wall but I've seen in a long time but you're right if the Democrats have calculated if we force the president to threaten to use the military and then he doesn't and they cross in\n... Republicans and conservatives will be a demoralized by that\nAbsolutely but if if the ... yeah if they break out fences and march onto a bridge like that we need to blow up the Brits before they get to it\nThey met if they escalate we escalate well we can I mean I Would try to avoid casually blow it up before they reach that they can't be allowed to clarify that because you know I said well no they get to it\nYeah because they're not foreign combatants but I Would say we use everything we can and what is the United states military I mean our military is great winning wars but they also know how to guard a perimeter and if you would have already gotten around his dad the perimeter is now the edge of our country make sure nobody comes in I think we were\nLearning the borders of Afghanistan why can't we guard the borders of the United states I mean really a Donald Trump aides to open a military bases\nIt's very difficult for and I think this is set up to have you know media response and and and good video that they can put on YouTube\nBut they failed to remember that there had been assassination attempts and there are people that will tag\nAlong with the masses when Eric I'm putting a or a variety of yelling and screaming match it so they can get closer to a candidate we know that John Hinckley junior was a very very close to president\nBefore he actually shot George Wallace was shot 'em by an assassin who was yelling at people in the crowd that they were cheering loudly enough or George Wallace so what people don't understand when they sit there and say well why did you act\nThis why why did you um move away or run away or not address these people who are approaching you are in public and screaming at you with its with good reason you have no idea what their motivations are motivations of the ... people in the protest maybe\nHonorable if you can call them honorable may be disrespectful but they're they don't need any harm but the public officials had to be concerned about others who may be tagging along with the same thing with law enforcement was somebody approaches a vehicle the officer has no idea if that person is going to ask directions\nOr if that person is trying to get close to them or for that purpose we've seen a tax\nOn law enforcement where two or three people were saying hey why don't you get away from that guy is not you know given the past\nDon't arrest them and then someone comes up be based on the officer being distracted then physically attacked them\nYou know I've seen that myself land so I told you I used to go on a lot of ride along and I'd I'd have officers who say watch\nIf we're going on are arrested for shoplifting at a\nAt a convenience store and in particular neighborhoods we'd have a crowd of fifty people standing round is very quickly and you don't know which ones are just looking lose and which ones are potentially dangerous to the officer but there was a lot of that shouted and then more recently we've seen a tax on General Mattis and\nOthers you know attempts to take their lives or rice and\nIt's as though there's just a whole\nYou know sort of spectrum of different ways that anybody an authority or or a political position is is being attacked\nA police officer is part of that he's where the rubber meets the road you know when it comes to government policy we have laws we have to have men and women in uniform who enforce them and now they're being viewed as as a potential target by people who have some kind of beef either against society or against the laws or against the enforcement of laws\nAnd you know we heard a there's a video out you can find and I I tend not to talk about these people there's only in the air anymore airplay but there's a video out as a woman has questioned about a kitten a neighbor who shot a cop and she just looks at the parents it's so big deal he shot a cop\nYou know these are the officers that are going into communities that other people wouldn't go to on a bet with all of their doors locked in their windows rolled up and you know they're going in there and trying to make a difference or they just responding\nTo calls from health for help from law abiding citizens that live there that you know are trying to have their kids weight on a school bus without somebody tried selling drugs\nAnd and how do we get on top of that if the whole community is so distrustful of the cops that they take that attitude that if a cop was shot so what I mean that that you know I Want\nOff of that if the whole community is so distrustful of the cops that they take that attitude that if a cop was shot so what I mean\nThat that you know I Want the cops to go home alive every single night but I also want them to be able to go into a community and get real communication that might help them find the person who's ... you know child trafficking or the person who's selling dope inherent community and that kind of attitude from members of the community is just not helpful at all\n[noise] tell it's not in the way that you combative is you start telling the story of all the good things officers do every day\nUh we see it all the time and and you have to yell louder people say well you know I talked about what happened no you need to yell out or if there's an officer that does something in your community that benefit everybody put it on every social media on you can imagine\nCalled a news until they do a story about it and there's they they're doing things everyday law enforcement officers do things every day that are not in their job description and just to protect people you know we had floods in Austin we had a terrible hurricane they came through\nGeorgia and Florida and you can find reports of officer is going to work\nWhen their houses didn't exist as a matter of fact there's a company called relentless to enter in Texas the great company they found out that Oscar some of the new uniforms just completely blew away so they started printing T shirts that said police home so they would have some way to patrol the communities\nYou know while their families have been shipped out and evacuated they're still staying in the community to protect the people that are strangers to them\nLance is the author of winning cops killing blue news the profits go to police officer charities or ... an attorney and a

I'm Glad you mentioned yes it's clear whether you agree with the president or not he has the constitutional authority to defend the borders\nAnd you know something we're starting to come back now there are many in the Puerto Rican yes\nThat don't life don't like what's happening with\nFolks coming in because they had to work to get it here I mean that is taking calls here Brad for numerous ... years um you know a well Puerto Rico's obviously part of the u._s. but folks who of emigrated from you know Central America South America Europe and said wait\nA minute wait a minute\nI waited\nI got the money together it's very expensive to become a citizen of people don't realize that twenty thirty forty thousand dollars in fees I waited I got a sponsor family I went through the mountains of paperwork and\nBrad you're right some of the hardest and most stringent opposition to illegal immigration comes from immigrants who came here legally\nSo you know\nThis is why I'm reading speaking of polling I'm reading where some of the Democrats are frustrated they can't crack a certain number with Latino voters and Hispanic voters part of the reason is\nThat a lot of these Latino and Hispanic voters do not like the lax\nEnforcement of illegal immigration there you go because they came here and then like ... ... well yeah they they actually they actually a percentage of them applaud Trump for his stance on that so well I'll tell you it's going to be a quite an election white and he he certainly will Yes sir Yes sir okay twenty\nEight minutes after the hour of the six o'clock in the morning and Paul is back with me and that yes he's going to be with me he'll be gone once in a while you get these e has to have a little bit of rest and uh it some of those Kansas City brings along with him and a\n... there it is [noise] do that because they think I'd make this uh [noise] there it is\nOh my God [laughter] oh my God I Wish supplements rather only supplement it certainly are supplement as they're doing a fabulous job of supplementing\nNine ten eleven twelve point gap on the Republicans in this thing so they're probably and from all the other things I'm reading over the weekend Brad they're probably close to flipping the house maybe not maybe yes [noise]\nFrom all the other things I'm reading over the weekend Brad they're probably close to flipping the house maybe not maybe yes\nIt's going to be I don't I I yeah some reason I don't know what it is I don't think they're going to flip the house yeah\nHere it is and in the most competitive house battleground districts\nThat preference is not nine points it's tied\nWell yeah there you go yeah so it's high it's tied in the most competitive districts absolutely I'm ...

know I think he's still around doing some commentary on CBS\nAnd he addresses in the book how we got here to this polarization and he said something very interesting he said nobody in Washington today really knows each other any elaborated he said you know\nWhen it was expensive\nTo travel back and forth if he were elected as a member of Congress from Missouri\nOr Kansas or Idaho or Indiana he said in the thirties forties and fifties where you know you had to take a train to get to Washington once you were there in the fall you didn't go home until the holidays and then you came right back Bob Schieffer set it so well in the book he said you know\nCheap airfare all of a sudden when you can hop on a plane and be home with a couple of hours he said in his mind that was the downfall or the beginning of the downfall of politics because he said you know in the in the thirties forties fifties when it was expensive to travel\nThe family's all stayed in Washington and they got to know each other they got to know each other now he had parties and well it that's it they socialize he said Bob Schieffer said you have no idea how many pieces\nThey got to know each other now he had parties and well it's that they socialize he said Bob Schieffer said you have no idea how many pieces of legislation got hammered out\nNodding Congress on the golf course\nHe said you would have members of both parties playing golf with each other or going out to dinner at night having a few cocktails and at a table on a napkin drafting up legislation but now and he's right people to I'm not a lot of people don't realize\nCongress gambles out late Thursday Afternoon they all jump on their planes or go home they don't come back until Monday Night and they're only in session like three days a

who won that they know they are so they're all you know Brad\nAnd uh the information that we have a crunch through your twenty six game\nShows that it's still a problem you know we're in the ... the national team drivers safety week\nUh which runs from Sunday through some Monday he and the you know we use this time the highlights the need to have more and better training for teen drivers and the numbers that we looked at a really pretty startling\nLet me let me ask you about about this when you get the teams in the car\nAnd is there anything that can be created I don't mean to be punishment or anything like that but anything that can be created\nTo make them understand that this is dangerous business because it's incredible the number of crashes we have many of them right here in Connecticut\nThat's right well the most important thing is training to get that young drivers much supervised driving as necessary most states only require fifty hours of supervise driving or with an adult driver\nI'm we think it should be at least one hundred dollars\nAnd we think we're doing that that the team driver will be exposed to a sort of voice of reason if you will you know and the numbers point that out because we looked at crashes where the drivers were involved in this big holiday was involved and we found that if the team driver had attuned passenger\nThat the likelihood of a fatal crash increase by fifty one percent wow with 'em but yet for that team driver had an older passenger older driver and we're talking about thirty five years or older the likelihood of a crash decreased\nBy eight percent so it shows very starkly that that voice of reason is they're\nSort of keeping the teen on the straight and narrow as opposed to when they might have another teen passenger in the vehicle and as you can imagine in that scenario that there probably isn't a lot of concentration on the road being done\nA laughing joking playing and you're listening to the radio all that sort of things that it creates a distraction before driver that has already lacking the skills and experience to really be a confident driver in ...\nI'm just going to say are are are do you think ah school base drivers and programs in driving schools\nAre they doing their part in this or are they just doing what their state minimums require them to do how are they doing if you looked at that at all\nSchool both face drivers that is a good start laid the foundation of what's necessary to to get the team to understand and appreciate the road or if you engage in some supplemental behind the wheel drive or training that's excellent but we don't\nWe think that there's there's no substitute for a parrot the person who's in that most of both already position for that young driver to give them the necessary training and by practicing and really and starting off in low risk situations time gradually moving to situation\nRobert you give them any less safe training can by practicing and really and starting off in low risk situations\nPaint gradually moving to a situation in a more complex like highways nighttime driving driving here in the rain on them around and challenging roadways like very Kirby roadways and limiting the number of non family team passengers that can be in that vehicle but\nYou know training training training our website has lots of material of videos that show proper training proper or driving practice\nIn various situations and the parents\nTeam driver contracts where it was understood that there will be consequences for any violations of rules and really in the high tech world that we're in there there's lots of technology\nThat can be used to monitor that tune remotely you might have seen the commercial where a teenager is driving or a particular brand of vehicle and out dancing in the woods and his parents drive up because they were able to monitor him\nOr the fact that it was not wearing should've bang or a pass the time that it should have been driving that can be done with a technology that's available and new vehicles or it's it's available in the after market you can set up\nA geographic sense an area that the teen drivers should stay in order to stay out of a you can track them in real time abide by a GPS in a bed geo fence arrangement is violated you can get a text message there's all sorts of ways\nOf being able to monitor that human drivers from afar it might seem like big brother\nBut we're talking about saving lives here so you don't think there's too much that you can do in order to prevent the death of not only tune driver and passenger but more and more according to the number that we've looked at\nA people outside of that teen drivers vehicles are being killed including other drivers but ... and cyclists\nRobert Sinclair spokesman for AAA northeast Robert I have a question that I've been dying to ask you are when you came on again and you're here again\nA Connecticut I'm sure it's no different than any other state we have got a racing I'm telling you right now in this state you have no idea\nThe cars are in and out the new cards the movie I Believe\nAnd if you watch the TV commercials all the new cars\nEvery time there and moved out there they're going and you know they're going fast I mean it's almost like a race and I think\nThat the people that are buying these cars say hey boy it looks good on TV let us do it let's get out there and I think that is the reason for some other speeding that we have to consider a here and the state of Connecticut I really believe that\nI wouldn't argue if no one bread and now it's a very interesting because now we're seeing ads\nAnd the cars are drifting through the streets you know three or four of 'em in tandem spinning the tires smoking the roadway and I remember about Fifteen Years ago during the super bowl there was a commercial where they show children in cars\nThat were flying through the air obviously a fantasy peace nothing to do with reality people lost their mind this is sending such terrible messages we shouldn't be showing these kinds of images it's terrible and here we are years later\nThey're showing in very very stark reality\nPosted responsible type of driving that each imagine things that were ... you probably thrown in jail in most mean there's a ... that people were really doing it and of course they always have the little a disclaimer at the bottom of the spring there you know this professional driver closed course do not exempt\nPuts you're right it it said bad images and\nYou know we were gone a long way from showing children and cars lying to the beer which was obviously a fantasy\nAnd it caused an uproar just showing\nPeople driving on street spinning tired and smoking and drifting and nobody\nSays the word\nWell again I thank you so much we both do for being with us a call ... and myself and uh again uh I Know we'll have you with us again but uh it's it's just

pleasure\nTo have a Heather summers senator with us or she really gets in the end she digs it out I'm telling you right now she's a a terrific a state senator\nAndy Connecticut help looks for public private partnership following through on a directive\nFrom the state the law makers and you can't help is taking the next step\nIn searching for a potential partner to help bolster\nIts financial future now on Monday\nThe Farmington health system anchored by the two hundred and thirty four bad John Dempsey hospital\nReleased a solicitation of interest a letter hoping to attract suitors for a public private partnership\nFor its clinical enterprise\nAnd this looks like another uh Yukon story and we've got the best one of the world to tell the ear is Heather summers senator good morning good morning\nGood morning how are you this morning\nI'm doing just fine that I Know that you are referring to go\n[laughter] always right that's right well and my partner I I Want\nYou to meet a a pall I Know he's one of your uh one of your fans and are together we're going to talk about this and go ahead by\nYeah senator good morning or ... it ... this is this is interesting because again\nUm we have a scenario here where nobody is\nArguing I think against the quality of what new condos beat education wise or health care wise but it is is not a question of cost here and the long term future of Yukon and trying to find a partner here and balance out\nUh what the private sector can do versus what taxpayers and the and the general assembly can do here\nWell absolutely and I you know I and my focus in Connecticut as you know waste fraud and abuse between what happened at waiting for and that and I'm not afraid to ask the questions are typically in the area of government and healthcare\nSo when we talk about your kind how this is an implication that are the very end the million dollars and ...\nIn the area of government and healthcare so when we talked about Yukon house this is an institution that received ... millions and millions of dollars in tax payer money every year that your money that's our money\nAnd there was a report that was just found that you can help was found to be operating in serious deficiency as according to the state auditors report and some of those deficiencies that show with the University of Connecticut healthcare in Farmington they really were shocking um management for example lost track\nOf almost eight hundred pieces of equipment\nWorth more than five thousand dollars each now how to you know\nHow do you measure the hobbies how how do you do it how do you do that you have to ... you don't have a you have to kind of try and be that in a fish and you know what I mean\n[noise] well yeah I mean that's close to four million dollars missing it's just gone on accounted for no one knows where it is that shocking and unacceptable again this is taxpayer dollars here\nAnd you know we're in a state with a ballooning billion dollar deficit so every\nPenny I say is important let alone every million you know it's a huge deal and you know that's not all that stuff in disarray ah with the operation of the medical and dental school the research center and and actually the hospital complex you know\nAnother example that was out not too long ago was\nA professor they kept paying a professor there for more than six months\nWhen he actually he was he had died and he was in his house with him he was murdered\nBy like ...\nAnd so one of the questions we had in the hearing was you know how does that happen to the professor not show up for work and no one notices you know it's he he was on a special kind of research\nA position but do you have to send in materials you know that again I if you think about that and you know the corporate structure I Know it's not the same even in a a private college text or some would have to check in before ...\nShe'll you punish looking for a partnership here can you just to know what what the partnership would entail and how that would kind of benefits the taxpayer and the institution as a whole college going to be involved\nAbsolutely so one of the things that we had talked about with myself and lend a our leader senator says on oh was that really this is sort of an unsustainable pat ... we need to make sure\nThat Yukon is viable and one of the things that the way that we could do that is we have sent a directive from the state legislature that you can't health needs to take the next step\nIn developing a partner to help them the um themselves and their financial future they've experienced and not operating loss of almost a hundred and fifty million dollars this year the hot sustainable\nHow um you know something you know they're not\nThat we needed yes\nYou know something Heather would I don't understand and I'm sure a lot of people listening don't understand is here is the university\nThey got everything they need we have made sure that that has become successful for them\nBut it's just like the attitude I mean we got ... ... dollars you know we we just go to go do it and I think that is one of our problems\nWell you kind of the losing money since uh we're running an annual losses since two thousand uh fourteen and the financial model they have there is a money loser it faces serious challenges that that again this is taxpayer money that is you know a hundred and fifty million dollars in a law\nYou know if you were a non profit hospital you would not exist any longer you know you just can't continue at that level so one of the things that they have there which is unusual is um [noise]\nAs a public institution they have a large share they have actually unionized physicians and staff and that makes their overhead extremely non competitive when you try to compare it to the um the outside world so the pension liabilities\nUm for more than it's got about twenty three hundred employees it increased um\n... almost doubled from one point two billion dollars and two thousand six teen to two points three billion\nDollars will badges showing again again we see a hazardous leaking if you're willing to one another aspect of state finances and you know I I Know the state employee unions grumbling grousing crying moment has brought up\nBut again it's it's a state employee cost and pension liabilities ... than are wearing the ugly head again\nWell and this is unusual because I never I mean I Know a lot of citizen I have never come across a year\nYeah well and this is unusual because I never I mean I Know a lot of citizens I have never come across a unionized ... very different um that's something that is not typical in any way shape or form and if you look at it that is one of the biggest uh the biggest\nPortions of the the liability is they are the kind of help because of the nation that also makes me fearful when they go out for a private public partnership with I think is necessary for the sustainability of Yukon or we have to think of something else\nAs far as health care center\nIs it going to be viable because if you are another hospital that it's you know you don't have unionized that's right\nI don't know whether the overhead it's going to be something that they can absorb into the system to make it work will have to wait and see how that works but\nThe silver sneakers there's so many added benefit and you really have to look at your particular situation the most interesting thing\nWhat might be best for one person could be the worst choice on board is yeah yeah so we were always is always is always is so interesting and they get a there's a lot of misinformation out\nThere and it also has to do with I ... you write cost age\nI Would imagine correct me if I'm wrong if it has to do with if they still have some income coming in from ... from it of whether they're still working part time or investments or whatever\nSure um there's a program Brad last year we brought up you know the Medicare savings program in a big way with the state was going to reduce benefits and they did not thank goodness they did not and it's been a godsend for individuals\nAnd a lot of individuals don't understand how the Medicare savings program that works and it's a state program where you can literally get rid of your part B premium you can literally get rid of all your co pays if you're eligible not all your income comes for that so we help them sort through all that information all that mess they're inundated with\nMailers ... they you know we go into some individuals homes are stacks and stacks of pieces so we sort through all of that foreign\nAnd again for you folks who are listening let me just assure you okay that that this is a this is the best you could get\nI'm telling you right now or al and his family just tremendous and he's got a tremendous organization American senior benefits and what is the number that you want them to use to call you and also\nUh they'll gonna get a a learning the basics of of Medicare yes as the number that you want them to use second\nCall into eight six oh six seven six zero too sick so\nAnd um they can call in a request a consultation that come across the booklet we will go to their homes we will meet them in our office we have two officers we have an office in ... and we have an office in Farmington so whatever's more convenient we have forty representatives that are there to serve and they got to ... to go anywhere in the state of Connecticut\nUm just to make it easier for the individual whatever works people feel more comfortable coming into an office setting great whatever they whatever they have a need for\nAny number again it's\nEight six oh six seven six zero two six zero\nZero to and this\nAnd this being the benefits election period again people need to be reminded like I Am at a couple of my jobs where I had benefits this is the window where you have to decide what you want because if you missed this you're stuck for another year\nUm sometimes you're stuck sometimes you're depending on the situation to know ya but it's it is so important that you're not overpaying yeah\nSo many individuals and we made our overpaying because they just don't understand the rights and options under Medicare and that's where we come in that's where we're going to come in and we're going to educate them and we're going to be there for them based

I'm Sorry about that of course\nI Would go in this campaign and the word that's been camping out with them and know a day of the week it is but look at the bottom line is that you know pay is the ... goal\nHas been in politics thirty six years about going to go I've been alive she's been to Washington for ... years it's become a party line liberal I mean whether it's immigration were offering the open borders bill with diet but died\nOr whether it's the judges you voted no on just Kavanaugh would go for the terrible mirror that her party carried out you go to do and ... that you all for the green court\nJustices that or a McCaskill isn't just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri what the people will just be voted for and that's why we're going to record\nSo right now uh this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan of does not now that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture it in my view\nI Want to have people of Missouri thinking about like a crush like this on the border I mean it's a it's going to be a crush and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and for the national guard\nThey're not going to the people in the first really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the the I have I have\nTalk to you about it especially the last few days we just yesterday every stop on mood all over the the people ask me that the water's going on and off with the with the guns but we have a ...\nA few days and they just yesterday every stop I made all over the state people ask me they said what is going on and they what they say it thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who is willing to take steps to defend the country on like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness in this kind of threat to the country and now to have Claire McCaskill up based this threat\nOn during an open border bill I I just can't think of anything worse I Can't think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you I'm Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing in tennis highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than bronco Obama was or how important is the president\nIn this race for you\nKnow important you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to do what they want a strong America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for much they\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies are rebuilding the country and they're good for Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades of the state of Missouri job growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but if I went to the Nineteen eighties in\nThe state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas the airwaves grow but here's what scared folks that the Democrat Claire McCaskill want to take all by the way throw it all in reverse reverse of all the games and then go back to the policy week this overseas weakness on our border\nAnd uh you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\n[noise] Josh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that resonated at all at the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about\nA various issues\nThough I think what's been usually resident and you know the people to take to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape saying that she wants to take away Second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about how would you take those away from all five of her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's a centrally when our staff was caught thing over and over and over again it's it's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voters is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who was not ashamed of our way of life and the state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh I'm when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated\nOr by some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and and now in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly had socks and other networks\nIs that on people's minds the president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down and government work for them\nKnow I think that's absolutely true in Missouri I've you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill is offering its chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is not\nThe United states of America this was not\nCivil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech\nAnd harassed intimidate and even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it as Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... tactics employed that is not what the people in my state posts\nClear McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed that is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of um conservative\nReligious voters have is the social\nTransformation of the country the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many and say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nThat you know the Missourians leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to purchase two individuals you know this is something going on but the most of my career I've only been in politics years\nYou've been back on I Know you do a lot of girls out there [laughter]\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer and as a religious liberty lawyer and the you know the people said they are a fair minded people\nOr the you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value face and we believe that the importance of value a family and community and those things go around the churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected\nAnd I think you have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile to people who have a so hostile to religious liberties just like a hostile through our Second Amendment rights just like become off all the free speech I mean think about it what what the left wing agenda really offers as\nA you know you agree with us or you shut up into that is just not with the people of ice they want people to this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you of many many reasons obviously substantive reasons menu of the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times\nIs already writing ridiculous articles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts in in a and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had

pretty much everybody I Know his office\nYou know we are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time from the liberal state and\nI Do I wear a badge of honor I mean you know and I

out there [noise] suitcase nuclear weapons radioactive um dirty bombs or\nI mean I guess we can just take a flyer and risk it to say well we hope everybody who comes into the country is going to be economically self sufficient bringing no uh you know bringing no problems with diseases not be a burden that on our schools our health care I guess we could just\nHope for the best\nSee that's what the Democrats want they want to hope for the best that's why they're all for the most part they are either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it they know this is a radioactive issue for them they know speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should\nForce Democrats to ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released\nAmerica including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do who do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foot hold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when when is winning the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan in part to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part\nBecause in the process of stopping we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed and frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly challenged ... not to not not comprehensive reform Bush take the ten most things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our board half\nAs usual Newt Gingrich is one hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time can't do it so what do do they mean when they say they're for border enforcement\nDo they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime and their home countries should be able to come here\nOr anyone that just wants a better life should be able to come here no matter what\nThat's what the standards going to be so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built a with massive changes demographic changes to our country we better be ready all that entails\nI don't think America wants any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by of people who are informed about our history in our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to get a to get a better job\nThat's just an economic migrant we can't we cannot keep our country unified as a it just as a people as a country period if that's all it becomes a place to make money [noise]\nDo you agree eight five five forty Laura is this one of the important issues on your mind don't go away\n[noise]\n\n\nSenator Paul there needs to be significant changes made to our asylum ...\nBob or a care about it it has to be stopped\nA Senator Paul there needs to be significant changes made to our asylum process or to the entire system of or immigration admission into the United states given what we're saying we had a thirty eight percent increase in family units crossing the border month to month\nUh in in August or September I'm asking me thirty percent year over year and it was among the highest crossing right we had since two thousand fourteen disaster\nBecause people now if they bring a child then there'll be release or because you can't keep you can't keep them longer than twenty days so there'll be released together and then they never show up so it is the Senate and now it's finally going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who enter the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rules\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare and on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ... and this is something that should change I'm fine with ... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nUm we're talking to Rand Paul here on the lower income shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are our math and plus it's for the Republicans in in a tough mid term cycle cycle normally\nSo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming it often obscured by the media you know he often being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements said\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows the main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant managers as\nThey say we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time of foreign foreign but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because\nThis is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Steyer and sorrows and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this ...\nWho was living in the United states he was ... or was he he was previously kind of a sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and\nGot to radicalize spent media have been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars show the by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that or not good for America there's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the drop is around the world that teach hatred of Christianity Judy\nAmerica there's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand madrassas in Pakistan supported by them the Hakani network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to them the draw so funded by Saudi Arabians\nSaudi Arabians fund madrassas in Indonesia as it used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation but there there's a growing faction of those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind eye and say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis I'm not so sure that the Saudis are lesser evil than the uranium to tell you the truth\nThe war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia\nBut Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria\nTo al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this\nBut what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours though in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assist in American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ... Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and therefore McGuire hobbies and that is being sent an export around the world so uh as far as arms\nThey buy some of our I'm sure but I don't think the arms are military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nOur arms or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer the F. sixteen is not something that\nIf we can get jobs by selling F. sixteen to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it was about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts it I said at greater risk\nIt increases the risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that\nChaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nOr ... the Saudi foreign minister responded to your view on the show gave them and he said that\nI find it very surprising that some of these thousand miles away and be with us in advance of miles away no access information or intelligence services and tried to call them the senator of all this is not in taxes since the since the some of the nation\nOr take a swing at that\nI'm not too excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial so\nHe says oh we should presumed the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven\nOr like a three thousand people in your country that you have locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too so I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards a presumption of innocence and say oh we need to presume the crown prince to be innocent it's\nA dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince being involved the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist apparently many of them are henchmen there travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired\nShe chop ups or did the chopping up in the December him and other journalists and you get fired\nMy guess is they're uh they're banished meant will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talked to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and as so now I'm not too excited to be lectured by these people\nAre Rand Paul here on the ...

D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nAt the front of the group uh that were already in place in a makeshift area where they were receiving some a Red Cross or help and a publicity and thrown data was also there it's a nicer here to say that but they the group's very well connected with what's happening on the ground here\nAnd what I did have an opportunity to do with with meat and speak with all the people that were coming through mostly young men are a lot of MS thirteenth I saw as well as just a village or farmers\nAre able bodied working men who joined it this group in Honduras as it made its way through and what I can tell you is that\nAbsolutely the information that I was getting on the ground up based on what they were carrying their backpacks\nAnd everything seems very well coordinated they had a coordinated message a very very\nVery few of them veered off that message because there was leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I Do because you know you will catch people in the line okay move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward chat this say that\nAnd I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but demand up ahead is actually telling you guys what do you know so I'm assuming he's their leader oh no no no no we don't have any leaders we don't have any leaders I go up to talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward I said well you guys have matching backpack\nYou have you know the flag of Honduras at the front of your ah group nobody in the group actually looked that tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some bussing\nA that people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or is that a British abuse or that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so\nVery well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras uh remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between the various a conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here has been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a\nElections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\n[noise] one thing that I I find to be very disturbing or the or are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks\nOf these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that\nUm these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to\nCoach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan or they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out on their way or if something is done to stop this there will be well they're not a Sarah a group of thousands every week\nComing into our into our borders ...\nAbs yeah ... absolutely Lori this is not stopping I mean when I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nUh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part in these caravans the big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media\nAre in danger are in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what a mall and officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to to try to gather information to find out what's going on here\nWho is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a the baby was buried apparently asked by some of the leadership within the group to take the baby away and bury the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOf one of the reasons uh the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child life with so that they could charge people\nThat were coordinating this group with either manslaughter or murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward and for the United states and our us southern border this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nAre not just regular farm workers are people for villages are that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used by these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gang members there's some pretty bad guys in these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use by these organizers by these government\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with the coordination and they're presenting a huge problem uh not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people are\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah rolling\nThere's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just all of Eric ... going to let us into a their country and they coached them my coach them on credible fear\nCredible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you stay in America\nOh and it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you're released to the piece of paper\nAnd a judge says Ryan hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep the longer the twenty days and then they're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional status they get\n... feel like a debt of gratitude to the left and be defined do Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that his ear retrieval for Republicans in irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nYet a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of those reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegal to have voted right uh and and there was a shift and there's a shift in if they become citizens of course there's another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a\nUh somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is is that\nFor example men will take young girls you know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother so that they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still ongoing oh we have men who have little girls they know they can't\nEr into court date so we're seeing the catch and release it still on going oh we have men who have little girls they know they can't put\nThem in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they kept separate them so they released them so we're still seeing the same problem that we've seen for years\nHappening right now and the president you know President Trump is it very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too\nSo I think the most important thing we can do\nFor the United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hunter and government that is working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their of their country a political an apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any us money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating the separate than we really need or the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people there as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh\nFrom what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying we're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID a groups that are that are actually assisting and that's a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along the track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of a brand new is caravan this walk be put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nI'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose doing this and what's going on\nNow well again ... follow the money\nSo I didn't offer in California passenger module who travel

I'm so excited\nI'm honored to speak with you how can I help\n[noise] well I Am wondering my husband and I have five children together ah he has three children from a previous marriage and I have two children from a previous marriage and we are currently on baby step number two\nWhen we just have a few thousand dollars left to go before we're able to get our debt goodbye mhm and so we are planning on a\nYou know helping our children are calling as much as we can ... and ... five of them we realize that could be a significant than [noise]\nAnd all five children currently have five twenty nine plans that had been funded by cash gifts and things they received from their grandparents over the years good\nUm so his boys are are significantly further and math and my girls are my girls are quite a bit younger um but we just kind of want maybe around about\nEstimate on what we should\nPlan for each child or how to help each child through college because I feel like\nIt could be such an enormous amount of money with five of them but we also want to help them out as much as we can so\nThere's a couple of ways you can calculate it um as far as your target them out and if you know your target amounts you're was to ask for that then you can back into how much you need to be doing\n... the ones that got a little bit of a head start 'em they may be a little bit older are so it might come out fairly even I don't know spends on how much of a head start there is and it also depends on where you're thinking about going to school so\nIf I were in your shoes it doesn't sound like what's your household income\nYou're thinking about going to school so if I were in your shoes it doesn't sound like what's your household income [noise] we get 'em a little over a hundred thousand

speaking with you sir you too how can I help um yes we currently have a Nineteen year old with a family friend my best friend living with us he makes about declares Eighteen hundred a month\nAnd he has a car payment to twenty two cell phone which is about eighty bucks and for gas about a hundred bucks we budget for the ... um [noise] we're just trying to figure out what got him on an envelope says confesses she's lived with us real fast is his wallet was basically his bank account he had no bank account yet\nI'm what I'm wanting to know is how do we go along and do the envelope system with budgeting has money and putting money away and trying to help and figure out what to do with all his excess\nOkay well I think you teach him out to a budget and that's for every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it's always sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing the stuff that we talk about for a while and now we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up in emergency savings and begin long term investing\nOkay we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that ah it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the big thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm In the world to suggest we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years in what other steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOr how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just just take the income and give every dollar a name right down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some level of set up for like on a merger should find in the car like a car like emergency foreigners are you ... your car stuff you have things we do have famous quantum about ten percent of his ... home we put in your savings Warren\nOkay well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean on southern thousand dollars aside as my margins Avon and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I'd have a fully funded emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt in five ... five grand and savings wouldn't he\nYeah it'd be really well off so and and what and then I then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things and he was started talking about maybe some additional savings so he can have is ...\nOkay thank you very much hey thank you for calling it appreciate your joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I have a question about an inheritance [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have\nA significant amount of debt with the business and our personnel which has a lot to the business for ... years during the recession and five several years ago that we have a twenty nine thousand dollar and heritage that we [noise] um [noise] my husband had hope that we can\nEase for the kids' college have one daughter that than her freshman year of college now and then another one that will leave\n[noise] my husband had hope that we could ease for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and then another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and the baby thing and\nSo this business of making money it's struggling it makes many now but we still have um a good bit of debt from how much as ... profit\nUm profit [noise] uh\n[noise]\nGosh probably well I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past year but um\nAnd how long you're going to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job in there it's like that door closes and business door stays open and um [noise]\nHave business doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it and get a job because I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay our cells in the business and I'm Renee was bringing home I'm about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing your you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can we had a lot [laughter]\nHow much that if you go\nTo this guy fit about fifty two K. and we personally had about um Ninety six K ...\nWere you in the business doesn't have any that your son personally for it okay so that all is damaged ... dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a ...\nIt has banned that were made with an account to adjust something their side that we're taking distribution of all profit and\nThat doesn't change it right but that how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay a year so you need to find out what the profit if you don't know what can\nYou get back you can be three different answers [laughter] so you need to find out if it if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her those on here you got other problems\nRight now to ...\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what made\nOkay but I don't ... the only way that makes sense is\nIf you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the businesses making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts mhm or if you want to pay off if it's two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan the business is not on a plan and your personal lives on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got F ... in the mail today and when it started to do that on average ... [laughter]\nThat's a good start and and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going on and I quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that when you did fine tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nSo we need to fine tune our systems at the business the pit profit and loss statements the\nThe budgets that the business and so we knew exactly\nWhere every dollar at the businesses going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and one is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand other for the ...\nBetween these two different sets of debt and work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking\nYou to blindly throw it at the store to ... just filled it to that and I'm going to the debt and throwing a system that your business in the system in detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away and this went on thousands part of the solution to that\nBut the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money\nAnd as part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership this as the Ramsey show\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAs a planning the for each month happened and loves the every dollar happy that all the time who and so yeah I just sticking to budget and planning ahead and just delaying send the air and things that you'd want just waiting on them\nYeah and for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach\nA this debt free

today better than I deserve what's up uh we'll just wanted to give you all back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so uh you're feeling a little place but it kind of get used to everything but uh uh I'm currently unemployed\nSo are you feel on a place but it kind of getting used to everything but uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go in the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now\nI I'm an accountant and my life as a teacher she teaches special education on so she currently has a job um my question is we are living with her parents [noise] um for the time being until probably maybe next summer so until they can buy or on house\nUm we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us\nAnd we've got about that that much in our bank account right now I'm I wasn't sure obviously one type find a job if the best strategy would be to try to knock that get out as soon as possible and then from there started to stay for a house on with my life kind of want to do is just put everything we can toward a down payment to try to\nYou know hopefully not pay PM I get close to that twenty percent of course I didn't know\nWhat your take was in I mean it seems like we should still be able to have some sort of decent downpayment either way I just didn't know how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause he'll make your broker that's why they call a mortgage brokers home is not a blessing when you're broke its curse and when you have that and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks has always been and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not gonna like it so you might not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd save an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by and when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\n\nThe survey Ramsey show\nAre they going to the break I was talking to sharing the Sarasota, Florida and I'm sixty eight\nYears or Twenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which are the type of cash value policy\nA portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs and the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rage and so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investments\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion which is what I just said all correction\nYeah yeah okay and what his face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you earn your for one k.'s and you're now the only reason\nWe we do have retirement accounts they a total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar emergency find we our debt free or how to pay for good so [laughter] kind of like\nSo you don't have a lot of how much is on our cash value is in this\nUh right now that was okay and you have a pension plans as well yeah okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of four and my husband\nStill works his guy he um had thirty six thousand and income ... anybody than Twenty one thousand and Social Security\nOkay and that at all I I don't work gotcha and the face amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollar car\nAnd we did look into term insurance for him but number one it's really a lot more into his age but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically nobody will talk yeah very difficult very difficult when we don't know we we can lower or the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year if you haven't done much evidence having a month yeah OK\nLet's say eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise] um\nThirty six thousand dollars a year [noise] um\nWell here's here's the equation and here's the way it works in your mind okay the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay\nAnd so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not the only question is you know you you don't have a huge nest egg or you've you've got a small mistake and the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful\nMhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nAnd they would only last three or four years anyway and they sent me want to make it\nOkay and they're going to make you stop any way they are going to pull the plug oh yeah okay and at that point you cash it out and whatever cash value isn't there a\nBan and [laughter] I haven't been would like to get it out now\nYeah I don't want to get it out and all the way to get out now is closed policy down\nRight which are good at [laughter]\nWhich which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money it paid for house and be living on Social Security right\nYeah but you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um [noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are are are I'm Sorry Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they are going to shut the policy down regardless\n[noise] well I Know I guess if we can say hey you know if I find it would be over two hundred a month\nYeah I think we could have a guy okay right or we we could lower than that benefit and and keep it going and they found that we can do that which is what I wanted to do it when the hash it out [laughter] um I don't know that we're doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it um ah my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while\nMhm okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value and begin to pay the premium\n... and\n... you know it's going to do is going to use up some about a thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that and let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nMhm enclosure down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then I was his health\nHow am I I'm the first time I went to the same cancer free for five years and this time he's been cancer free for two years good oh I mean he he goes in and get a ... and every every six months I saw the matrix not coming back of a thank God for that\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open uh-huh if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going at that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open and if he if he's if the cancers come back at any stage right keep you keep the thing open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay so that makes sense to\nMe it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured oh\nYeah yeah but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments and start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I'm\nI'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be signing a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with cash now that makes it hard to discuss and hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years like the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy uh and still cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if he's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nSolved you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance will live life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just experienced it\nYou speak Spanish the back end what happens if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nYou just experienced it your six\nParents the back end what happened to see if you buy one of those pieces are corrupt policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into the into good investments that are getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there were three hundred grand plus the other four one K. I'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir houses paid for she wouldn't even called\nMe but instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her the insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked because if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself if you don't understand these numbers and you're still selling that stuff that makes you ignorant and you shouldn't be showing this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed ... way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist\nSo most people out there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist monkey Charlie show with Israelis and enthusiastic ignoramus that's a long ago Charlie we just nail him right there\nDoes he probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that sharing your if your friend if Sharon's brand sold her that\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you don't need enemies [noise]\nYou know good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this crappy bought\n[noise] whole live life insurance the payday lender or the middle class\nAggravates me this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nTwo boys what ages\nI'm lobbying ticks and Benjamin just turned three\nSo you've changed your family tree have injured\nI don't know anything other than they've been born into I've never having a credit card which is pretty dumb\nAs very awesome\nSo proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\n[laughter] actually talking about that a little bit earlier than that but my parents are very proud and you know to carrying it on you know some other people oh you got to poke fun a little ... and basically now and my friends or anything like that it's they don't they don't say anything\nAgainst nod yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house shut up yeah that's pretty interesting there and they will well done guys very well done what do you tell me the key to getting out of that is\n[noise] ... and staying on track\nYeah even when they went to screw up I mean I can be the want to be the most uh as all my idea but when I Want something\nOr I like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing and neither one of the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient the hardest thing\nNo well you did it for seven and a half years you lived like no one else now you can live in ...

retirement versus our house athlete currently owns about I'm Seventy eight dollars an hour is on our home\nGood and what your household income\nOr just under two hundred thousand a year for nominal

else who wants to play a game you can't do that you can play the game on me that is not diplomacy at all that's outright frightening\nFor president to say things like that when you're talking about the nuclear treaty with Russia being ripped up and by the way it was a treaty that was signed by Ronald Reagan\nSo\nWell I guess you could just put your ... your hat on and ... ...\nOr if you're a commentator like me who lives and dies by his word\nWhich is what I Do never make a mistake about it we live and die in this business by our word because there's something you're going to know you remember everything we say somewhere along the the line everything everyone and radio says is remembered by someone in the vast audience just listen to all of us\nAnd ah you people remembered things I said Twenty years ago so I don't take back anything I just said this is not diplomacy can be screaming from a helicopter where you can't even hear half the words you've got things slipping and no one's discussing it to me if you want to rip up a treaty that was signed by president what'd\nYou do is you convene Congress and you talk about the treaty\nAnd you'll give evidence that Russia has violated the agreement where where's the evidence have you seen any evidence that Russia has violated the agreement can anyone tell me where is the truth I'm I'm open I'm open to to to reason show me the proof Russia has violated disagreements\nAnd a justification for an ... between the nation's show me where that is\nThis is the opposite of the Trump that I voted for just the opposite of Trump who appeared on the show there's the opposite of Trump was non interventionist and a man of peace something's going on inside that administration that's very worrisome and I will say this we heard about an argument or a fight between\nThe great General Kelly\nAnd who was the other one I don't even remember who was it over the last time there was a screaming match between them and one of the other oh the the moustache and then we hear that there was a fight between Kelly and Corey Corey Lewandowski\nOver something\nSomething's wrong inside the picture because General Kelly is a four star

so he wants to rebuild our nuclear arsenal so in order to do so yes the threatened war with Russia [noise] watch\nLess I certainly ... plus Russia was trying to do is try to at least equal with them or maybe have a slight advantage\nOr is there any evidence that we outsiders can see which show that Russia has violated that Reagan Era agreement I don't know where that might be [noise]\nThat I don't hold on the line I'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria so we might stop mass hysteria joy those Savage Nation coal no ... [noise] and for\nI don't believe I'm In the inner circle at all I think I'm On the outs right now because I don't believe this administration likes any criticism at all and I think that if I stepped out of line here I did so for the sake of the nation not for the sake of the party or the sake of the presidency I care about the nation I put the nation above men do you know that\nI mean why we have\nA ... I see what you're saying but you're thinking that I should go you think I should be a little lighter during this period\nOf time okay you know what you make a very good point and I suppose my family would say the same thing\nBut they know they can't control me anyway so but I'm going to send you a stop mass hysteria for being so intelligent now before we we move on got again if I had a park is I go for an hour right now\nI started something earlier in the show and I talked about the army's invaders that are sitting on the border all these strapping young men and then I reference\nWhen the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west and I talked about why that happened in the third century and the reason they were able to break the Roman empire and the third century is because the Roman empire at that time\nHad been decaying socially and disintegrating Marley and then the barbarians of ... appeared on that borders now what's shocking and what I just said to you\nIs that no one listening to the show could disagree with me that this nation is not decaying socially and that's not disintegrated morally or you got to do is look is look at the people in the media and you'll understand what I'm Talking about all you got to do is walk in San Francisco and New York where you see a man urinating on a subway track\nOr a bum dropping his pants and deprecating on a street that's what I mean by decaying socially then add to that the drug epidemic in the nation\nAnd then add to that the the moral disintegration of the nation and you'll understand why were collapsing as a nation\nAnd so who saved the Roman empire almost saved the Roman empire\nAnd that was Constantine the great he was a monarch of great devotion and great intelligence by the way\nIn in some ways I Know you're not going to like to hear this Trump is like our Constantine the great\nI've made comparisons of Trump to pass to start figures and they've fallen on deaf ears because the ... the literary folk in the media don't want to hear anything good about Trump\nBut I'm sure they're educated people out there understand what I'm saying when I say ... he was constantly in the great ... of great intelligence who did some great things\nAnd what happened was ... Constantine originally beat back a raid of the gods the gods you know about God's will you know I mean the gods with black makeup and San Francisco they beat Baca right of the gods\nWho are trying to come in the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind him to protect the frontier across the down you why he was too busy\nHe was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a week in the empire from within and invasion from without you following this\nIs a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into but I'll summarize it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch\nBecause what happened was\nConstantine did the best they could but then he died trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome were ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at address on our poll\nVisit God's invaded almost the Constantinople they defeated the emperor of el ends at address in our poll they built the settlement in Bulgaria\nAnd from eighty seven three seven nine to three Ninety five there came the emperor you do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable and ... and ...\nAnd over the armies of Italy and ... presided still like you know he was a van dull and he presided over the armies and the Balkan Peninsula lark a guy and I could go on and on\nAnd I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to board your history as the bombing as a kid but the more I study these things I realize that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways which is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay\nAs was ancient Rome at a nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white and every color imaginable on our borders living pressed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after ... marched into Italy and after a short speech took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after um collapse did life go on for the average Roman listen carefully\nThe opening half of the fifth century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire in Europe become prey to Robert armies of barbarians does that sound like gangs listen to what I just said this is that an eerie as outrageous some history\nAs the Roman emperor empire in Europe collapses in the fifth century robber armies of barbarians were praying on the Romans citizen think about that\nThink about what you're seeing in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we lock our cars we have alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around the suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realized that at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives someone could break and\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the equivalent of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds rather hysterical but it is and it's out of the ... is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and look at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media by those in the fake\nNews business so I can tell you what went on in the life of the countryside half the room was invaded and what happened to the nation their roads and forest became infested with robbers the barbarians went into the forests or stop right there you're in California the barbarians\nHave almost destroyed our entire ecosystem the barbarians who've been raising marijuana in the ... national forest this press thing beautiful ancient fires have almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we haven't digital ... criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me is all these green left this who care so much about the environment\nHave said nothing as are sacred and pristine streams and waterways have been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers in our very national forests not one word from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man who spends all his time conniving to hate Trump\nConniving to bring in more illegal aliens says nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems it on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself history is repeating itself\nAs

nine the nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get on the program\nThat's how you do it on the latest on this um Saudi mess and again the president and I offered the president advice yesterday because by my account\nSince Friday we've we've had all these different accounts you know the president on friday we there was a news reporting in an audio by that he thought that the Saudi excuse was someone credible than that shifted over the weekend a you know now\nYou know the latest from the president is that the President Trump is not satisfied with the explanation of the show ... killing so that's the latest now\nFrom President front and he had three different takes on this and I just offer an officer just yesterday that the president just likes to say that just talking yet\nAnd a lot of times it it gets him into trouble because\nHe changes his story I don't know if he remembers what he said one moment for the next it just it would serve our president better if he were just in a manner like this just don't say anything\nSpecific just say oh we're very alarmed by this are we going to wait until there's a full investigation and we have all the facts and details instead of speculating and originally saying oh you know I find that plausible and they don't\nAnd he took a lot of course the criticism for that on both sides of the aisle\nAnd it's a necessary but again we've got the president can help themselves on ah the\nOn the ... the the the ... city a situation fifty can't can't stop himself but\nHe needs to sell the latest from our early gun today medicine is kind of left out on a disappointment because you know yesterday were being teased about this big reveal that are that he was going to deliver the the naked truth about the show he's death and you know ... ...\nIt would've been teased about this big reveal that are that he was going to deliver the the naked truth about to show these death\nAnd you know surprisingly especially too I Would imagine the really really really nervous a hunkering as right the royals have a pucker factor to folks um they had to be nervous about one or the guy was going to reveal\nUh so yeah they they were uh they were a little shaky I'm sure data in Riyadh on what was going to come out here but Oregon was very deferential\nToward the kings are never mentioned the crown prince of all\nA in the address to the Turkish Parliament he did say that the murder was quote savagely plan\nAnd it was carried out by the Saudis I he said I got some notes here from his speech from the translation he said the Saudis inside of the conflict turned off\nThe closed circuit TV feed hours before the show he was due to arrive which are as obviously further evidence that this whole damn thing was premeditated\nThey said that the Eighteen men identified by the Saudis on friday of the same Eighteen Saudis the Turks identified as being responsible and of course they know who they know came into the country and the passport scans and and the video from a passport control at the airport itself they know this\nSo that's about the the the Eighteen agreement on both sides and it's about the only thing I guess they're going to agree on here you know the Saudis still maintain that death was not intentional or to God didn't mention or any kind of a table recording of the murder as we've heard or didn't offer any physical evidence\nAnd he called on the Saudis to be more forthcoming to disclose where a cause show he's remains are and\nWho in Turkey is responsible or was responsible for the disposal of the remains you know the the Saudis have this ... me a excuse oh yeah they turn the body over to some local guy and they they don't know his name\nThey uh they lost his cell number they come I rarely and his new details on the body before we go to phones here in a moment\nOr some new details on the body or\nA or a guy on the the Turkish president wants or Saudi Arabia to turn all of the suspects over to Turkish authorities so they can be tried in Turkey\nI listen there's no doubt that the crown prince that NBS Mohammed bin ... he knew about this was totally signed off and I'm sure authorized by him but are they going to make these Eighteen ... folks all guys will they take the fall for the kingdom and not throw a a prince ... under the bus\nThat's gonna remains to be seen whether they got to turn them over I I I doubt they got to turn him over the Turkish authorities but you know we'll see you know he summed it all off by saying that it was a political murder that was planted by the Saudis days and weeks ahead of the actual events and it was a\nLittle more than ... than in the past couple of weeks but ah was measured enough that the uh the Saudi royals were surprised the Saudi royals apparently thought that he was getting a whole lot further\nWith us some of the details they've uncovered so I ... the Saudis we're like whoa whoa alright are not as bad as we find here as far as what are the guys said so earning on speech this uh you know came as the Saudi investments summit\nKicked off a as well as another conference which I was focusing on counter terrorism\nOr you know Steve Mnuchin our treasury secretary he didn't pull out of the the Davos like cement bought\nUm he is a scene and video I he he did it tends to counter terrorism a conference and there's video of him sitting next to the crown prince which I don't think the optics there I'd\nI don't think those look very well and then in a in a kind of an odd twist here one a card or one of 'em opposite ...\n... ... anybody on sort of the car dashing comes over to uh the the a team members Saudi hits I kidding joke joke a and one of the show he sons that with the crown prince\nAnd is even photograph the shaking\nHands very strange and they're about to ah write him a big big checked a\nQuite possibly and then before and grab some calls here\nI\nIs a a report from sky news sky news

is going to demand prove the reporters are going to\nAsk the White House press secretary what can you please I again is the information from customs and border protection tell us about ISIS has been intercepted and tell us about middle Easterners so the media is going to glom onto this and I don't know if the president has the goods or the proof there's\nNo proof of anything there's no proof of anything [laughter] like they could very well be if you look at what that was building you know they were talking about five or six thousand people I'm pretty good at estimating crowd size as you've probably a figure to tend to get a little bit off the real number last night as an example [noise]\nI was record setting stuff was that but they don't want to talk about that but I Will tell you let

yeah knowing he couldn't be heard and then looking to see if the camera was rolling to catch him I was I had him has on numerous occasions tried to inject himself and to make himself part of the

out and try to behave badly you're like in on civil a gathering and you know shouting down reporters and chanting CNN sucks I'm Sorry it doesn't reflect well on those that go to these rallies\nAnd it gives those that are opposed to Trump it gives the you know those that are are opposed to a conservatives and conservative media it just gives those individuals ammunition\nAnd I don't want to be

here and I've got a number of reports here\nThat a billionaire agitator activists George Soros at his mailbox [noise]\nA a relatively small explosive device was found yesterday afternoon according to law enforcement\nUh the device was detonated so proactively and was detonated by the bomb squad or\nThe police technicians were from the west Chester county police department at this point in the investigation don't know who sent them yet or they're not revealing it or what the motive was I mean I guess would be that they don't like George Soros but I can\nThat kind of behavior\nAnd yet or what the motive was I mean my guess would be that they don't like George Soros but I can condone that kind of behavior\nThe New York times says quote Mr Soros is a favorite target of right wing groups he was not home\nSo the FBI is now taking over the investigation as they should as well as the Federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives or they're obviously joining the federal investigation\nOr\nLaw enforcement I'll just try to skim through this they responded to the scene is is that the the tone on New York is a small little hamlet in the upscale town of Bedford which is in northern west Chester county\nAnd the cops locally they got a call about three forty five pm yesterday by the explosive package listen to this an employee of the residents opened the package which revealed it would appear to be an explosive device\nThe employee place the passage in a wooded area and called the police holy Smith so\nLet's get this straight the employee open the package luckily the package didn't blow up like some kind of Unabomber deal and blow the guy's hands or or or woman or whoever was male female but you know blow their fingers their hands off blue there you know blow their face off\nBut then even after identify that it was a an explosive device or something of that sort they carried the package outside the\nTwo of them water area\n[laughter] like that at that
