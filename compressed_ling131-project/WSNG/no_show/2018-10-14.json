doctors come she lets the politicians they demand a you know hundreds of thousands of dollars in a [noise] a under the table payments but the free meal for a doctor well that'll do the trick they'll prescribe the medication accordingly\nOr you might say well okay you know what's the big deal you know doctors they gotta eat too but the cost is passed along to consumers and this comes with the cost of higher drug prices\nUm the estimate is that the costs of consumer welfare of this behavior totals\nOr a hundred and Ninety million dollars per year that's a lot a six foot subs a or free meals are

third of those sit down to recruit or take a first steps are immediately disqualified why is that it's because of their wage\nUh the major reason that future potential soldiers disqualify a thirty one percent\nOf them to qualify for this reason is obesity so they've actually prepared a report for the military it's called unhealthy and unprepared\nAnd it concludes sadly that America's rising numbers of overweight you are going to have real impacts on the military's ability to maintain effectiveness\nSo you know part of the problem is that are not many kids want to join the military uh and the pool is diminishing or only twenty nine percent of young Americans are have a high school diploma no criminal record and know chronic medical issues okay so that's\nRight there [laughter] it's not a big pool I'm just Seventeen percent would be qualified unavailable for active duty and just Thirteen percent would qualify be available in the cheapest satisfactory score the armed forces\nSeventeen percent would be qualified unavailable for active duty\nAnd just Thirteen percent would qualify be available and achieve a satisfactory score and the armed forces qualification test so uh in in twenty sixteen Thirteen percent of sixteen to twenty four year olds were interested in joining the military that's not very many\nAnd that number dropped to ... percent or twenty seven seem to just eleven percent\nSo you know combination of factors you less people wanting to join the military and the ones that do\nThey they can't pass the test in terms of\nUh they don't have a criminal record they have no chronic medical problems there not obese are and they're physically able to withstand the rigors of military training and oh by the way uh those that do qualify\nA active duty soldiers who are obese were thirty three percent more likely to suffer most couples skeletal injury and that translates to more than three and a half million injuries that occurred among active duty service members two thousand eight in two thousand Seventeen\n[noise] um\nDo you know what was the leading cause of medical evacuations during deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan or would you say with ID's sniper bullets\nNow it turns out the muscular skeletal injuries and stress fractures were the leading cause of medical evacuations during the ... so in other words what took out more soldiers during these combat missions was not enemy fire\nA or\nRoadside bombs but in fact self inflicted injuries that occurred because people couldn't withstand the rigors of\nRunning around through the hills and mountains\nOf these countries are as a twenty fifty seven percent of active duty service members were considered overweight that's up Seventy three percent from two thousand eleven\nThe defense department spends a lot of statistics on thrown at you put this adds up to a very very unhappy picture\nDefense Department spends one and a half billion dollars a year and obesity related healthcare for active duty service members\nAnd veterans and their family members\nThat translates to six hundred fifty thousand days of work for active duty troops\nSo [noise] you know I'm this obesity epidemic is a national security issue because we're just not going to find enough soldiers to defend our nation\nSo it becomes a priority not just in terms of reducing health care costs and ensuring a

emissions known\nEnvironmental impact and no sound on these boats are going to be able to take a lot of farmers and open up their regional markets by introducing them to Connecticut markets\nAnd also introducing the Long Island guys over in Long Island Connecticut Connecticut into Long Island\nEach boat talk will have a retail facility farmers' market and butcher shop and cat day so that that local farmer can get right into that market and the retail spot and find out whether or not the area where we straightened it was really going to be profitable\nAnd how long before the this is an operation so we're first phone is being built right now and director shipyard and ... uh we're about forty five percent completely delivered a boat in March we had the one store and retail area nice

uh\nMechanism by which grows a shame to what your vision [noise]\nThere's about nine billion dollars of farm assets between Connecticut and New York\nMy family on our own local farms and when we lost our waterways the regional transportation system for that farm fell apart at the interstate highway system moves everything inland\nGetting that product down into the New York city Brooklyn and the Gulf Coast areas of Connecticut Long Island to those family farmers could move that product\nIt's really the farmers that are driving this thankful I'm just an old salad at wants to be able to help them out [noise]\nThat there are a sustainable minded people with the Jews to ah you know put some money muscle behind this idea [noise]\n'em one investor para heightened right who is that type of

about four hundred and sixty email addresses that far made a we're sponsor we made a ten thousand dollar donation to a bar made\nWilly and the boys on what they're trying to do here it's an easy pitch

city\nUm we're not only operate reservoir community farm we also support community gardens and school gardens almost thirty gardens across which for our children can grow food for their for their for their dinner tables and where teachers can utilize\nOutdoor gardens at a ... we also have a youth leadership program I was just kind of the heart and soul of our organization and that's the program

and end up putting some seeds and that are um\nAnd and being able to uh to reap the benefits of that and um we just on a you know as a as an Italian family we always has been a as a central part of our of our lifestyle and our family and I are getting together so that has always been incredibly important to me to be able to prove I work with food and\nMake sure that those that are participating in the food system in whatever way they want to um is is my passion so not only are we are educating providing opportunities for folks to grow their own food\nFor the tables were also running urban farmer training programs we're growing the gardeners can learn how to start growing for market worm looking for the the inability of our programming of of of agriculture overall in Bridgeport through developing an urban agriculture master plan with the labor which where\nWe get to work with farmers markets color in our education\nComing airing trainers I'm done or that can that kind of adopt within the system so that hopefully our growers can so you know they're ... lost to the\nFolks who are making it started because I Hope we are growers can sell their hot peppers up their growing and

a Mars fresh brew\nLike come on now you see that kids wanted so make sure that they will do them when they get salad is like nothing really little especially if you get the\nFood donated there's like a lot of places I Believe that would probably be willing to actually donate to just so that kids have access to it especially in the community but it has to be about\nThe board of education like all getting everyone on board and putting it back and look what is happening by everyone has to be a more to what the mission you can't have one person and then another person like now they're okay but if you look at a board it's not people from Bridgeport people\nFrom outside of the sudden so they don't understand the problem do beyond your\n... hall Alex's though are one wrap it up with the same

you know\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's

could do it right you could do it now if you wanted to 'cause\nI don't know many people other than our breasts who uh January in the middle of January going to be wanting to a kind of tree I I think I'd be I'd rather be sitting inside and a nice warm house but that that's just me\nThat that sounds good to meet you [laughter] so one of the things I Want you to take a look at what the plant is off for soccer gross is the first thing now sucker growth on a tree is a branch that basically comes from the main stem or even sometimes on branches\nAnd it either go straight up and down if it's from a branch like I'm Talking straight up and down almost perfectly straight up and down or if it's coming out from the trunk it'll go out about like a half an inch to an inch and then take a Ninety degree turn straight up and down as well those are called suckers\nSuckers will take away water from the plant take away the nutrients away from the plant\nThey are part of the tree so they are you know it's not like a um something that's just showing up on the tree this part of the tree but that's the way the the plant will grow\nBut taking these away will allow some of the well a lot of the plant to focus on other parts of the plant on the new growth on those areas that are going to flower for you that are going to give you the nights fruit for the crab apples that type of thing\n[noise] so have you first start with the soccer growth and get rid of it as much of that as possible\nLike I said do you usually see it on the on the trunk itself or but you might start to see some on some of the bigger branching like I said it'd be straight up and down from there you can cut back by the on the rest of the tree by a third the third is the general rule of thumb\nI'm so say and and I'm Talking just from the the growth that's from the trunk not not including the trunk itself so just that grows the green gross if you will a third of that\nStuff you can help them times if you take the trunk into effect you might take a third but it might be too much so ready to just take a look at where the green growing is and take a third from there okay [noise] okay now one other thing too like I mentioned was cross um branches that are rubbing on each other\nThose are those areas are more susceptible for diseases or to allow insects into those areas so branches are just sitting on each other rubbing or it could be a detrimental to the plant long term a seat tried to take a take a few of those out if you can\nAnd even the ones that you look at and you're like you know what maybe in about a year those who are going to Rob I Want to get rid of one of them don't get rid of both just get rid of one of 'em because he by taking both you could end up really making a hole in the tree uh okay so those are things you can do like I said you can do it now\nThe best time to really do it as um winter or early spring so you can see in that you know with the leaves not there you just have a better picture of where the the branches are\nSometimes I saw that with all the leaves I'm you know you reach into cut and you're like I Do I have the right branch and then all of a sudden you cut well if it's wrong branch you can't really put it back on you know what I mean so that's\nThat's why they say winter and spring or the best I even you know late fall when there's not many leaves that's what I like to do it makes life easier\nThe other one last thing is really when you're cutting that ... one at a time um unless it's that sucker growth is going to start cutting some branches and\nCut a step back take\nA look and see if you can shape it in the right way if you've got one and then cut another you could be going at a zigzag that type of thing that's why I like to see a step back after each\nRoom just to take a look at it [noise] so caring hopefully that helps you we appreciate the phone call and I enjoy the rest of your day thank you thank you for a number of years eight five five six six zero fourteen six one\nWould you like the guy to be green this year yes as possible with virus they products\nWell so what what you could do is I'd still do that um ... cleaning them out dipping them in water and letting them sit and water\nWe're going to turn off well so what what you could do is I'd still do that um ... cleaning them out dipping them in water and letting them sit and water for a few days\nYeah I don't want to make them work if you put them in water you gonna get fungus on them or they might sprouting up\nMost of the water allow a will get in there they might sprout and that's why you would want to do it in the house but if you're going to be doing it outside or you know you can just put the seeds and you know it's it's worth a shot I you have you on that and say you have a fifty fifty shot if it lives or if it dies\nUm so I can give you that percentage on it um\nBut I I you know if you're if you're trying to really get an established by doing that you could do it inside or outside really up to you and how you want to do it um but it is it is worth a shot in my opinion\nOkay from about the blues struck I'm a high dreams are\nSo the blue struck I ... you should have blooms every year but it really just depends on the winter\nThis past winter that we had really done some damage to tons of different high during just\nMean hedge ranges where you know that normally bloom on new would every year such as the endless summer high drains you yeah with having less blooms than normal\nHere has a you know the weather that we had so February or there was a day that it was about Seventy degrees I remember I went to work in shorts in February and I was like this is awesome\nFebruary and I'm In shorts problem with that is the next week we had a nor'easter but it wasn't a regular uh snowy nor'easter it was a rainy nor'easter\nThat rainy nor'easter\nWhat it did was it started saturating the ground kind of de thought a little bit so plants we're starting to say okay this is the weather we get in April so they were thinking that it was time to wake up for a couple of weeks\nThe next week we got hit with a couple of feet of snow in the week after that we've got a snowstorms week after that we got a snowstorm in the week after that we got a snowstorm [noise] so it really did some damage on the plants and that's why you're seeing some of the plants that normally do on a new would I'm not have as many flowers the blue struck should have a yearly\nAnd you should be fine but it really depends on the winter um\nFor like to see you do is in the spring late fall early spring with the blue struck that's when you can print them back a\nLittle bit or get rid of any of the the dead that's there if you really need to permanent if you don't need to prevent just leave it alone um you could also at this time right now and he's a blooms that are there are that are starting to go by just cut the blooms back\nSo that during the winter or the snow doesn't have something extra to sit on in ways of plant down by cutting those spent plumes right now you're not really pruning the plant you're not hurting the plant by doing this it's really just helping for winter\nI'm In one of the newsletters that my father put out in the past um I Believe it was one that we we share this week when he likes to see done with high drain just as you take them and create like they looked like a Hershey's kiss and tied to the the er at the top so it looks like that that stem on the top\nOdd for winter to help so that was a heavy snow load or anything along those lines that doesn't push down the center and and split it\nUm so those are some of the things you can do\nAnd then to help protect it even more um around Thanksgiving once the ground is really frozen hopefully at that point the ground is frozen and where we're moving on from there you know getting that winter\nYou can put a couple inches a couple of years that I mean like twelve inches by twelve inches around the base of the plant you can put some mulch pine needles a straw or salt marsh hey around it to help protect those areas um that should really help it with the with the high dream is to get a better winter for them\nOr to twelve inches all the bug generally a higher up there like four feet up so if you put the just twelve inches other ... work for the times I mean you know what I mean you might be scraping the bottom of the plane but the flowers on down there on the end for the GOP\nIs what you're actually doing by doing that by the base is your help protecting its root system\nThe root system there really needs to be protected to help produce more for you next year the blossoms that are up top I understand that it's you know not protecting the\nBoat you're really doing is helping the roots to protect the shoots because if down below where the ground freestyle cause that's where your first shoots are going to come out if those get affected and frost readings it's going to start to really deteriorate the plant\nThe other thing you can do and it's not common it's not written on like a will stop her will proof bottle but my father's always talked about this with the high dream is one of those the tips of them where the the um the bugs are for next year he's always talks about spraying the buds so that way it'll help\nWith the high dream this windows the tips of them where the the um the bugs are for next year he's always talks about spraying the buds so that way it'll help bring in some of the moisture into the plant can't hold it for winter to help protect it\nDoing a few of these things it really could help it for next year but Mother Nature has her own way of by taking care of the plant and ... and sometimes that's not in a a great way that we would like to see\n[noise] yeah but you know what this global warming I think these are big changes in weather like come on to cold cold or warm and all that stuff affects them greatly you know\nI mean my my I drink is growing like crazy to mark but there were very blooms I mean I I have already ripped out one I got this conflict with then I put I put a new one that the group through harsh winters you know after the winter and that's what I feel like doing as ripping them all out because\nI spent two or three years that I've got much more reduced going because the winters have been so crazy\nSo it it yeah the winters have been doing that one of the other things I'd like to see you do that can help promote I'm Better blossoms late winter early spring so we're talking April ...\nI Want you to use a super phosphate or a um has or like a heavy phosphate usually a super phosphates is zero forty four zero\nI'm there's also triple phosphate which I Believe is zero eight teams arrow it's kind of like a balloon booster what that does is it will feed the root system even more to help promote better flowers I'm that's why I say the super phosphate 'cause there are forty four zero is really a great stimulate her but you need to do it early\nIn the early I'm yeah I'm Talking like end of march early April once the ground really saws even start putting those into your flowering plants that didn't do as much flowering this past year ...\nAgain it's one of those things where the more you take care of the roots the better the shoots are for the plant and the better the flowers are\nThe root system we don't see and sometimes we forget about because we're really just looking at the plant itself and saying hey I Want you to bloom so much you to have this but at the root system is failing or is not strong enough by not given at some of these products\nIt if it's not going to be beneficial for you you know it's one of those things where when you plan to any of the high during just use some of the ... own starter a or use some of the ... from natural alternatives you can even\nDo the pro it allies are multiple times during the season almost every month or will help with the microbial um\nDevelopment the more the more you take care of those routes the better the plant really will be after that that's something you need to look at too [noise] um [noise] a number of those things are going to help it but again as you said global warming you never know what's going on mother nature's gonna mind of her own she'll do what she wants to [noise]\nSo

bone I'd a couple of other companies uh have it um [noise] there's a there's some\nThere's some really good products to use one of the things that I Want to reiterate is about the brain of it is make sure you don't spray when the fruit is actually on it [noise]\nNo I I I Know that at this point there's no fruit but when there is fruit earlier in the season just make sure you don't spray it if you're trying to kill it at that point or by doing that you could just uh\nThe the birds or any of the animals that got it could have some of that poison in there and I just just as the thought is just like don't don't a spray certain insecticides when flowers are blooming\nUm or when bees are active that type of thing I just like it would be a little bit safer out there to make sure we take care of a mother nature's a creatures um\n[noise] the other thing it just it's going to take you a few applications to do this um it's gonna be [noise]\nMaybe three to four times to really get this down there and it's going to be a couple of years I hate to say that but it it's just\nYou know you you said you did it a few years ago you cut back a you know a lot of it and and then the shoot started to come up well it's hitting those shoots again when they start to come up in ... killing the root system being a vine that does have some some route sort of go from plant to plant underground [noise]\nMy bike killing not to the root is going to be a lot better now like I said you can use the organics but there are ways to do it uh to to really sprayed with some some chemical products or the brush killer a again they have it um from multiple companies\nOut there you could use 'em to do that I I think organics would work\nWell I just think sometimes with something like that that you've done so much you might want to uh\nTo try something a little a little stronger and that's why you know do it towards the end of the day or so no beans or insects or anything like that are out there so you're not killing now I'm I'm with it\nThe guy you can try try some of those really to do that the other company out there is um formerly Bayer advanced um save a re purpose there their names um I think it's um bio advanced at this point uh but still\nThose products they have a brush killer that's really strong and really good uh to use on that you could also use 'em like up there is a poison ivy and find killer that you can use for multiple different companies a bona fide and um by advance have those those are those are great products are to be getting rid of it\nBut unfortunately it's just going to take a couple of times\nWhen I gave them up does that mean I'm just wasting my time because the route to probably like five inches down so that is saying that the connection between that one that I just dug up other one well\nYou know they didn't give him up digging them up is is one of the most organic ways to do it and it's going to take all that plant out um so it is beneficial\nUm but you just make sure you get as much of it as possible you know fairly old plants around it I'm just if it's just covering an area just try to take your your shovel\nOr after you've gotten the the main plant and kind of dig up some of the roots around it kind of stick the shrine put your foot in there and see if there's any anything like pulling back at you like a roommate and\nI didn't need that kind of see our eight maybe ... ...\nStick to shine put your foot in there and see if there's any anything like\nPulling back at you like a roommate and I didn't need that kind of see All right maybe I'm getting a few more roots in there but that's how they'll grow\nAnd that's why you'll see some more in the spring but that's when you want to do it again or cause they're weaker there just sprouts so you have a better shot but that organic spray\nThan when they're stronger more woody structured\nAnd I have another problem I have very end though I think that's one of the name of them

your local gardening\nSo it's it's it's a little bit of taking a look at that why would you ...\nAnd there is that ah\nThat'll help somebody has low release that would work\nOkay one the other way you could do is just grab the stem a little bit and pull up just a little bit I'm not talking like to rip it out pull up to see how the roots react do they hold in does it just it really moved just by barely touching it\nIf it really moved just by barely touching it then it's probably being over watered and it has some roots development issues\nWith that um you're keeping the inside you could almost use like a ten ten ten an all purpose fertilizer I they have them in liquid form that you could really give that\nTo the plant and give it a little bit something else the tent the middle number on there is going to help with Ruth development and I think that should help you with this\nUm it's just I think something else is going on I think it might be just too wet um consistently\nOkay [noise] well I thank you for that and all that happy note I'm the rest of the plant which is about six feet tall is doing much better now that a lot that often I noticed a small shoot coming up from the soil which is about eight inches or so it was very happy about\nAwesome that's a that's great news and you know going forward if you want to do it again um you know by cutting sometimes it doesn't always work at it can really stimulated but make sure you some uh\nRooting hormone um that you play in a bottom of the plant that gives it a great start sometimes it just has that transplant shock looks great at first and then just heads down south but you know I'm sure the way that you plant has been growing you might be able to cut it again in the next year or two to get ... to try it again\nOh super I appreciate the advice\nThanks joy joined the rest of your day thanks you too Bye bye and use the phone number here is\nEight five five six six zero four to six one again eight five

health plan saying earlier I heard how somebody try to put on the top of this fungus lot but I didn't catch the name of that product it's\nYeah it's a systemic house plant um grand Newell from bona

rules I Want to put those into the soil mix it in a and then I Believe you water it in\nA it definitely does help with that it gets a couple of different stages of the other thing that I suggest doing if it's still outside maybe spray it with them all seasons oil or some Nemo oil spray them plant itself just you're not bringing everything inside with you\nAgain on but doing those two things should really help it but it's a systemic house plant\nBrand new all that really ...\nInside with you again on Monday during those two things should really help it but it's just the stomach house plant grand

right when was the last one that I throw the trash out this type of thing but then you realize they're coming from the soil the plant and this is the best way to do it\nOne other question was um [noise] this year I had to read literally bug um and I\nWant to feed them the plant a tree and and plant the ranch rub can trap yes\nUm because they were flowering and we had tons of these around you have um I left all of the dead a stamp out there and was wondering if I could apply that now and it would it kill anything that might be in the ground\nSo I wouldn't do it now when I Would do is do it in the spring and right when the plant is starting to emerge from the ground okay so it's usually when the first couple of inches of started in that starts to protect\nAnd as the the plant grows this solution will trends locate through the plant as it gets bigger to help reduce the risk of that um [noise] the Asiana clearly beetle there yeah um\nAnd that won't hurt the bees when their flowering\nNo so it it will not because it's so early in the stage okay um I like to make sure that\nAnything that's flowering [noise] I don't spray at that time that's the best way to protect the bees um [noise] it should be you know I Can't say that it's not going to hurt the bees cars zero things out there that could hurt the bees I don't want to\nYou know say for a hundred percent certainty but I Know that in the early stages there's no flowers there's no buds and that's when the lowly leaf beetle is starting to emerge and starting to work its way into the plant before the flowers are there okay so that's going to help prevent them from coming in and killed them early ...\nMy father always talked about doing it it's not even written on the label\nThat um if I if I remember

actually having a constructive conversation and he said the other day at a rally he was talking about people who had been incarcerated who are now entering the workforce\nAnd you know what a benefit that is to society and there is something to be said for redemption which it is an ideal that we have given up on in this country in many ways\nI mean but when do we get people's second chance yet and
