that\nYou know we started out way back when and you know who knows where the industry was going to go and now it's are\nSo popular and mainstream\nIt is and uh you know regarding immunity you know people are suffering colds and flus I I'm myself them are getting over one right now\nAnd you know one of the problems is so many of us are unrestricted diets I've seen figures that somewhere between twenty and twenty five percent of the American population is on some kind of restricted diet whether it's paleo Quito or a vegetarian or\n... or kosher or a gluten free there's so many of these variations but whenever you're on a restricted diet\nYou're restricting your ability to get certain nutrients are the some of the classic ones are are vegetarians with vitamin D twelve or omega three fats or\nOr you have the people and the Quito diets you might not be getting all the nutrients they should or restricting carbs or or fats or things like that so ... uh with that in mind we're not necessarily getting all the nutrients we need to be fully functional and to be able to resist these challenges\nEspecially during seasonal changes in times when we're moving indoors and exposed to more people\nYou know so Neal you know that there's been a lot of blowback against supplementation lately in fact you know some a media reports that several multi vitamins are really you know we used was a kid can you respond to that a critique because you know many conventional doctors are now taking that attack\nYeah but that's that's really a myth that you can get all the nutrients you need from a healthy diet without Europe limitation because the food tables that were built by the U.S department of agriculture in Nineteen forty our way out of date they don't reflect the current food supply or the way that people are choosing their foods\nOr the way foods are process today and so they're kind of imaginary numbers that I mean imagine that we're getting everything we need from our diet if we eat an ideal diet with all the options that were choosing not to eat a lot of foods and the\nNeed for bridging those gaps there's nothing better than a supplement than a lot of the negative reports are saying that dietary supplements and multi vitamins especially do not prevent cancer or heart disease in short term studies\nThese are not short term developing issues and people don't take multi vitamins to prevent cancer and heart disease they take them to bridge nutritional gaps which is a logical sensible thing to do\nWhat what are some of the star and nutrients when it comes to a immune support and and I'm thinking particularly you know people who are uh you know maybe they have medical conditions maybe they're on medications were there\nThose two are immune support and and I'm thinking particularly you know people who are uh you know maybe they have medical conditions maybe they're on medications waiter interfere with nutrients but also you know older adults who will you know it's a big deal when somebody whose Seventy five gets a cold or flu it can really knock him back\nIt is and the first thing I Would always recommend is a multi vitamin because you get vitamin a he had vitamin D you had vitamin C. vitamin e they all have roles and immunity you have minerals like selenium and think that have roles in immunity so if you get the\nBasics then you know you're not deficient and the body has resources to have defenses against these illnesses we've known for over a hundred years for example that vitamin deficiency makes measles more aggressive\nAnd there's more recent research showing that viruses react to a lack of nutrients in the body and become more aggressive they can even mutate in that body and become more virulent so or the ability to resist depends largely on nutritional confidence\nThey need now taking an example of that might be selenium where they found in a part of China where he was they were selenium deficient that the C.

questions you know first of all let's clarify the difference between natural thyroid and synthetic spy read your taking the synthetic thyroid\nWhich is fine for many people are however I find that some people don't do as well on it as on the natural pirate so the natural pirate goes by gr in different names or use Roy ... armored thyroid\nA natural desiccated thyroid but you know it sounds like you're doing okay on the synthetic I read which is either generic ... or brand name since right so a little background on that\nIs that the makers of since Freud a undertook a study years ago to try and prove that their brand name since Freud\nWas superior to the generics because I Would offer that are obviously offer them a competitive advantage I mean their product is more expensive and why would you want to take something more expensive\nIf I'm there wasn't better so the study of basically demonstrated that they were equivalent that health Roxanne generic was equivalent to since Freud\nAnd there was kind of a scandal because they tried to bury the study and the author of the study or actually came out it was kind of a whistle blower they they told her up to the study was done okay you know that's very nice go home\nThank you were doing the study and they tried to suppress the results\nAre so ah however that being said some people do appear to notice the difference when they switch from center a gel throw rocks and often doctor say well you know we're gonna save somebody will put you on the generic\nPatients don't just feel the same it's different strokes for different folks ah the difference is in the delivery system\nThe amount of medication in a generic is always the same\nBut the tablet they may be different and for some people the way they\nThe medication in a generic is always the same\nBut the tablet they may be different and for some people the way they digester absorb the medication the medication may hit them all at once or it may be released in a slower fashion depending on the matrix in which the medications delivered that's what the differences between a brand in a generic\nAnd uh it makes a difference now they feel cause thyroid if released all at once can give you kind of a rocket ship trip and then drop your back down and wants to wears off and he wanted to be kind of gently time released into your system I think personally that it doesn't make that much of a difference when it comes to this particular product\nDifferent situation when you deal sometimes with psychiatric drugs some people say well I Do great with a lecture pro that is the brand name but there's you know the generic or doesn't do the same for me I was feel all together different that can make a difference\nAs I said different strokes for

we\nFirst of all the money we have people that have an awareness that fire can still happen they do happen every day\nAnd it's particularly important at home because home it's a place that people are

happening in the first place but if there is a fire make sure that you're prepared\nVery good when it comes to a preparation uh I Know that ah\nFolks who have been on our program before talking about fire safety um they continue to stress and I continue to be shocked at at households that's still a do not utilize or correctly utilized smoke alarms and fire extinguishers\nUm although one is probably much more important than the other uh in the grand scale of things those are pretty much the two components that really elevate your chance for surviving of fire of any size in your home right\nTo smoke alarms or your first line of defense and a fire because they alert you and time to skate faithfully and there's so critically important now because we know that\nA fire today burn faster than they used to for several reasons so when the smoke alarm found you may have as little as two to three minutes to skate faithfully have got to have the smoke alarm in the right places in your home and make sure they're in working order but then you have\nTo know how to use that time wisely and not take the advanced planning and practice\nSo really hold a skate planning a practice or really another critical factor\nAnd being prepared because you have to make sure that you and everything\nIn your home can snap interaction with the smoke alarm sound like you don't lose that precious time making missteps\nThat can really you know in minimize your ability to get out safely so those are that you think a key thing that we like to focus on fire extinguisher can be good at putting out ... fired\nThe gap to be able to have the right kind of extinguisher for the type of fire you're trying to fight you have to be trained in knowing how to use a fire extinguisher into a staff in a fire situation\nIf you have the right type of skill fat the right fire extinguisher making sure that as you put the fire out you'd be able to still get to the exit if you use a fiery English or incorrectly you can actually spread the fire and make it more so we really don't focus on extinguisher because again they can be really highly effective\nOr anything that is in disrepair it's time to get and get

museum for children and the sustainable living expo\n\n\n\nWill as we said in our introduction our final segment this morning we're going to go out to Colorado Springs on the phone and meet ed ... he is the senior VP of brand for junior achievement usa a junior achievement as an organization that we have a\nBeen a very close with here at least in regards to the work they're doing in Connecticut for most of my uh twenty eight plus years here on the program we check in with them often and this is the first time we've\nHad the opportunity to talk to someone uh at the national level of but it is quite important a new two thousand Eighteen research that was conducted on behalf of gender achievement and overseen by ed\nI'm a ... and the folks at Ernst and young ah illustrates how in just a year after first being surveyed high school aged teens career ambitions have shifted further away from careers in stem science technology engineering and math\nAnd the arts and how more Thirteen to Seventeen year old students are expecting to take out loans to help pay for college so I'm ed thanks for joining us on the program a tell us a little bit of a a about yourself\nAnd and why this was something that was particularly important that junior achievement\nOh thanks for having me John I'm yeah in terms of junior achievement test folks may have heard of our organization we reached a nearly five million young people a year which\nPrograms that really focus on financial literacy entrepreneurship and work readiness and so obviously when you think about work readiness and career readiness the whole um you know stem component is is critically important because you know as as most steady\nAnd and most folks will tell you in particular employers more and more jobs are going to require stems skills in the coming years so we really wanted again and understanding of wear\nJeans mindset is right now related to stem careers\nAnd and where does the\nOf the issue tied to taking out loans play a role does have something to do with the fact that I'm a lot of organizations that would employ these stem\nGraduates are are helping to to pay for college and the move away from interests in stem careers is going to push these students are into you know taking out loans to pursue other interests where they might enjoy some degree if not a\nA really comprehensive degree of of educational underwriting from future employers\n[laughter] well I mean and they're you know there may be a little bit of a disconnect regarding the the paying for college one thing that we did see in the survey is that even though I'm there is a decline especially among teen boys in terms of interest in stem careers there seems to be an understanding that some sort of technical proficiency your skill sets can be required whether or not they end up in the stem field and\nPerson stem careers there seems to be\nAn understanding that some sort of technical proficiency your skill sets can be required whether or not they end up in a stem field and so for the perception of teens are probably looking that that college is definitely going to be a requirement that you know as we know and and that's even applies to stand that's not always the case you can actually\nLook at the turn of pathways like going to a two year community college or you know I mean some kind of a career and technical training and so a lot of that\nMay just be a ... misperception on their part in terms of how they would need to um pay for higher education\nI see and then the um the component of a careers in the arts um was also a piece of this study\n[laughter] yeah so in terms of the arts pizza you know when you talk about stem there's also a\nGrowing emphasis on what they call scheme where they include arts is part of the stem component and really what's happening is you're seeing more and more of a merger now of of the arts ended a scenario because design design thinking in a design approach are really in you know integral to you know the stem space so if you're looking at engineering chances are you're going to be working on a cat\nFrom sort of computer assisted design element to design thinking is really becoming a very basic a component of what's happening I'm In stamp computer sciences at the same way if you're going to be a program or you're going to need kind of that you may\nYou know benefits from that creative artistic type approach when you think about how you're going to develop something so there is more of a connection now with art and standards so that that again is is a bit disappointing that we're seeing teens you know kind of moving away from that arts space as well\nAnd so when we're looking at this uh the kind of ... three headed set of data the a drop in the interest of boys in stem careers of the level of essentially the ... the flat a status in regards to girls\nAre and then a careers in the arts and concerns about teens expect me to take out more student loans\nUm you know how do those three uh you know come together and make somebody like you are interested in going out and and surveying and actually painting down um you know a little bit more\nTightly uh the statistics that the the study ended up revealing\nYeah well so you know as a nation right now we have about I think one point three trillion dollars in\nOutstanding student loan debt and at the same time employers are saying that they're not getting the folks they need with the skills that they need to do the job [noise] um they need today and into the future and so obviously there is a disconnect we have so many young people going out there going to college I'm\nSpending money on um degreed but at the same time employers are saying ... this is great but what you're learning isn't necessarily aligning with what we need from unemployment standpoint so that's why it's critically important to get a teen's thinking in terms of what are some of those opportunities that are out there um such as as\nCrews and the stem space because that's really where the future of of work is going and so it's really important that if you're going to take on\nThe investment of of higher ed that in the end you're going to be able to find a way to help pay that back\nAge six nine blue hills avenue in Bloomfield our theme music is by Richard Miller and Scott's

bad but your your take home pay three thousand as thirty six thousand a year so that means you're probably making about forty five thousand before taxes is on right\nNow and go home at each pay take is a thousand and some and so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety two inch off point tell about three thousand of my you know how it all

[noise]\nWhat it did on a break 'cause I was just Googling a chart of how long it would take in some of the dates of when you could start and when it would do that when it would bloom for you I was looking in you know they said when you start December first getting it ready or you're going to have blossoms like January seventh to January twenty eighth\nSo that's one of the reasons why I was like we got to fertilize and get going at this point out and like your fertilizer wet just like an all purpose fertilizer um you know you could be using like a liquid fertilizer [noise] um [noise]\nFrom a ... they have some great liquid fertilizers or you could use 'em like an all purpose like a ten ten ten might be a little bit much but something along those lines um Neptune harvest fertilizers are good but your only doing it like um\nYou're doing it maybe twice a month okay you know every fourteen days or so it's it's one of those quicker relief fertilizers like that liquid fertilizer uh that doesn't sit in the soil not that's slow release um because he at this point you want that quicker released to the bald\nHires the slow release um you could use like an ... that type to put in there but you know better fertilizer for what you're looking for is a that quicker release that liquid formula [noise]\nSo all that being said that's one of the reasons why I was pushing you a little bit too you start getting it ready I'm going forward in the future you know end of August beginning of September and that's how you give it that that two month period like that six to eight week period um\nYou could still do that at this point 'cause I'm I'm looking at six to eight weeks from now\nI'm would be six weeks from now is going to be a bright before Thanksgiving down and so that's going to give you it might not give you enough time to write a Christmas I might be a it might be a New Year's type I'm blossom or a little bit after that so\nKind of look at it going forward as it you need six to eight weeks of of doormen see I didn't take six to eight weeks for it to blossom again so about a four month process to really get it to the date that you want so we're looking back at\nUm [noise] so it would be that August twenty fifth if you wanted it for the Christmas Day just about up and\nUm to to really start that process I'm so going forward you can do that but this way I Would definitely start getting it going now I'm overweight now about what uh Fifteen days and you'll have it right around Christmas or unless you wanted a little bit before 'cause blossoms do last\nAh you know a little bit more than a week a town you know than fourteen days maybe even more so you don't have an early might be nicer that way you can guarantee that you have those flowers for that a Christmas Celebration [noise]\n\nAnd then we're going to the break again so I Do apologize [noise] um I Know you have a question about Dahlia so if you have if you have some time and want to hang on we can get to that value right after the break [noise]\nFor number here's a five five six six zero four to six once I got an eight five five six six zero four to six one [noise]\nHow would you like the guy to be green this year yes as possible with virus they product\nOr are they as an organic wheat and graft killer roundup organic disease control organic insecticide organic mold and build a

like ... and I\nYou the phone number of years eight five five six six zero four to six one again eight five five six six zero for it\nAnd I think you the phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six one again eight five five six six zero four to six one eye or\nSomeone to share one more time we had called a couple of times today\nUm that last time gave me goose bumps I I I went upstairs my mom had stayed over with us told my my wife and my mom the story that lead told me over the air we all got goose bumps solely awesome thank you die he called back to that your wife was born on November thirteenth\nAh so that's pretty cool thirties an awesome number I'm\nLeads me into my next point\nOr being able to do this show I now gets you a say happy birthday to my loved ones and\nMy ... my oldest Katie is going to be three years old and a four days so I was pretty cool stuff I get to announce it on the radio she gets to hear it and I'm saying that early so I can be one of the first to say happy birthday Katie I so\nJust a very personal cool stuff's the phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six one a Nathan who's up next [noise]\nForeign and New Hampshire Warren welcome to the ballpark guarding clump how can we help you\nI mean\nI I understand I Do as well\nI live in a [noise]\nA lot of the trouble Yeah Yup\nYup no exactly [noise]\nLike on a fertilized and right\nSo the liquid lawn fertilizer I Would do that more during the spring and summer um there's not a lot of government\nI mean Adam Sandler\nYeah I'd be to some of those liquid fertilizers for for lines are more fast acting they're not longer period of time [noise] um so I Would use those um earlier in the year I'm more of a\nSpring and summer like that I'd\nSay maybe a mid to late spring or early summer and then\nPart of the early summer okay uh do that a couple of times I'd rather have a dynamic yeah you can do it about two three times maybe for a cause depending on the ... just so depending upon the liquid fertilizer or that you're publishing tire\nSo that the liquid fertilizer that ... you know if you were to use it in the in ... during those times is a faster acting that doesn't stay into the soil as long as it's not a slow release whereas you're granular fertilizer czar\nHence why there's only like for an application processes um I like to say it's a five application process\nOr where's the grandiose you'd be putting a lotta times you'd be putting them down the last time you would have put down was about the end of August September usually wait about six to eight weeks in between and then he'd put their your fifth\nApplication down the reason why at this point I Want to put a granular fertilizer down is because you're really feeding for the win all winter but into the springs and the liquid you don't want it has a um [noise]\nThe liquid tries to produce more growth the granular fertilizer at this time of year is trying to help the root system and produce for next year and not ... a push a the green shoots so that's why I'd like to see you at this point do a granular fertilizer the liquids or more to push grows up\nA corrupt yet I I kind of problem naming I have a a\nA a garden and I got a long time and they were good okay um [noise] I don't\nYeah I just\nWant to make that that you know right like would and laughing\nSo what I Would have liked to do is if there is a you know find out exactly what the liquid formulation that they're using a and that they've done asked a couple of questions to them and say hey you know what I mean what are you using a because they're not going to use if they use a liquid formula it's not going to be as strong at this time of year\nThey're really focusing on the the root system in helping develop that versus shoots\nA so it's going to be a lower balance number eat at this point you don't need the uh nitrogen which would be the first number in the fertilizer because it actually is going to help clean up the plant and promote new gross\nOr and then the phosphorus wishes that mental number is going to help produce more of the the roots and take care of the the roots for the shoots so I'd like to see you ask a couple of questions and see and I'm sure if if somebody's doing\nOf the the roots and take care of the the roots for the shoots so I'd like to see you ask a couple of questions and see and I'm sure if if somebody's doing it for you at this period in time if they're going to be putting any liquid fertilizer down it's going to be a little less than the full rate it's going to be maybe half the rate\nUm so ... that could could be what's happening for you\nAnd and then\nI I I wouldn't throw away a that the ten ten ten you can use it on others but at ten ten ten at this point for the law and you're looking for it to go more than a dormant period um so I I wouldn't be putting it on there or if it was me\n\nAnd bring one and then\nYou could use the ten ten ten or you're looking for maybe a little bit heavier and the nitrogen\nA lot of times the first application if you look at a granular formulation uh it's about like twenty eight twenty nine it says usually twenty eight twenty nine zero maybe like five or ten\nNothing really but the phosphorus I see you on a heavy first number heavy nitrogen or to help produce screening of the line that type of thing and then the second step which is usually about six to eight weeks later you still have a higher nitrogen level which is you know in the low twenties\nUm with a zero phosphorus and then again with a five to ten um potassium\nSo those at that time of year that's when you'd be doing a the higher nitrogen this time of year would be lower nitrogen\nOr and I ... if you're looking to add grass seed at this point\nThey wanted to put some you know fill in some of the gaps Phyllis ... um the brown areas you wouldn't want that heavier middle number or to help reduce the roots and shoots for next year a you'd obviously got some growth this year\nBut like I said it'd be the heavy metal number at this time of year\nYou can also use that heavy metal number in the spring if you're putting seed down like I said before that mental number that phosphorous high number is for Ruth development growth and the the better you take care of your roots the better the shoots are um so that's that's something to definitely a take a look at going forward\n[noise]\nAlright warrant thank you so much for the phone call and continuing to listen to us I appreciate your kind words in regards to my father\nI can

advocate [laughter] really feel it in\nYeah wild ... one of those that are hence the name goes kind of wild everywhere and we'll just take over I'm the best time of year to really uh to kill the wild violets would be the uh the spring months or late in the spring beginning of summer\nWhat a lot of it does is it um it will be there you'll see it but it just starts Savage during the period where you're not going to kill everything [noise] um it's it's I'm not the easiest to eradicate it this time of year\nI Would definitely look at the spring but some of the growth come out as you want to see actively growing shoots you want to see actively growing broadly weeds\nOr take a look at it one of the best products that have seen out there is um\nFrom bone I it's a clover ox Allison chickweed killer\nBlows my it's clover ... and chickweed killer\nOkay um it comes in there is a trigger spray and then there's a concentrate um so the ... just spray over the areas the concentrate you would have to put in a spray or a pump sprayer but those are some of the best that's one of the best to be killing a wild violent that I've seen that\nDown well what was that caught ... that's a a bona fide product okay\nYou can find that in any of the local garden centers but it's a great product or to use the thing about it is you're going to have to do a two to three times during the year uh during the spring and early summer it's usually in about a fourteen to twenty day interval\nMaybe even just fourteen day interval\nSprained it a couple of times so once you spray it fourteen days later you spray it again and then fourteen days later you spray it again because you're going to get it at the different cycles of of it's gross\nThe down by ... go ahead and do\nI have to why do they do well\nNo watering unless it's a it's a liquid that you want to stay dry so it can ... um dry into the plant and then trends locate through the plant to to kill it um it's not something you need to water and this is a liquid form they do have like a broad leaf\nA weed killer granular form and they eat for like your step to\nThat you would use like um six weeks after you would put your crab grass prevent or fertilizer down\nBut this one is is more of a specific type of killer and so that's why I Would want you to use this I'm like I say one of the downfall of this and I don't consider it a complete downfall is\nIt's going to you're going to notice that there's going to be a lot more bare spots in the lawn or it's going to kill a lot and you're going to look at it and say oh killed everything well you kinda have to you to get rid of what you have their ...\nAnd you're going to look at it and say oh killed everything well you kinda have to you to get rid of what you have there I'll do the do\nYou say you're just going to have the receipt again after you've killed a lot of it usually at Twenty one day um [noise] interval afterwards is when you read\n'em so it's something you need to do uh to eradicate but you have to do it a couple of times and that's why I Want you to start early in the spring so you do have a good amount of time to actually received before it gets too hot for the year\nI can not gonna take a look now at ... I mean you could do some of it at this point but you're better off doing in the spring so that actively growing so you can really get rid of it you want the plant to absorb that this ... this chemical\nVersus just um having on it a little bit so that that's one of the reasons why I Want to see you do it in the spring\nAnd now I haven't had how how tall\nHold on one second for me ... we're about to go to Frank I don't want to cut you off by the other side of the break so we can answer that question fully for you or\nOr a beautiful learning garden that's healthy as they used dramatic liquid plant foods by Dram it's the organic choice to produce brilliant fruits and vegetables that are healthy for your family\nOr some of the bone I'd a grass seed products\nOnce those getting stabbed wished they actually will take a little bit less fertilizer little bit less watering um take a look at the the products that there are some out there I Know [noise]\nBecause you said you're in film if you could go down to the store and you could get a um Jonathan Green black beauty\nGrass seed it has a deeper root system so that ... system goes further down so it's drought resistant or disease resistant because it's getting out there so that's a good seemed to be putting down they have different ones um black beauty is mostly sunny it'll take some shade a satellite\nIn front of the yeah we've taken down all these trees so it's we remove the stunts that everything on but we have to put down some sort of a date because I never got it on the Cape so the ... completely different from back home in Framingham yup I'm I'm going to have to have somebody bring in like on and on and I'm ... I'm\nI'm not sure exactly what to do very handy the soil here yeah so\nI can see definitely want to add is much lumens you can if you're putting them on down you need you need a good base to it but if you could add some compost to that as well maybe what you do is you take a for the lawn you know fill it put a bunch of loomed down cover the area give yourself you know a few inches a out of that\nOr maybe you know it sounds like if some of those areas where the stumps where if your ground them down you're going to want to try to get a good base maybe four to six inches of of looming if you could the best you can to get as much there as possible not you know I'm not talking feet I'm just talking what you can really do\nRight on the opposite on top of the loom what you could do is get like a compost to do with like a top dressing when you cede that compost will break down go into there and we'll give me that organic matter that will really help salons sell ... I I think that would be an added benefit for young\nBlack today as Iraq and not and\nThat's one of the ... the globe are um grass seeds like I said\nA pro premium is a good product I have no problems with that does have a deep a grass seed I just know because I work at ... which products that they would have near you and found this and I know that a black beauty from Jonathan Green would be a good product for you to use\nOkay as far as um the ornamental grass is how much maintenance that require\nSo a lot of them they they're really very low maintenance you don't need to do a lot with them\nA lot of people will let them grow over the winter and just let them turn that brown and see those plumes in the air you don't really have to do much uh some people come back in the fall\nOr but the ones that leave 'em up all just kind of ... back in the spring or to get rid of some of that dead growth and that's really all you have to do to them there are some out there that really you don't have to do much no watering no anything and it just it just goes um they clump when they get big there's all shapes and sizes and colors a says it's really\nThe really ready for the landscape\nYeah they're great addition to the landscape because it's a different look than your normal like as ... and ... and that type of thing it just has a different texture different look for you\nRight right so you cut them down to zero in the spring and then they just throw back without any kind of ...\nThat type of thing it just has a different texture different look for you\nRight right so you cut them down to zero in the spring and then they just grow back is that\nThe kind of down to about like uh maybe like two inches so you see a little bit um some people will do it in the fall but I'll tell you a lot of people have kept them up because the plumes in there and nice fall um early winter interests are\nAll just pretty on almost year round\nI think yes definitely I I Would agree with you on that so that's you know that's why a lot of people don't cut them down I I personally wouldn't cut it down in the fall but in the spring you're getting rid of that dead growth that's a that's there if you look at some of the ornamental grasses and you look\nAt the at the pot you'll notice some of that brown stems are still there early in the spring when he would go into a gardens that or do have some great growth but there's some brown stems from the bottom and that's from cutting them back so that they can rejuvenate and that type of thing\nRight okay the other question is on for screening 'cause I don't think I Want to put up any kind of fencing yeah I Would prefer to do you know sort of staggered\nYou know the green giant ... ... a window something with those people on the Cape and with the oil city here and now the other thing was like juniper are those are good screening plan\nCould either you can do either one of those um the green giant is great um anything that's evergreen likes acidic soil as it is a so that would be good for you [noise]\nOf the growing giant thing about the green giant is is it wants to grow as tall as possible quickly and green giants going to get nice shape to it but you might need to replace it every about Fifteen Years because it's just going to get so big and full\nOf ... you could look at an emerald green are providing um it's just a little more tight\nUh you'd have to plant them a little bit closer but it's kinda nice shape consistently and it makes it nice hedge and it would you know stick around for a bit late bend\nOver though today's ... with the with the latest now do they tend to ban didn't get outta\nWill then they will bend a bit I'm One of the the better things about the Cape is you don't get as much snow as you would you know a more north in Massachusetts so that could be\nA beneficial for you but there is a way to fix that um there's a there's a trying out there called ... it's green it's biodegradable towards the this time of year maybe about a month from now you can actually tied the tree up a little bit odd to hold it from bending over\nA so it doesn't have that droopy face to it\nAs as far as some other low maintenance type plans for you you said you had a lot of sun I'd look at the endless summer hydro ranges okay and I also look at a knockout roses\nAre those two are some of the the easiest landscape shrubs to deal with\nUm [noise] excuse me by adding those into there you're not going to have to do much the great thing about it and the summer I dreams as a blooms on old and new would suffer gets cut back it's still going to bloom for you\nKnow there are the knockout roses you can cut them back in the bloom again you don't actually have to cut the knockout roses back like you do other roses\nI was gonna say do you have to produce a lot like the other roses or\nNow that's that's one of the that's one of the beauties of the of the knockout rose\nOkay and do they require a lot of fertilizer or it's\nNot really there are a lot you know don't take some of that acidic soil that you guys have down there or you could always use rose tone on them in the spring a lot longer a slower released fertilizer so it'd be a good product\nOr to use but a few of those things would be fine for you I'm One of the other things is right now it'd be a good time to be headed down to that found with Mahoney is because\nYou know I can promote him 'cause I work for them but at one of the cool things is um\nWe bring in a lot of plant late into the season uh the found this location in the Winchester location of the biggest locations from ... and we actually this past week we brought into full trailer loads of plants because we can still actively have them that doesn't happen a lot of

drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my only good traits I don't trust you\nKnow whenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be the way the world's worst\nAnd people love that even the trade group standing behind him awkwardly for an hour well he took questions a duck or go duck or you're you're very interesting because as much as you're into the traditional\nWashington speak as is the way it's always done you wide open to doing something to do with taking in Trump and noticing rather than judging notice he's doing things different but saying not necessarily he's doing things wrong that's different than a lot of a lot of Republicans in a lot of Democrats why you open to that\nBecause it's needed because the decision that the people in charge you may have been disasters not just small decisions for big decisions on the economy and foreign policy on the culture they haven't worked that's why the middle classes dying that's what Trump got elected\nThat's the best part of the downside of Trump is he doesn't know how to get things done because he doesn't understand government doesn't care about details but the best part\nIs his willingness to say obviously through things like maybe we should secure the borders or what are we still doing in Afghanistan or\nWhy are the other signatories toward trade deals not living up to their end of the bargain et cetera those are all totally true things that everybody agrees with except in Washington or the people who made the decisions are embarrassed to admit they're wrong Trump takes a lotta crap for not apologizing that's a fair criticism\nBut how about the policymakers who got us into this garbage in the first place where they apologized never want to be learned from their mistakes nothing I mean did you know what I'm saying like that's the best part about Trump is telling obvious truth is\nI always knew you as an opinion guy the Daily Caller is part of that yeah you know so do you decide to launch that\nUh and it's doing next incredibly well it's on everyone's punch list in the morning you have three o'clock in the morning for me later for you to find out what's happening new and get a perspective but the other thing is you choose to do something almost nobody else does you choose to book and engage people that disagree with you usually open how did you come to that\nOr was that a no brainer for you is that a producer they told you that this you want to have to defend your argument in your a block almost every night\nNo and I mean that's organic that's what I Believe it I mean I'm very liberal in the true sense of liberal I Believe in free speech and the free exchange of ideas I Believe in openness I really do I don't I'm exactly the same on the air is I'm off the air I only say what I really think I you may think I'm a total buffoon maybe you're right but it's nice\nYou do I don't I'm exactly the same on the air's I'm off the air I only say what I really think you may think I'm a total buffoon maybe you're right but it's surely who I Am and I think that you should if you're advocating for something explain what it is you're advocating for\nExplaining reasoning what exactly are you saying these are not hard things you seek to influence public policy and the weigh three hundred million people live their lives you should have to explain it I I since the early believing that it's a core belief\nBut you also research you're not just winning it and going on instinct you are to defend your argument but you research and go to the you can go deep on your argument you can go layers deep you're not going to just out a out yell somebody well yeah\nBut I mean the the good news for me is I control what the terms are so\nI decided what we talk about and I don't you know I don't know much about the law the sea treaty or abstract art so we don't do a lotta segments on those things which is a shame it is a shame actually I'm I'm against both just for the record but we do topics that I care about that I think are really important immigration is one of them and\nI don't know that's what I'm paid to do is to learn about stuff so I Do\nWrite you you're the one who gets paid I did not know who that was so we did Britain hear the topic of the game of the book and we're gonna talk about this uh of on as long as the book is a\nOut and you want to come back but you look at the Democratic party and under a minute and you said this thing has changed I get this is a different debate we're having I asked you sent TV Patel wait till the radio audience the bottom\nAnd you know let's say that that by Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court and we don't we have no idea whether or not he said he's got the votes at this point this is going to dog him for the rest of his days I I don't think this is going to go away it's not going to go as a political issue and twenty Eighteen orange twenty twenty you weren't going to see the people who accused Brett Kavanaugh\nOn the stage of the Democratic national convention I guarantee it this is going to be a political issue all the way through the next presidential as\nWell as we pretty amazing astounding if Dr Ford was like that because she didn't want her name out there and we know that\nShe uh wondering at him and he doesn't like to fly a lot a lot about Dr Ford has not panned out [laughter]\nIt's hard to imagine just like to fly her boyfriend of six years says I never hurts you want to fly never claustrophobia she lived in a one entrance five hundred foot square apartment never mentioned sexual assault but that's up to individuals while she was a that was\nMentioned it to anyone until twenty twelve and then it came out of the therapist discussions and that it's in the notes so that that's consistent with her story that she didn't share it with him in the late nineties\nYeah so that is or something it popped up and now we also understand too quickly to the boyfriend the ex boyfriends deserve an extra grind\nThe Dr Ford helped a friend of hers prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr ... went in detail what to expect how polygraph work and help with clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam when asked did you did have you ever take one and prepare for 'em before said she\nHadn't yeah no I mean that if that if his story is true that the potential for lying under oath and that it was interesting question when it came up when the prosecutor after that question did you ever health any more of a path I see where she's coming from here and now it appears that perhaps they had you know some of that testimony that led to that question I thought that was very interesting so with\nThis next story is fascinating because I've been out of you who feels like he's on a roll with Stormy Daniels which is an odd thing to say a feels like I got another client and this guy's going to blow everything up yes she did a her credibility\nShe goes out there and says well your your your Brett Kavanaugh was by the punch bowl did he spike it no\nWe still have now I was standing there at though handing solo cups around standing there at ... girls drinks who came to the party to go to a party I Would assume\nParties that he's even confirm these there and she's a college person and then she stood outside a doorway when there was group sex going on and he might have been somebody who\nHas a reminder of ... she's got so many ... and she was asked you know why are you at this party when you're in college and they were in high school and she said oh there were people of all ages there from like Eighteen Fifteen to like twenty five I think she said you know and then I\nI mean it's just so her story has so many holes in it it's incredible I I Can't figure out and then he said oh can you know some of your friends who are with you there verify that you were there and NBC called all four of the friends they couldn't get one of them to verify her story\nAlan Dershowitz was on he said that I think that outbreak capital should be confirmed but he wanted to see an FBI\nInvestigation first Kavanaugh's streaks she speaks he says I think they're I think he's in it you know I think you should be confirmed but I still want to see the FBI investigation and I would start and I didn't know where it's coming from the time which went ... that's the third accuser for tours of why ...\nI think the FBI to investigate everything\nSport that I didn't know where it's coming from the time which what Nick that's the third accuser for yourself why ...\nI think the FBI to investigate every single one of her claims and if it turns out if it turns out that she made it up out of whole cloth\nThat she never met Kavanaugh but she was several years older than\nThat she along with others or by herself\nSimply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury and she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment because we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world that there is no genetically linked\nAspect of telling the truth\nI think that he makes an excellent point and\nI think this is what we all need to get back to the idea that all women should be believed is a false premise we need to strip away gender from questions of truth to it doesn't matter who's the man and who's the woman in his toys what matters\nIs who's telling the truth and you know there's a lot that we still need to discover there's a ton of these stories out there but if you strip that\nAway you are at least on the right course to figuring out where the truth lies\nYeah and I think that's where we're at a no win Donald Trump junior was asked the question are you more worried for your son or your daughter about this in the future he says no doubt for my son's here's where Donald Trump senior said cutting\nThis is a time when your father one your husband or your brother one you saw a terrible thing just a person was never meant that are just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nThem sad situation to think about your son has\nBeen really worried about more your your daughter or your\nYou know what I worry about them equally when it comes to this and\nI Would say that one of the big lessons for young women from this whole thing is as hard as it is if something happens to you\nYou need to document it right away you need to tell people what happened do you need to tell your parents you need to tell the police you need to have whatever evidence you can possibly grow up in that situation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that what you say happened to you that is my message for young women and\nI think it's a very important for young men they need to be extraordinarily careful because we're living in a time\nAnd the meat you moment where the pendulum has swung too far and where an accusation becomes an indictment and that is not the judicial system that we live in in this country\nExactly a and by the way the other thing I Want to go to Theresa W okay be 'cause there's another as you wanted to bring up with you Teresa Martha ... so you're getting sued for short seven o'clock you want to talk with the protesters\nYeah um my issue with them is just like with the women have accused him like the protests are in the elevator because she wants to come out there and screen every one thinks oh my gosh something that\nHappened to her how do we know that I feel like I Believe the liberals when they said they will do what ever it takes\nTo keep a Trump appointee off the bench what makes anybody think that these women are the type of people that could do that because we saw that\nOn TV we saw all the women wearing them Johnny hats we saw what they were doing and we heard what they were saying I mean there was a woman I Can't remember what accuracy\nThat was shown on TV talking about very gross things that go along with women's bodies every month and it's almost like they were wanting to blame all men I just don't get it right that's the kind that come out and they say that this happened to me we don't know that\nThey would they be ought to be on that\nYou don't know whether or not you know the women in the elevator went through these experiences I'm gonna see and they did I I I think they probably did um but their experience does not translate to this situation these crimes are individual crimes\nThey're not a broad brush that you have all men with each one of them it needs to be determined on its validity and so do you know Jeff Flake and Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine afford their situation that they're all determining the truth is completely separate from every other one of these situations where bill\nCassidy do when he was confronted yesterday listen\nEvery law there is a\nFor you okay with the person to go\nThey're the\nAre you OK as a person to go ahead and primaries charges for\nSome\nYou're starting to fall through why\nI hadn't heard of that exchange that is really remarkable\nAnd it's a it's a very evident of what's going on and it's not you know ... I ... in a very interesting also that the the president tapping into about you know your son has because that that's a very bold strategy and the president never shies away from saying that he something that he thinks is tapping into what a lot of people are feeling in the country but I Do think that men are\nThe majority of which are good and and don't spend their time assaulting are attacking women feel under siege I\nAnd we're actually can do a men's panel tonight we get a women than on the other night uh for moms and we had people on both sides of the fence who felt that you know Kevin I was was guilty and and other women who said that you know that they didn't feel like the charges have been proven tonight we're going to talk to men are about how they feel about about this issue\nGreat a much ... going to host a show at seven o'clock tonight we're back to wrap up this hour rank amateur\nChallenging conventional thought Adam wisdom with Brian kill made [noise]\n[noise]\nHave you ever looked at your credit card statement have been shocked by the interest rate did you know you can actually roll all of your credit card debt into one monthly payment\nAt a lower fixed interest rate light stream offers credit card consolidation loans from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay lower than average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Torrington", "day": "07"}
