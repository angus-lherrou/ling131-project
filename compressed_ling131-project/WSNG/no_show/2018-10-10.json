here this Saudi contributor who writes for the Washington Post he went in to the Saudi consulate in\nIstanbul, Turkey a week ago\nI had to get some type of marriage licensing issue for him to marriage or to marry his uh I think it was a Turkish fiance and anyway the story is is that he went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never came out\nAnd the issue here is is that he has been tough on the Saudi royal family and has written about the Saudi royal family and the speculation is is that\nThey took him out uh yeah not for coffee I mean they took him out I mean we're talking Tony Soprano like here\nBecause the stories are that he went in both never came out and that there were some a Saudi diplomats or some Saudi a potential for news that came into town and then they left quickly\nAnd there are stories being floated that this journalists are Jamal ...\nThat he might have been chopped up into pieces images Saudi conflict and then taken out that way instead of like you know rolling them up on the carpet or something a little more conspicuous so this guy checked them and healing checkout ... and\nThere's a call for and the Saudi conflict or they they they showed I I think they they they they showed all they talked about that he went in\nOh for and the Saudi conflict or they they they showed I I think they they they they showed or they they talked about that he went in well

and said there's nothing funny about this I mean I Know the Washington Post their uh up in arms here about a hour journalists that of course the last couple of years have been very dangerous for

and whether that's the entirety of it I just don't know but uh we don't have any other\nPublic explanation at least at this point\nI Know that there were people who are raising questions about the way the president did it because he said I'm I'm holding an event it'll be at the White House I have some big news to announce about my great friend Nikki Haley I thought it was a classy way to give a send off to a really valuable\nFormer employee which maybe every Abbas in America should take a lesson from that\nUh and and I would imagine that I Hope the president can get somebody almost as good as her to replace her\nBut that may be tough these days with the ah the the left and the never Trump or is making it making a job in the Trump Administration look as an unattractive as they possibly can make good luck\n[noise] well that's for sure of one of the names that as being rooted about I have to say I'm I'm very apprehensive about and that is a a woman who formally was a H R McMaster's deputy at the national Security Council um owned by the name of Dina Habib\nPowell and um she may or may not have an easy time in the Senate I don't know but\nUm you know one of the things that many of us of the buyer usually about a ... of course has been um the absolutely forthright and tenacious and\nWell even courageous championing of American interests in the United nations specifically in the middle east and most especially with respect to Israel and unfortunately\nIn my experience Dina it'd be Powell is not the Nikki Haley on any of those things and those are of course the president's policies so you'd expect her to chat with them but um she has been\nIn again my experience I'm very much susceptible to the uh the blender Smith shall we say of the Muslim Brotherhood and the United states she hails from Egypt originally um and I think this will be a terrible mistake so I Hope that's not the president's gonna wind up but uh you're right\nOr is that anybody is going to face of the gauntlet uh unless this is going to come up presumably after a ... on the election and perhaps the Democrats will be chastened a let's hope so\nWell tell me this one thing's I fail to understand Frank is when someone takes a job\nWorking for someone or some thing either an entity a business entity or ... political entity a and says I really don't\nSubscribe to the beliefs of this entity the policies are the charter of this group or I don't know I'm going to work for a person and I don't agree with him but I'll take the job\nAnd then all deliberately and we've seen this happen in the Trump Administration a bunch of times\nThe last two years just say I'm going to take the job and then I'm going to do whatever the heck I Want to do with the job no matter what the boss things why do people do that and why did they get away with it\n[noise]\nThink they do it because they often have the hubris a to think that they know better than the president appointed them to that position they often or or even contemptuous\nOf the person who did the job and the question is as you say get away with it um and unfortunately in the first year of the Trump Administration there was all together too much of that\nUh I think probably at least in part because of the president was\nYou know spending most of his waking hours trying to contend with the various um a investigations allegations and uh and other personnel challenges and the occasional crisis or to end up as a result\nYou know folks who should have been called to account words and it only incentivize them to do more of it and frankly it serves as an example for others to do the same so that's a problem and I think it's gotten considerably better my sense of it at least as a with my palm pilot\nYeah it serves as an example for others to do the same so that's a problem and I think it's gotten considerably better my sense of it at least is with my palm pilot state and John Bolton that the national Security Council or at least in those parts of the of the national security arena\nThe that's the thing I've wondered about because frankly honestly there are some groups in the ACLU called me up and said will pay a pile of money to come down and be our press spokesman for the ACLU I'd say thank you very much know\nImmediately know I I don't fit I I Believe in civil liberties I don't believe in the way that they're doing it on the other hand there might be individuals that I Would say yes to quickly or no to quickly\nBut I Can't imagine going to work and promising to take a pay check to do a job intending to not do the job because I think and and intending if anything\nTo undercut the you know the the beliefs in the philosophy of the person I'm going to work for unless I sat down with them and said yeah I'll go to work for you but I Believe the way you been doing things is wrong and you can do much better if you do it my way and if your employer your\nPerspective employers is why you're probably right we'll let you change the way we're doing things\nThen you might take the job but deciding to deliberately torpedo your employers to satisfy some other goal I I just do not under the I Can't wrap my head around it Frank\n... well ... and this is why you know unfortunately uh we have a lot of slumped creatures and very few Lars Larson but so we could we could use a lot more of you here I can tell you that\nAnd again it it I called it the phenomenon of the subordinate subordinates um during President Trump's first year in office or H R McMaster as I mentioned Dina towels old boss of was a prime example of this and and you know I think it was talking about this before but just right off the ...\nThe day he joined the national Security Council he announced his staff that he did not approve of the use of the term radical Islamic terrorism which you may remember was something the president actually said repeatedly and ... pain for us as\nOn as a platform of what was going to be different about his administration from Obama's it it was just one early indication that he was a bad choice and a mistake and I'm so grateful that he's gone and uh so appreciative that John Bolton was selected as has replaced but go ahead who has a lot lately either\nI think Ambassador Bolton is the best and frankly [laughter] Frank I'm Talking to Frank Gabby from the center for Gary policy I think it'd be the height of dishonesty to walk in\nIt would be like having a neighbor who says on a regular basis Lars I'm planning that you're going to die soon uh it'd be tough to negotiate with somebody like that\nShouldn't we push back against that kind of thing and even be a little bit belligerent since all the you know warm fuzzy talk of the last Thirty years hasn't really brought the Palestinians anywhere even when Arafat was offered a uh a Ninety eight percent of what he wanted he said no\nHe wants the Jews are bad and the guy how do we looked\nAt all I think it's a little bit more like a if your neighbor you were living in your neighbor's backyard if that are going to get back and then she do despite it'd be U.S foreign policy that you ought to [noise]\nAh so are the Palestinians are far from perfect uh and I agree with you it Arafat ah made a mistake in those negotiations but ah I think it's the Netanyahu government that has refused to shape now are not Palestinians\nOr is that the is a real obstacle to peace there but I mean that you know that issue or is it is a hardly the most important one little or evaluating Haley I think ah her her policies are her statements on North Korea Syria where she really seems to want us to try to overthrow aside\nOr which I think would bring a a messy chaos tried it and Iran are or where the biggest problems were\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war as I recall bronco bomber ran as the anti war president and he ended up putting troops into Syria or\nWithout telling the public for a long long time he ended up putting troops a number of places he didn't get that while he got them all the way out of Iraq and then ended up putting about six or eight thousand back into Iraq because pulling out a while you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did and then we ended up\nWas him back into Iraq because\nPulling out a while you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did\nAnd then we ended up having to put troops ride back in there\nAnd and yet the constant drumbeat I heard before Trump was elected and after he was like does this guy is going to get us into a war it seems to me that the previous president Brock Obama got us into more conflicts or put people in harm's way and more conflicts than this president has and this president\nHas actually figured out how to get North Korea at least come to the table and he's and he's taking a hard line with the Iranians which one is the more pro war President Trump or Obama\nBut I'm not sure I I certainly with guns or almost all this this does not Obama date I Wish\nObama hadn't a continued a lot of the war the inherited her ended the war in Afghanistan or\nGun that's more deeply involved in Syria or helped overthrow the government of Libya I opposed all those things that thought they were ... uh I think uh the Trump Administration has continued almost every or will they actually get every war they inherited\nA and I think they deserve some credit for for\nPursuing diplomacy with North Korea or by uh they bend a across the board I think a fairly illiterate but at the main thing is that you know we we have a bipartisan consensus in this country or left and right as much as they are for ... each other and vicar tend to agree and all these things but I just said\nDemonstrates that so I disagree with both\nSides and both parties presidents when they are advocate or is that I think are needless\nDo you think that sometimes talking in a ... tone to people who've decided to be problematic in one way or another is sometimes the best way to keep them from going too far rather than try to you know the nice warm fuzzy approach to them because that never seems to work\nWe we do try the nice warm fuzzy approach a at time certainly uh the Trump Administration does with certain countries\nA Saudi Arabia for example uh that are problematic uh I think a\nDirt of course there are times ... threatening a but at the example that I mentioned doesn't bass or Haley doing it I thought were mistaken\nA week she threatened for example uh she said it was U.S policy that we would bomb the north Koreans if they had an ICBM then he has an ICBM it'll be getting bombed them so I think you know if you're going to make threats\nThey should be ones that you're prepared to act on it and that case I think it's freelance thing and not a following any sort of broader policy that had been articulated and I think that that sort of empty plaster is is bad for us credibility and our reputation\nActually agree with you there as for the Israelis living in the backyard of the Palestinians professor one last thing in the last forty seconds when countries go to war on this planet isn't it generally the case that when the the boundaries are said when the hostility sees that they stay where they are until the two sides strike a peace correct\n[noise] for\nOkay I'll like North Korea and South Korea we don't know ... the end of that war so we have this DMZ down in the middle in and out towards stays until you strike a peace the Israelis that people have made war on the Israelis and they took property a in those conflicts and they hang on to wait until somebody's willing to strike a peace which they can do anytime they want\nAnd which they have vastly resisted being willing to do that kind of thing and transfer Friedman I've always appreciate your insight even when we don't agree on saying thank you very much and you're listening to Lars Larson show

the way during the U.S Senate debate in Indiana yesterday or the folks at Reuters which is not a bad\nNews organization they're not as far to the left as the Associated Press they say it was difficult at times to tell which candidate was the Democrat and which one was the Republican as they both routinely cited their support of president Donald Trump's agenda you live in a liberal state like how do I live in the state of Washington\nThat must be wonderful to be in a state where Democrats and Republicans want to say how much they support President Trump imagine\nBeing in a state that conservative or Joe Donnelly a first term senator is trying to stave off a challenge from a Republican businessman Mike Braun\nAnd in doing so keeping alive democratic hopes of taking control of the United States Senate after November sex the congressional elections Donnelly is spent much of his campaign touting his record of working with Trump on health care and veterans' issues but\nBraun went after him yesterday during a debate for his opposition to the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh Donnelly even went as far as to adopt the slogan promises made promises kept used by Trump's reelection campaign as his own motto during his closing statement\nThat may be reaching a bit far\nDiners do we have diamond and so now because I Love talking to these ladies there are a lot of fun is she really oh they're\n... ladies welcome to Lars Larson show you've been on before when we were back in Washington DC it's great to have you back\nOh thank you thank you for having us\nAnd you got the new dummy grads documentary now clearly from that name it is not going to be a a documentary about the wonderful successes of the Democratic party and all the wonderful things the Democrat officeholders due for we Americans is is\nThe wonderful things I Try to live with having the Jim Crow days in place keeping people that we could talk about it but the movie is really you know we know the president is joining us while\nWe're doing it both in the swamp and then the on the ... yeah we're going into the district with women and men that\nLike the Maxine Waters who say we have to impeach forty five and when we get we feed the homeless people in poverty limited at that point the million dollar meant it on a one hundred and Seventy four thousand dollar salary and like any other tool wicked either were not held in anything back\nAnd they're all dumb encouraged by the way it it premieres on the fifteenth of October so coming right up and I take it you timed it very nicely for the election\nI don't know if it was but they felt the need that up when they came to the particular being painted in the movie I thought that needed at the American people to speak out at the show the top of the things people we hate them up at the American people\nCall them out on that we get to criticize them because\nThat is right to make sure you go to the Democrats the movie dot com that's done the ... the movie dot com they get your ticket one night premier I talked with a ... we want to see your face and the play\nAnd merely area you want to join diamond it helped that night and be with that night to be a way you can go to a diving into dot com take one Democrat if they're going to be I pay for an event and get your take is right there for that\nHaving been in the presence of these two wonderful lady's I Know what it's like and it's you got to be on your game you've got to be paying attention because otherwise you're gonna miss half of what they say because they it comes out so fast it's like standing under a waterfall wonderful conservative point of view\n\nThey it comes out so fast it's like standing under a wonderful wonderful conservative point of view\n[laughter] how you know that's an ... path and all you have a passion for your country you love your country and we used to the left leaning liberals try to destroy the country\nTrying to push through these movement that America could no longer exist the way we know it you know we have to stop this foolishness we're not gonna know we're not going to have a country and so that's why we just talk about what we talk about\nI'm Talking with diamond and so the Internet and say things and I was just hearing was my audience this outrageous statement by Hillary Clinton who I guess things she's still a player or by coming out and saying we can't have civility until you give us power back\nSo and I thought you're really going to keep up with these protests and the funny knit hats\nAnd pounding on doors and yelling at people and threatening people in restaurants in public places until we give you power back that it doesn't seem like the right way to get it\nLike a dictator that may be like a day in order to dominate you know let's go back to the Democrat Party the quote they want to put them on all sides and the prize at sometimes people just look at it\nI Want everybody and I don't even care what side of the hour on if you like to get to be up our country that the plane is that these bats\nThe makeup people guilty and they got to figure out how to themselves in that I don't try to dismantle the constitution one to be white it when they need to we waited till like that you need to get out the way it and you need both Republicans and I mean they are\nAnd also look at what happened whenever the Democrat did have power they had it for eight years and what did they do for this country\n... unemployment rate it it was out of the the window they send jobs overseas and look at what they actually did for this country when they did have power do we want that again and Obama\nWhen he had and they have an old bottle thought that killing and I told you have a coconut smile and I had to work for the leaders would he looked up top that and how they were up at bat third\nString that's right okay today's got bad you know what I Love about the president and behold in Hollywood actually hit the hold it to the American people and that could either working for\nMom tell you what maybe a Hollywood good way I Love the fact that you've done it a ... documentary 'cause I think I've loved documentaries forever I used to make them for TV stations and you know none of mine have been as successful as I Know dummy crowds is going to be\nBut I thought it was a great way of getting a point across if you do get people with a ten second attention span to sit down and watch it\nI Believe that it's not\nThe both the left is saying they were telling people to pay attention to us right we've been we've been bamboozled by the less\nThey claim that they want this is that the mayor ...\nWhat you want if you're truly wanted to ... percent of America's why did you come to the table for tax cuts America would have been successfully\nGuinea more money in their pockets why did you come to the table and things we want to be said he'll come to the table when you want to take a fact that they somebody you see 'em out dentistry at the end he bought the industry and you know back in the day it was the KKK what why\nNow you got and people were black mad crazy if you don't like what's happening you know going to have the you know you're going to have the cabin eyes organize and go to the polls and thought we had white thought we'd probably get\nLadies it is always a pleasure You're welcome back on my program anytime thank you so much thank you for having us\nDiamond in so the Internet sensations now featured in the new movie called dummy crowds to find a way I Want to tell you about something\nLet that go um I\nNeed a great night sleep now last couple of nights I haven't had a great nicely because I've been on the road came up to Seattle heading back home tonight back to our home studios how about a great bed\nNext month November Chino nine mark Twenty years and sleeping honestly number ... how does a great night sleep improve your performance how far more energy less brain far better mood more productivity the new sleeve number three sixty smart but the one I'm going home to tonight\nA big corporations I mean I I can talk to our career fairs and say that we ... we co host a roughly a hundred and fifty of\nOK high rate a big corporations I mean I I can talk to our career fairs and say that we ... we co host of roughly a hundred and fifty of those a year all over the country we do some online these are big corporations are that are looking to recruit the highest level of talent\nYou know from the veteran pool so they do recognize it they also recognize the value of disabled veterans and what they also bring to the workforce so I think it's out there\nUh but we do struggle with the fact that uh unemployed as unemployment goes down and and everybody's thrilled about where the rate is right now\nAnd that's great were behind that one hundred percent but the overwhelming majority of those that we deal with on a direct bases are are not unemployed underemployed and in some cases over employed\nWell Jeff here's the thing we hear about discrimination in the workplace all the time\nAnd yet this is one of the few places where an employer could correct me if I'm wrong literally discriminate in favor an employer well I think Wal Mart did this not long ago said we are going to hire ten thousand votes and if they were effectively saying to everyone else yeah we're going to hire them first that the law allows them to do that\nThey'll say we're going to hire vets were going to give preference to vote so I Know there are a lot of government jobs that give preference to vets and then you take into account the fact that a veteran of the who's done service is likely in some cases more finish the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman and\nThen if you factor in the Americans with Disabilities Act that says you legally have\nTo accommodate people's disabilities you think that the veteran would be in the cat bird seed for getting jobs that are available that they want to pursue the careers they want to do am I missing something or because you said that the surveys show that not quite two thirds more certainly more than half\nOf all veterans are worried that when they go out in the workplace or their disabled they're going to face discrimination I Would hope they'd see not only employers saying we will follow the ADA and accommodate your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant is that not happening\nI I think what you know with a statistic that ... that comes from a survey that we are we you know that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans\nYou know fear discrimination in other words um they understand the position that they're in a ... but when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join a police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability uh because I think a lot of it really comes from the stigma that\nYou know you don't do that over the years that was taboo to do that you kind of keep that thing to yourself\nUm where in fact I Believe where we are today in society is exactly as you put it\nCompanies are seeking those individuals again because of the fact that they have\nYou know disabilities um you know one of the things that that we particularly uh when we started interacting with companies on a regular daily basis [noise]\nEspecially the multitude of them that career fairs is the fact that there was so much and and still so much work to do on the education front of educating employers on what a disability is\nHowever to the point the the companies are doing everything they can and creating a really really great opportunities for veterans now we got to get the veterans to understand that hey\nYou need to disclose that went into proper to disclose it uh companies want to hire you because of it because there are tax incentives for them financial incentives for them to hire you\nAnd it just trying to get both of them and bridge that gap that's where that you know our our ... guide to hiring and retaining veterans with a disability is is really that we've released this month as hopefully going to help on both sides of the table with that\nSo Jeff

Juan Williams we like to call and Conrad but you see them on Fox News you read his columns and now\nHe's got a brand new book out that I just I looked at the title of this and I thought one I got to talk to you\nThe title is get this what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights one welcome to the program\nAlways a pleasure Laurie thanks for having me on to talk about the book\nIt is a pleasure to have you on to talk about this book so I Want you to start with what is the biggest thing that Donald Trump is done to try to adversely affect the civil rights of Americans\nOh I Would guess number one would be that voters depression as a effort you know they said oh it was about voter fraud we're going to start a convention I think his his feelings were hurt that Hillary Clinton beat him in the popular vote by three million so he said that that didn't happen fake news I\nActually was voter fraud and so we got Chris Cole back from Kansas and then they're going to start a commission well guess what they couldn't find anything but they allow state legislatures to go on in terms of closing polling places and minority areas\nUh increase requirements for voter id each changing the time for voting I think I think he doesn't think that a minority is going to vote Republican I think that's ...\n... one I don't see that as voters would pressure and I wanted him to check and make sure that every one of the cast a ballot is an American citizen entitled to cast a ballot and in fact\nIn the two years since the sixteen election you and I disagreed on a in those two years we've seen people actually prosecuted for voting in ... from voting without having any right to do it which ended in\nPennsylvania we've seen it in Texas and other places and I honestly don't think that election authorities many of whom are Democrats and liberal stage really care whether people vote illegally are not\nHere is the reality there is none there is no major I mean you might find one in Iran has been stare at one point they thought they had something up in New England some state and federal college kids will voting here and they actually are from other areas\nEven though they're going to college and then they ... oh no the state law allows college students to vote so this is what happened this is why they had this band\nThere's even though they're going to college but then they were oh no the state law allows college students to vote so this is what happened and this is why they had this ban that commission because it was based on a big fat\nNothing but you know I think your initial question Lars is very intriguing what actually\nHas Trump done that were damaged civil rights in this country yeah I don't think we should ban this conversation much farther without saying his rhetoric is the way he talks has been absolutely\nDivisive including the title of this book because it comes from his language what the hell do you have to look at him\nAnd he's talking to an all white audience at\nBy a them and they all Michigan and he's as many people reported as if he was saying oh to the black community here in neighborhoods are so poor you don't have\nJobs look at the poor quality of your schools why do you vote for Democrats why not vote for me Donald Trump great question well and I think the first of all this he's not talking to the black community he was talking to the white community about the black community and I think he was saying\nThose people over there are so broken so dysfunctional fill with cats and violent and I Donald Trump will stand in the breach like a hero and I won't be a snowflake I'm gonna call 'em out and I'm going to keep 'em away they won't muggy they won't take your dad's I thought my guest he is absolutely\nDemonizing the black\nCommunity hounded you I I'm just confused as to how you read black community into that I think what he was saying was you voted for conventional Republicans before and you didn't get what you wanted\nYou voted for conventional Democrats before and Brock Obama I think most of the black community has conceded that he didn't really deliver much for them what do you have\nTo lose votes for me and they did it and by the way one I'll just point this out Donald Trump has brought black unemployment to its lowest in recorded history\nAnd allow to blogs and the number of new black businesses in the last two years almost two years of the Trump Administration because of the changes regulation because of the boosted economy the percentage of new black businesses up by four hundred percent\nNationwide now those two things have a dramatic effect on the positive nature of black employment and black entrepreneurship that's a good thing right\nWell at the numbers are right that's a very good thing because I think the primary accomplishment of the U.S civil rights movement you know going back\nTo the Nineteen fifties like say if you start with fifty four and ground going forward to the passage of a civil rights back and fix before and by the way the book is structured on the basis of the provisions of the civil rights back looking at\nVoting rights housing education and the like employment law um but here's the reality Everytime President Trump calls a black woman a dog or says a black people have extraordinarily low intelligence I think that's what he said about Maxine\nWaters the Democratic critical and\nI Would agree Maxine Waters does have extraordinarily low intelligence but again I think that's very literally is I just mainly routes one on one\nLet me get spending our point here is going on about you know a LeBron James is so down me makes Don Lemon look smart and Don Lemon as dumb and of course you know his divisive rhetoric was the start of his political profile because he was involved in saying Brock Obama is not an American totally fraud you know ugly and he continued even after\nHe'd been proven wrong and then he comes and says well anytime anybody says that you have a problem with race Mr ... he says but look at the low unemployment rate and without saying oh that low unemployment rate Ninety percent of it is attributable to\nBank you Obama it's only dropped one percent since he's been in office and the black unemployment rate remains twice the white unemployment rate with him doing nothing to try to correct\nYou want you want to correct result in this case I think that rising tide of the entire economy is going to lift all boats but does that mean one that you're telling me that if I go on the air and criticized Chuck Schumer I'm not being a racist 'cause truck is about as wide as you can get but he's also Democrat but if I criticize Maxine Waters or Sheila Jackson\nLee who just had a staff member arrested for you know some crimes that they committed involving the public's information that if I criticize Sheila Jackson Lee I'm a racist because Sheila Jackson Lee is black\nAnd might not allowed to print is the president not allowed to criticize black people for fear of being labeled a racist or should all Americans be subject to criticism especially when they serve in high office\nYou know you're talking to somebody who's at heart Lars and you know me well you're my friend but you know that I came up as a journalist I reporter like a ... a ... a street the ink stained reporter so they're not in my whole spirit is about\nHolding powerful people accountable and telling people what the powerful with the establishment is doing in this case\nWhole spirit is about holding powerful people accountable and telling people what a powerful with establishment is doing in this country and trying to get them to act\nRight so that's me but you can criticize anybody of any color any gender any ethnicity nationality that you want but to me when you do things like say good people find people are marching when they are not these white supremacist\nAnd one of them kills people and they're standing outside a synagogue with tiki torches and automatic\nWeapons than ours I think you don't understand the history of humanity much less the history of the un I\nWanna I criticize those people I don't hesitate to criticize them but I also criticized the black Panthers\nWho stood out in front of the a pug Pennsylvania polling always an\nEmbattled unless you're being now you're being racist because you're criticizing the black Panthers no I'll criticize anyone who tries to keep Americans from voting but I don't think Donald is trying to keep people from voting I think he's saying\nThere are reasons to suspect that our voting system is flawed a theory that Democrats are agree with if you bring Russians into the picture and then as soon as you take Russians out of the church and that seems to falling apart they say well now you can't criticize ... whether or not our voting system is subject to possible fraud\nBut I'm staying on the ground the bigger issue right now is making sure that Americans can exercise their constitutional right to go we want more people participating in our election system we want more confidence at a time when the institutions in this country especially the institutions of government aren't such low but well\nJurisdiction of California is automatic registration of people automatic registration\nYou're talking about voter id yeah well I'm Talking about it for a for people who are getting a car like a license to dry out\nAnd and I'm a million a million people in California who are illegal aliens have driver's licenses and their automatic voter registration well they're not ... not\nLegally large legal you guys are making stuff up on the ... thing\nYou can't shoot at heroin ... either but it gets done a lot in the United states of America on\nOur anyway look I think the reason I met I brought up guns was that I Am someone who lives in big cities I'm not a hunter I Am threatened by people with guns didn't and I have\nOne yeah see that's your response but I look at all the murders look at all the mass murders look at what goes on in school when people get these guns that so willy nilly it is a mess and on and we are not protecting ourselves or our actual\nI Want to ask you a theoretical question this goes to a civil rights in his book is called what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights\nIf you were to arm any of the people in the great city of Chicago who are law abiding citizens if you arm them with guns legally unlawfully the ones who want to be armed what do you suppose would happen to crime in the famous murder capital of America Chicago Illinois\nIf there were more guys they'd be more death\nNo more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens\nYou want and I think the arm everybody get the candidate Gardner has done\nIs they've never had that won all ... although if they can shoot well I plan to have my ... I plan to have my granddaughter shooting under adult termination by kindergarten do you think that's a good goal you should do it for your nine kids\nYeah ... I don't want her killing her friends hurt and I don't\nWant to say like a large under adult supervision now yeah other than voting where do you think that Donald Trump has gone to war on civil rights let's talk about immigration to while we have time\nYou want to talk about immigration asked me a question but I was going out into the earth or go ahead and we're doing we're out they will be gone to war on civil rights we talked about that divisive rhetoric we talked\nAbout distorting the reality of the black community focuses on the twenty percent that live in poverty disproportionately young people it's a very difficult situation link I think a lot of the history of this country beginning slavery but coming poet to legal segregation and continuing bias\nAnd bad schools so that is a problem but he ignores the forty percent of black America that earns between thirty five and a hundred thousand you ignore the additional twelve percent earns between a\nHundred two hundred these are people who are get up everyday Lars and Lars Larson conservative traditions\nGo to work work hard to try to get ahead in the face of continue racial bias in this country this has to be celebrated I Would think conservatives would say wow look at people\nWho had some difficulties faced discrimination and yet still believe in the ninth grade American Dream and believe in capitalism still a huge gap in terms of wealth between black and white America but instead\nDonald Trump he doesn't even tap into the idea of what made the accomplishment who can't\nStand to all those people are scary\nAmerica but instead Donald Trump he doesn't need to tap into the idea of what amazing accomplishment you can send it to all those people are scary and I\nMean did he ever say Harlem out do not hold on hold on listen when I'm gonna tell you something I don't have to I don't think he's ignoring them at all in fact if anything he celebrates the success of black Americans and and what is emblematic of that is the most recent public opinion polls you know these national\nPolls that are done say that black voters support for Donald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had\nAnd Mitt Romney did not have a great number of black Americans supporting him neither did John McCain delayed John McCain but Donald Trump has higher black voters support than either one of those two guys\nYou know if we want to look at polls I mean let's look at the reality of the vote and twenty sixteen I think he got eight percent of the boat you're\nTalking about a poll that did not have a significant number of black people being polled participating the reality is right now two thirds of all American people of all colors think\nRace relations in the country or worse\nIt's about the same number who say they don't approve of the way Donald Trump handled great and here's the most probably one 'cause this is something I'm very\nI'm very reluctant even uses kind of language racist but forty nine percent of Americans in a foxhole that Donald Trump so race so to me Lars if like ignoring\nThe elephant in the room and saying you know what we don't want to talk about\nRace if you don't want to talk about the fact that this guy\nIs so offensive on this issue so critical to our history into who we are because we are becoming a more diverse country will racially diverse but they're from and I don't know how we get around\nThis as I said the polls are pretty clear it's you know that poll about racism eleven percent of Republicans said he's raised ... and that's what maybe the biggest puzzle to me maybe I should ask you how could a good people decide that you know it's just the court he doesn't have a little problem with race and so you know what\nLet's just not pay attention to it all I don't want a lens that when we come back I'm Talking to Juan Williams whose latest book is what the hell do you have to lose from war on civil rights

[noise] and ah\nHe was my guest and I was so impressed with him\nHe has he has made himself a an expert in American history and loves America about as much as anybody\nAnd he\nManaged to get the employer\nWho was willing to jump through all the legal hoops\nTo get him here legally bought his uh immigration attorney said there is no work permit that fits his employment criteria\nDone said in a\nCheerful very tearful Facebook video that he would not come to the United states illegally because he respects the country too much ...\nAnd I'll be very honest with you I was so impressed so impressed by Jonathan ... that ah I wanted to invite him back\n[noise] and uh he is coming back this morning [noise] if you are around at ten minutes after seven Jonathan will uh be with us and a ... will be with us until\nTen after seven ... twenty five minutes of eight and it's a good it'd be interesting interesting to\nHear him and hear him again and I know that in fact the that that morning when I got off the air we had calls here at\nThe station ... and I took some of them and there were so many of you that the thought to Jonathan done was just\nA spectacular so I Want you to know\nThis morning he'll be joining us again and I and I truly have never heard anybody\nTalk like Jonathan did about this country and how he wants to come here but he will not come here illegally he says he respects the country too much [laughter] so you folks that can make it\nThat said that ten minutes after seven\nUh this morning President Trump is are thinking about the the federal\nReserve arguing that the central bank\nCould be a hiking interest\nRates more slowly but saying he has not spoken to the fed chairman Jerome Powell about it or the fed\nIs doing what they think is necessary\nBut I don't like what they're doing Trump told reporters on the White House south von referring to the feds series of rate increases the number that ah ... we're producing our\nRecord setting drums that I don't want to slow it down even a little bit specially when you don't have\nThe problem of inflation and you don't see that inflation coming back\nNow at some point you will and are you will go up I just don't think it's necessary to go this vast\nTrump said that he hasn't discuss his feelings directly with the uh Mr Mr Powell the fed chairman I Will say this\nWere normalizing money and that's good the president said but I think we don't have to go as fast\nI Want to be able to\nAnd that's good the president said but I think we don't have to go as fast I Want to be able to pay off debt [noise] this is my goal ... central bank a hike rates again last month or the third time this year and\nIs expected to do so once more before the end of twenty Eighteen part of his effort to bring rates back\nUp to a more normal level after a nearly a decade of boosting the economy with easy money going to be interesting to watch to see just how this works out but\nThis is a Trump all over no question\nAbout it this is going to be a this is going to\nBe a a big one of the numbers that that we're producing he says are record setting and I don't want to slow it down\nEven a little bit especially when you don't have the problem of inflation\nAnd you don't see that inflation coming back\nNow at some point we will but uh not right now is going to be interesting this is going to be interesting to see just how he\nTalks with the fed chairman Jerome Powell about about this but you know there's one thing that I observed and I'm sure many of you have to that uh what Trump wants to do is get the United states back\nTo where it belongs I think that is part of his entire philosophy [noise] he wants to make sure that we get back where we belong and this is the reason that he's not\nGiving us away at to a foreign countries like some of the other presidents did so I think this is probably the the core of what he what he wants to do and and what he believes that\nOkay twenty

for stuff announced he still remains to be seen but I\nYou know this is the new age two guys and you don't have to necessarily have buckets of money I mean we saw that with Linda McMahon she threw a hundred million bucks and she got nothing for it and and now with Facebook and social media you can target like you said you can target different groups of people with not a lot of money so maybe you know maybe that's the new plan\nWell it's a [noise] I tell you he gets a a good reception wherever he uh wherever he goes\nYeah the last couple of debates guys you know when you look the last couple of debates almost all the pond and say he clearly one no question yeah\nYeah question no question he's not afraid no no\nWhat are you guys think of Oz agreeable and does he make a difference\nI think ... could be the guy that puts them in\nIt could be a spoiler ... yeah I I think we I don't know about you but to me when you look at ... positions and his his his respect in the business community and I have to I haven't talked to us on a couple of years but I used to have him on again even if ... lead two three four\nPoints honestly where's that going to come from I mean I'd roll the dice and say it's probably going to come from Stephan ... maybe Seventy five percent of it I don't know what do you think\nWell historically these independent candidates always Rob from the Republican yeah but I sound like a Democrat more and more like a Democrat his plans are all democratic leaning so maybe maybe he got a little flip flop thing happening here maybe some of the folks who come out to vote for hours\nMay actually be letting other people I like I said every one of the polls icy and you don't see a lot of official poll you know kind of either an turtle or this this group does oppose this very very close with all within five or six points and it's certainly all within the number of independent people who are uncommitted at this point\nAnd I think and I think we're going to have one of the biggest turn out that we've had in a long long time you wait and say I think you're probably right\nAnd you know ... was you know the odds was a long he's been on the animal to even talk to him recently he's been advocating tolls for like Twenty years laws as a long time to old guy\nYeah he's been on with me since the garments that amount of a half a dozen funny 'cause me and him actually

the kind of\nInteresting yeah so you know he has been I remember I I remember Lee talking Twenty years ago and he was banging drums for tolls Twenty years ago I was only a little guy I doubt about it

but I in the meantime I've been very lucky that I got to go over there and you know in a fairly regular basis\nI Am and I get to go over there and I'm Amazed at your people so I always say this you know a lot of people always say what America has never been more divided than you ever have before our major issues in politics yes but last year it was in sixteen states I was as far south as Texas is\nAs far north north of Chicago as New York I was in liberal state I was in conservative states those in Republican states I I spoke to people from your own to always spoken college campuses I spoke to a more senior people I spoke to reach people um I spoke to you know all levels the one thing that when\nYou didn't talk politics your people are still fundamentally gold I still believe he the experience that I did not I wouldn't mind about experience last year and that was when I started talking about religion to conservatives there was a bit of a you know there was a bit of a thing disagreement there but it was not an issue wasn't any\nThere was just a major disagreement on how we see life and\nI didn't see anything wrong with that from the ice nothing wrong with that lady which do you know\nAbsolute and it was a respectful discussion we just have the you know this ... this rare thing happened we agree to disagree on we but we used to each other well\nAnd which doesn't happen anymore but your people are fundamentally goes on the case I always make his I still believe that if your people are present\nFrugal and truly evil your people deep down are fundamentally good\nDecent honest humble people you will always choose good the frustrating thing from my point of view especially when you talk politics as there are very few people giving the American people the option of good of the constitution and been a little\nBoys who are actually understanding why America is great why your federal government has settled the way it is I've seen constant attacks of how America is

you overcame them you overcame it again and eating twelve you ever came it when you overcame slavery you overcame it when you overcame the great depression Nazi isn't communism\nYour people always

I'm Sorry how does that work how does that finally people will always love them you know Republicans you know George Bush was a war monger Donald Trump is idiotic but it's it's because you don't actually explain these ideas\nYou know I Can't talk to the I have a few friends you know make the declaration of independence because you know they pull around me but you know the average American Irish person by saying hey did you ever read the MMR vaccine declaration of penance was they they have a document that says yeah\nDon't they don't leave the constitution um so that's the problem we need to get back to\nThe idea of America not laugh versus right but the idea on that is what I'm passionate about because you write the it changed the world\nAnd I always say this is one thing I always say don't let me tell you like don't take this crazy hours guy's name or could change the world the idea oh there's a there's a Crazy Artist\nProve it to yourself go do some research pick any section of society don't let me and since any section whether ... whether it's to whether it's transportation whether it's communication whether it's down to the living butter is medicine you name it you pick up\nAnd take an arbitrary point in time zero lady\nTo Eighteen hundred a day and research firm which that's sections that you picked I didn't influence you you pick yourself and how much of the month you know pick the same sex and society and look at it I Would have gone through Eighteen hundred\nEighty to to has been aiding why is it that of the bombs by science ten times a hundred times a thousand times in the last two hundred and eighty years than it has\nIn the last at first dating hundred ...\nBecause people are allowed to pursue their happiness people that are related to start up a business people are allowed to say hey you know what I I don't like the Internet I don't like Microsoft I Want to go set up a new computer\nI hey I think you you know what's cool idea you know instead of having a phone to just rings in Texas what we're going to want to create a phone rings and Texas and you can listen to your music you can listen to ... you can check your email you can go on the Internet you can take pictures\nThat that's the idea that you're allowed to do is and people will choose if you're successful or not they would say hey I'm willing to put my money that idea change the world that innovation dot determination to be free changed the world or they can change it once again\nJonathan you know one of the things when you were talking and you were saying ah you mentioned the bill Clinton you mentioned this woman that when America is that\nWay when it comes to politics when it comes to something like you were discussing however however when that\nIs over ... America is just like you are describing it overall that is how we are and I think part of the success of America is that we give people opportunities if\nThey want to vote for Ted Kennedy if they want to vote for this this is the opportunity they get in the land of the free\nBoth for Ted Kennedy if they want to vote for this this is the opportunity they get in the land of the free and uh I think they morass\nHas a great deal to do with it because they support moment you know they support the other side they support the other side no question about it or on the whole so uh this is this is another part of America that is that is wonderful that we can do all these things\nBut also the great thing about what you're seeing right now is because of technology and innovation you know if this was Nineteen sixties the media like the one of the frustrating things I have Republicans and Donald Trump is making it the media to be so by\nThe great thing about technology and twenty eight and his immediate don't have to monitor because in Nineteen Nineteen sixties when you were frightened Vietnam media was a big problem once Mt singlehandedly in America\nTook the ... just basically made the America to lose the Vietnam War which way we're winning and that was Walter Cronkite illusory ... feet from the jaws of victory\nBecause you only have Walter Cronkite every American family switch on the TV at night and the only station you could really listen to that if you want the news was Walter Cronkite in twenty eight and we don't have that anymore if you don't want to do to follow you know and that's NBC and ABC and CNN which by the way their ratings if you care but ratings are indoor toilets\nYou know like you're talking to some of these shows\nFive hundred thousand people watch CNN unlike him which has been you know through airports you know I always I don't even ...

money\nI'm trying to follow the money and I got called in to uh the federal department of education or through a the boss's office and I also have claws into the Norwich\nA department of education that I've asked them for an interview they said that they can't just do one person they have to have multiple people in the interview process because no one's ever called them on it\nSo they start as global magnet school\nAnd I looked into it and basically what they are teaching a the student is to identify as a global citizen of the United nations not a citizen of the United states\nAnd they're saying policies let me interrupt you really is a curriculum\nThat comes from the United nations not from our board of education or our department of education Hartford or from or from a Washington DC\nYou're you're saying that we are not our students are not being educated with the\nAmericans have there been ... totally get into this is a political policies school it's a policy schools that\nTeachers ... um the ... the morals of United Nations and if if if you were paying attention to the United nations with Nikki Haley um we recently withdrew from the United Nations Human rights

middle east against Christian I ... the United nations is a very very bad organization and will be\nFull that's why we see the genocide in the middle east against Christians I the United nations is a very very bad organization and when we subsidize it ah I think we pay like thirty percent of their their costs but now I\nNow we're educating our student to hate the United states cannot identify as the United states citizens from kindergarten up they will be taught in Connecticut that they are not an American citizen the our global citizen and they will be getting marching orders to become active\nIs this is political indoctrination and activists\nProgram I usually watch and to do to create troops there you're on global troops\nYou're saying that this is now going on I can go into I can go in to a school and they're doing the pledge of allegiance they're doing these I always done we\nDo not know that in the schools I I haven't taken it tore the schooling or reaches call I think the teachers memorial a school or they received I guess to learn out of all lined receipt Fifteen million dollars from the federal government\nTo set a magnet school so they set up wanting Norwich now there there were already I think uh eight of them in Connecticut\nThat were cast programs and now they're they're expanding this global citizenship throughout the entire state and this is all part of ... gift to us to make sure that we are no longer in Norwich this is where it's what's interesting this\nSystem of global governance the point is that they're training these\nKids from kindergarten on to start a new world order governance and it says it in all their material not hidden\nI'm Still you know I have a question of why we're teaching our kids to be a responding to a ... nations instead of government how\nTo be there they're fine no longer think that the cells as Americans at all\n... ... ... have you seen the actual curriculum here listen plant hires class as you have\nI have seen it I have seen it from um the originator is I have not seen it from hand it to me from the education department yet I'm going to get that but I Know where it comes from like I did the research\nBut you don't habits though I mean I Do have\nThat I have all of their all of their will go to go to the school you can go to the school and look it up yourself um they talk about\nWho this is coming out of the department of education office of innovation and improvement that's where the money came to start the magnet schools it's a five year funding program and if you go to it you can look it up anywhere on the department of education website they actually\nUse the term global citizen ... and they all they have most of the I'm not the curriculum you can't get curriculum anywhere by the way\nThey talk about global studies what it does prepares the student with a school ready skills for advancement to other you know it says ... prepares these kids for careers in civic life in the twenty first century\nNew world order there it's this is all about\nA new governance of our world know United States uh United States would just be another state within the United nations but the governance would come from\nA United Nations and I just want to say to you I can give you more information I can send it to you if you'd like\nIt but you can go to the department of education website

been donated in those Seventeen years a Cancer Institute a at Hartford Hospital I think that's fabulous yeah Brad\nThanks it it is very exciting this is the Matthew Philips kind of fun it's an annual event which started in two thousand and one um and it really was Matthew ... idea he's almost ... wrote in West Hartford he wanted to give something back because he had so many clients with breast cancer\nOr either with a personal history or who have been impacted by breast cancer and he said Andy what can we do\nTo give back to the ... so what he does is he every every year he devotes one day of providing haircuts and he and his team provide haircuts and donate all the proceeds all the tips\nAnd a ... a proceeds from the ... election to our breast cancer research program\nI'm here at the great Cancer Center at Hartford Hospital um and we will this year as you said Brad break\nThe two hundred thousand dollar mark which is amazing um because you know over the past Thirty years we've seen a forty percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer so um the news is really good the results are getting better and better we still have a one way to go um\nBut that\nIs as a result of a the kind of research that we do actively here to help improve the results from breast cancer\nAnd also supported bread is our outreach program we ... we have the only ... a mobile mammography\nProgram in the northern half of the state or van is out um at least four days every week we go to senior centers churches\nWere in the city of Hartford very frequently providing free mammograms to anyone who can't afford it or who was uninsured um our job is to detect breast cancer early if it's going to be there\nUm and prevent an advanced cancer from occurring which has a major impact on a patient on a family on a community and so we've had incredible success in getting out and detecting many cancers that otherwise wouldn't have been detected as a result of our active an outreach program\nWell again the Matthew I'm Glad that you were able to to get here and uh you're going to I Can't believe it a hundred and Ninety seven thousand donated in Seventeen years and I know that you're going to go over the ... the top so thanks for stopping by\nMy pleasure thank you very much Brad we appreciate your support\nTwenty seven minutes after eight o'clock there is another area or Mr Mayor that you know the people just it's it's growing growing growing everywhere and what they're doing\nYou know you know our our hospitals are for health care or St Francis they've they've really been a stepping up in so many ways I mean they they already provide a world class care\nOf but they've been very very involved in the community and they've been very uh\nCommitted to starting to offer those specialized a world class a care in in specialized centers\nAnd I was just over to Brett groundbreaking for St Francis and and uh recently for Hartford Hospital as well and for them to do that work but stay focused on this kind of a you know fundraising supportive of causes a great thing we should all be proud of that\nOne thing I'm Sorry go ahead no go ahead one one thing in a couple of minutes we have left to ... get your opinion what are you seeing and hearing about the new the new CD rail service in I live in walling front we avenue a\nStation they're new stations being build these lines the more frequent service now between New Haven all the way up through Hartford and into Springfield new casino up there wouldn't be heard and seen there how was that impacted the area\nYou know the word of mouth or has been phenomenal I I've I've heard great things about it uh you know I think we always was even more frequent service yeah but that the difference between what we've gotten our we had the Ford is huge and the fact that you can take a train from\nYou know New York or from southern part of the state and come up to Hartford without having to sit in Union Station New Haven for thirty minutes away for a transfer that's a big difference and the fact that you know you don't have\nTo say well if I go down I make missed the one train a day that's coming up and you can actually just looking at is done on a day now so it isn't a dozen trains yeah well if not more I was a dozen a day yeah yeah yeah no apparently love it and in each direction I think yeah and so you know that real service is really really important\nAnd I I personally believe if we were to do one thing to really change the game in this state other than you know as I always say we got to have vibrant cities but if we work to improve\nMy friends so you can call right now it's your appointment\nAnd get this done eight six six\nTwo three zero nine seven six three\nEight six six to three zero nine seven six three I had to call a last week a from a woman who wants to know how long does it take you to do this at at her home she was going to call you\nKnow the assessment takes brag about thirty minutes I'm no longer than an hour if there are causes for concern and we're recommendations to solve those concerns\nAnd there's a lot of questions from the homeowner I'm it would take about an hour but anywhere from thirty to sixty minutes not much more than that at all is relatively simple quick process\nAnd the folks listening out there right now you could also visit us on on the Web at smell busters with an ass smelled busters C. T. dot com and it can take a look at the overview of our brochure what we do\nUm you know it's it's you know very simple straightforward were removed the moisture kill the older causing bacteria from

management\nMy story begins with debt and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nWhen we protests yet which shouting out we have signed with what we think we'll get to the public and we are not saying we got to kill anybody\nOh we're going to cause anybody in a home that's a lot in the way that they're trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct some in what your thoughts on that [noise]\nWell my thoughts are this that\nPublic officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official but I think we all ought to set an example of civility and so for US Senator say get in their face\nFor congresswoman like her to say get in your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants that are surely\nThat is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong\nA I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate butter ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or congresswoman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps\nAnd ah and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic\nAnd representative government function properly or I got to be a\n... a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our but in your face is in a way to do\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nA and what does that mean let me she's at this I'm lesbian or gay elegy Beatty dinner\nAnd she goes in and take him out and she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take 'em out and telling people that are getting harassed and restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that\nSomeone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you pour all Susan Collins yet people being ... screen data senator from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean ...\n... what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in in public places and we're confronted with that\nAnd they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have but then you can't have police protection for four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well\nSo are are are\nI've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are a democracy will be a stronger or with respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or\nKamala Harris have to uh to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things is is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers and Minnesota I mean people are taking this old hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome way I could do it all is gonna you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help but so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibilities ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that guys they there\nGo ahead you wait a long time I think I started [laughter] Senator Grassley are\nThe lessons learned from this cabinet Tom saga\nOf many of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and and kicking off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations any thoughts\nTo solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings pass the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again [noise]\n... took me to tears called me pathetic for not calling for a whole bunch of but you can't you can't you can use if I called the vote today you on that we went along we we weren't all yeah tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here are doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the votes\nNow now I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the tweet because I said but I corrected myself and you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult and I think I'm a I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere\nAnd when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespect and I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said what if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicited some Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nUh well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because ah in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor\n[laughter] oh\nMy goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to um [noise] this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota undecided divide vote against Kavanaugh\nA lot of people have talked about whether the court remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator high cancer\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel vote in a way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the hassle when I've compromised um my true belief that um this person's um did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that the temperament issues Senator Grassley\n[noise] he lives and this gets back to what I already told you got twelve successful years on the uh the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land he's been collegial or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of a approach to judging and that means judicial temperament\nAnd not only are you have a personality that is a temperate you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh get facts of the gays and just to use those two things to go by so consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me\nTo a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record\nOf Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech I\nWant to say Hi Carolyn singers like language it\nYeah so so uh you know after twenty eight years of listening to the same thing about Thomas not seeing it\nI think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great prestige and knowledge and academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court ...\nCourt and it's all positive\nNo it's it's one of the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation in Maine of course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree with Susan Collins they got to look at her as a senator of great principal\nHi it's good parents and you know in my family's been in

All right a five five forty one room anytime jammed very quickly I Can't hear you saying that right then the whole Rite Aid five five forty Laura are coming up congressman Jim Jordan I bet he wants to document redacted or to do new things don't go away\n[noise]\n[noise]\nGuys have heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow you guys I used to wake up with a sore head I often have one of those critics in my neck you know it's like you can't turn your head one way and your neck hurts forget about it I don't have that anymore I didn't believe that my pillow was going to be so great until I tried\nBecause I Love that was really good one for the capsule I liked that congressman Jim Jordan also you know it may be because he's always on some serious topic but he has a great sense of humor as well Congress worry that you\n... um I mean I I'm like you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's been on this whole Russia or to advertise you but that was funny what do\nYou keep it at one of the ... which I like when he's upset is like one level it was like oh hey\n[laughter] I Love him he did a fantastic job and I mean I Would have been out here now I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had you had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein\nOr the other day down to where the heck with a sign of Florida yeah and I saw rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said when you drink some pick the dust on the president what'd you do you say your best friend's wedding what's the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and then you have to give it McCain memos that we subpoena there are all these stories out or earlier this week to talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually\nRecording the president in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording wherever they were going to do um and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rosenstein not going to show up tomorrow\nSo we don't do that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said that the law or is that the stories that said he said it's been okay and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker's show a book will or\nWill hopefully hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman Jordan explain James Baker the ah the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why his involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a that is important and when it's now now being reported that\nUh he was he talk to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein I never forget the fundamental fast\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct\nFBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times on roads fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to pay jeopardy I counseled demoted then left and of course Peter up\nThe counter intelligence demoted than fire top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein named Mr ... to take that investigation over\nSo that's why this is important that's on the road that needs to be in front of us so we can asking questions about all\nYeah he's not going to show up there's no way is kind of think you know I had my production think you're either no no he's he's not going to he's not going to come I I just\nI I guess I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and it maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired goad tape the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely lawyer you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance means that if this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department\nAnd whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set up particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spawn all this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and made Seventeen twenty Seventeen late night there's debate Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire calling me\nMay seventeenth is when Rosenstein names are lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAll the reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\n... ...

Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the\nChallenger running into is that we own to rental houses and we currently rent the one we live and then we don't want to take on more debt and they were trying to figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or um you know how to just sort of an NGO that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rentals worth\n[laughter] well one of the challenges that we face as the rental properties are actually out of town on them on the military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio rental properties or in Georgia and Virginia solving the value\nSell them yes I Would not long distance landlord okay\nNo that's your health and they were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a home and you need the money and they don't need to be alone you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these rental properties by default and it was not there you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all of the United states\n\nTo 'em that's been an inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my mom I haven't been seen though is that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um they seemed like there there's the possibility of it now you're going up\nAnd down under the values of go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their hardly all in your living room because

dollars and um\nWell I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of said I'm going to have been making about just talking the money but also investing to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way or what are your thoughts on that\nRight job right now so I'm not sure you're going to say\nWell as of right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred so out of my salary tried to say about twenty two to twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nA month correct for how long well the ... at the house I'm looking at I get a twenty percent on a down payment on a hundred and fifty call you about at least ten months there minimum that\nClear on that ... percent if I did a year should be able to get that it can include bonuses impact your turn him such\nOkay well twelve months will be thirty thousand bucks and if you invested thirty thousand dollars which you don't have the day but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay I'm now we don't have ... thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested and so if you make ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars\nMhm okay and so\nIf you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on a house or you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down\nOn the house doesn't matter much with all um Iraq\nThe point I was born as huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money\nUm is the secret sauce not the investment broker during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen

where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom sure\nNo problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to do the right thing and it was like you said about getting even

like no one else was very very cool\nTony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well I'm going to help I was\nCurious why you advocate a money market accounts are low you become or like are murky coupon\nCause your emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance\nOkay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid because if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it the right of return is irrelevant it's insurance they protects the things that does make you money\nTo see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible\nAnd they got to the set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out it's not liquid\nAnd then they they have an emergency you know what they do the bar owner four one K. long like a ... as you'd out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was liquid they got stuck\nThose are all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt treating it like it's insurance insurance is ... is an expense money tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense 'cause it sucks it's a horrible right of return it could be invested in making more\nBut that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is just sitting there\nJust as a barrier between you and the life and that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance

police really are and the left wing vermin lawyers and the way up to the police are actually\nThe ah the equivalent of the retroviruses that attack our own immune system and prevent diseases that are nations or under the surface to proliferate a I'm a student of epidemiology and I do know how it works and what our own defense sells the white cells\nAre attacked by a white cells that have been infected by a certain virus and then attacked the white cells themselves and start killing our immune system\nNow you understand who left wing lawyers are and what they do to our police who are our first line of defense against invaders by infecting the defense cells themselves including many police departments evident\nAgainst invaders by infecting the defense cells themselves including many police departments have been invaded by them Obama carefully made certain both our military\nAnd our police had been infected with these retroviruses called ultra liberals in law enforcement it's almost a misnomer how can you be an ultra liberal and be a law enforcement\nWhat does that mean you're going to selectively not enforce the law if you like the politics of those breaking the law is that what it means yes that's what it means to Eric Holder so now we are seeing the world when that was unleashed upon us by the Obama holder team up to ... we got a two for out of that okay so now we have a new president\nWhat can they actually do about this I'll tell you what's he's going to Mark Mark today down\nI told you that I Lived through the Vietnam War protest I saw the organizations and how they worked I saw the Chicago Seven trials\nI Know the whole story of the Abbey Hoffman's and the other Vernon I saw the operate I saw what they did to this country and now we have Bernie Sanders and others trying to recreate the very same thing\nBernie Sanders the communist Bernie Sanders the\n... of the devil and Carl Marx himself in my opinion trying to stir up a massive communist revolution in this country with millions upon millions of losers and drug addicted children who do not know history ... even knowing what they are doing following this pie piper\nWhat can the president do about it he can't do anything about it right now all we can do is try to spread the truth and try to explain the history and the background of what is going on before it's too late however if we cannot stop this from happening what will happen is the mobs will overreach and overextend themselves\nAnd what will happen unfortunately is what happened to Kent State university once again history will repeat itself in a very ugly matter biggest law and order once it breaks down breaks down across the lines\nAnd if the entire society crumbles that's the end of it for all of us our water supplies will go our food distribution supplies we'll do our gasoline supplies will go that's what and a key breeds go and look at Syria during a civil war\nAnd that is what they want Hillary Clinton said that she wants to civil war listen to our speech so if you all think that you're going to be immune from it because you wear a burning T shirt or you have a ... a poster on your wall you're wrong it will hit every\nLast one of your head as I said to before the guillotine once it starts falling is a very Thursday blade [noise]\nTake\nAnd he's entitled to speak his opinion until it results in violence at which point he has a committing a crime\nJust as in my opinion Maxine Waters has already crossed that line\nBy telling them off to go out an attack people in gas stations oh she didn't say attack she said make them unwelcome well they're making people feel unwelcome in the streets of Portland in Washington DC aren't they that's called a subtle way of saying go out and attack them\nAnd so far there's been no reaction we're all sitting here wondering when in the hell are we going to fight back\nWhen the hell is the tax paying middle class person white black Asian gay straight when are we going to fight back how we get a city like passes letting these mobs disrupt us in gas stations and restaurants in supermarkets and department stores\nOr are we going to fight back and how do we fight back well first we need the knowledge to fight back that's number one number two we need to know the law\nAnd number three we need to know how to defend ourselves within the confines of the law since we're living in a relatively low all this time\nThe hands of the police have been tied as I said you it started with a straight years of an artillery barrage from Morocco bomber and Eric Holder who attacked a police mercilessly eight straight years\nNot only that but they took every ... left wing lawyer they could find at NYU in Colombia and sent them out to every police department that they could get their little dirty hands into and put them in his so called monitors here in Oakland, California there's been a monitor\nWatching every move the very top\nAs a result this total advocate the police are afraid to do anything would you blame them that's exactly what holder and Obama wanted they wanted the gangs to run wild in the streets\nAnd so here we are trying to conduct lives go about our business be left alone but we can't they won't leave us alone in fact that's part of the dictates of the Communist Party usa they even scream as long as summer uncomfortable you will be uncomfortable and then\nThe dictates of the Communist Party usa they even scream as long as summer uncomfortable you will be uncomfortable and then they call you a white supremacist if you speak up to them things of that nature so what is your defense again\nI'm telling you right now including all of your pompous little liberals here in the San Francisco area who think that you're going to enjoy your shape pending says forever\nOr you left wing losers in the bay area I think you're above at all especially those of you over there on the Oakland Berkeley complex you think you could sit in ... near it everybody and go about your business that somehow even though you're worth of fortune through inheritance or through hard work or through luck\nThat you're going to continue enjoy yourself and that the mobs that you love and courage will only attack your political enemies you I'm mistaken you want mistaken because the guillotine is a two edged sword\nAnd as I said to you earlier and on and on and on and say proven mass hysteria which is a book even your liberals must read if you want to educate yourself as to a rational balanced middle road\nBecause it's a history book once the guillotine started to fall\nDuring the French Revolution and killed every revel accounts of revolutionary they could find\nThat shop to head off every counter revolutionary they could find\nThat the guillotine stopped falling no it was a Thursday blade a thirst for more blood and so what happened next is what happened then Castro's Cuba\nIs what happened and Bolshevik Russia it's what happens in communist China soon the guillotine was dropped on the enemies of the revolution with in the revolutionaries who started to fight with each other for power it was a pure power struggle then they started to kill each other\nBut again the blade was still thirsty\nYou understand what happens when a revolution as unleashed on a nation look at Syria how many years of this been going on that was a revolution that was a civil war has not ended yet has it if that's what you want in America over there and the shape and these cells of the East Bay that is what you're going to have\nAnd I call for a middle ground I called for calm\nThat doesn't mean power as it doesn't mean run from them in Maine stand up to them as I Do every day on this radio show you know a chance as I take doing this do you have any idea what chances I take both personally and commercially to speak to you\nWith the education the educated opinions that idea of you based on history based on politics based on fact you already idea what it takes to do this to navigate the waters I Am in the problem for us those of us are with disgusted by these liberal degenerates\nIs that we have a booming economy because the Trump and so people as long as their food on the table they'll look aside at the pornography on television and people will say what can you do the cities are filled with crime and violence and corruption we see it every day in the Senate and the house we know it's corrupt\nAnd ah although people the average person the sick of it\nAnd ... and the crime is out of control in many cities to take a look at San Francisco where just the other day a so called homeless bum beat up a young father with this child in a park and nothing was done to him nothing human feces in the streets\nNeedles in the streets nothing that people look the other way because the economy is good\nHowever listen to me carefully when and if\nWe have a blowout and the economy and I believe there is a win and in the upcoming\nThe parallels I've given you'll between the wind my republic of the into war years in Germany and modern America\nModern America\nBring about a fascism like you've never seen\nDo I want it absolutely not I Would try to argue against that I've tried to warn you on the radio finally I put it all together in my book stop mass hysteria will it become a big enough best seller like I said to the other day certain books have changed the course of society round I mentioned one the other day\n... Rachel Carson's book to Silent Spring in the sixties changed the whole world made us aware of the ecosystems that we're all living in that one book that title alone did it that was one of ... many along the way but um I forget the one that was done by Sinclair Lewis about meat packing in the meatpacking industry\nOr he wrote a book about the horrors of the Florida House that's changed things in America and brought about the pure food and drug laws of Nineteen fourteen I Believe books changed society the jungle the jungle thank you\nA single book and change the course of human history\nI'm hoping stop mass hysteria comes along just that the right time but I Am facing such a headwind of a slew of books by people who have television shows that have a round the clock publicity liberals promote their own conservatives do not because of uh\nBy people who have television shows that have a round the clock publicity liberals promote their own conservatives do not because of a outright competition they don't want to promote me but you are the audience can change America's destiny I'm telling you\nAnd you can do so by talking about history but first you have to learn a little bit about it and that little snippet I gave it today is only part of it the rest can be seen and stop or a mass hysteria I Want to conclude\nWith this if the economy blows down\nAnd there is real pain in this country that is when you're going to see the real right wing backlash\nYou will see it then you say it can happen now\nWell it is happening right now there's an undercurrent right now a ... on the current that people have had enough of this filth enough of this filth they can't take it anymore and it came to ahead with the Kavanaugh hearings when we saw when we saw the destruction of a very decent man\nYou know anyone that wants to college didn't drink\nBut yet we saw what they did to this man they stopped at nothing to destroy him and his family and that I think could be could be the apex of the of the uh the high watermark of liberalism\nI think it could be but the real flashpoint will happen when there is a major blowout in the stock market\nAnd the economy collapses that could happen suddenly than the American people will back a hundred percent strange and charismatic individuals who will offer it to save America and the worst is yet to come but candy economy collapse I'll be right back\nJoy those Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five for number seven to eight just average\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future call eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nDo you have sun spots in age spots well listen to Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sun spots director she says I Love the Gen yourself sunspots director is might go to product everyday watchers sunspots eight spots and even read inflamed patches vanish right\nBefore you very eyes and just like Renee if you click recall right now you'll get the gender so sunspot director absolutely free just for trying to sell\nFor bags and puffing is watch those stubborn sunspot Spanish now before you get busy with the holidays and those bags and puffing is gone and for results in less than twelve hours the genius so immediate effects is also yours for you heard me free again\nGo to John you sell dot com they'll call one eight hundred skin eight nine one eight hundred skin eight nine one one you order this week you'll receive Germany's luxury micro germ abrasion for instantly radiant baby soft skin on an hour and shipping is also free\nCalled eight hundred skin eight nine one or go to Jen your cell dot com you heard me right that's eight hundred skin eight nine one or January ... dot com\nAre you looking to senior care for your mom or dad they don't know where to start high I'm Down in London with a place for mom nobody knows your parent or a loved one better than you and nobody knows senior living better than the experts at a place for a mom have helped thousands of families find the right place for their mom or\nBut they are trained specialists offer solutions to return home owner causing bacteria mold fungi view sees and poor air quality even was advanced technologies in the world are proprietary active here technology is only started by faith acknowledging developed in conjunction with NASA\nIt's the most powerful errand service occasion technology ever discovered\nDon't mastery use other short cuts to hide ... today one eight six six zero nine seven six three were your memory and homes that men including our humidity and air quality tad San now one eight six six zero nine seven six three and the Arabs air it out of America's\nMost trusted financial expert each money talks for your real life on the Dave Ramsey show every weekday at noon on the talk of Connecticut W\nW ... am WBRC FM HD three Hartford W s n G ...

around the U.S did start making their way and some are already in place and save areas and they are staged\nA when the event is over then the the power companies from all around the country will then can for a converge on the affected areas to assist in bringing the power back so uh that that's a you know at least something\nOf a positive note that they try to get power back as quickly as possible but you are going on there I'll tell you right now that you're going to areas that are going to be without power potentially for weeks the other issue at hand here folks which uh\nUh I I'm sad to say that\nThere are people that chose not to evacuate ah the people that chose not to evacuate and in many cases that we're looking at a category to or you know\nTouching him to carry category three but here we have a storm that intensified to a category for our strong for right on the precipice of becoming a category five hurricane\nAnd the issue at play here is the intensity forecasting is where the weather professionals lack they'll they'll tell you hey as forest storm track our history you look at all the different models us models the u._k. model all the satellite data\nThey're getting pretty good in fact I mean their target area here was was pretty damn close now it is easier when you're a hurricane forms in the Gulf of Mexico and\nIt is literally days away from striking it's different than when you're trying to project yeah you know ten days or two weeks out as a hurricane is barreling across the Atlantic and then into the southern Caribbean\nAnd in the ... on to the east coast to the u._s. or into the Gulf of Mexico affecting Texas Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Florida et cetera so you know obviously being closer to the forecasting\nAs far as track is going to be better however they are getting and they have been pretty good track it intensity over whether pros all the meteorologist will tell you that it's the intensity forecasting which is lacking\nSo it was a category two maybe it was going to be a three that may have predicted a three of landfall and here we are almost a category five\nSo how many people stay because the intensity forecasting there's an all I can handle it to be able to three the fact that there was a forecast for free all yesterday\nI I mean that's the only major that's considered a major hurricane a category three but then a juiced up even more with the fact that it was just a couple of miles shy of a category five\nUp right of land for\nA couple of hours ago or weren't eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the

hoping to even take the Senate there's something important I'll tell you about that next [noise]\n\nMine number ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three\nPeople for poor police anything close to the restaurant\nHas been very visible he will be very visible he is in the past gotten very good marks or for some of the natural disasters in tropical activity in hurricane to the state of Florida during his a two term tenure as Florida governor however let me be very clear here\nWhat could make or break a governor Rick Scott in his quest to take this scene away from the Democrat Bill Nelson\nIn Florida for the U.S Senate or is going to be I think viewed through the lens of how the aftermath of this hurricane goes listen we're we're a month shy here of the midterm elections\nWe're right around a month shy so Rick Scott as governor of Florida is going to be judged and he's going to be put under an extreme microscope right now and this could be the make or break\nSo the way the state of Florida under the direction of Governor Scott handles the aftermath of this hurricane I think is going to have an amazing impact on whether ... and the polling has been a pretty close to the sewage doing once the latest a\nA real clear politics average getting given the latest on the uh Bill Nelson and the Rick Scott race and listen this has national implications because of the Democrats pushing to not only take back the house but they want to take back the Senate\nAnd they don't think that it's completely out of the question butter Rick Scott winning and taking that seat away from a Democrat\nOr that certainly helps Republicans retain\nThe the US Senate and I'm telling you right now that the way the Rick Scott the way the state of Florida responds now is going to be very significant and could be the make or break for Rick Scott\nWinning that Senate seat and putting it in Republican hands and taking it away\nFrom Democrat Bill Nelson [noise] so ah let's all watch this now some of the video on this storm some of the video that are starting to make its way out\nI I've seen video now of a commercial business roof being killed off in the video was taken from what appears to be a high rise or a hotel or along Panama City beach and a a a lower\nUh for uh from from Ohio for that's where the video was taken from a you know all of the the the commercial building adjacent to this hotel or or condo high rise or someone took video out of the window and you can see a ... the roof of this uh this business or commercial building completely peel off\nThere is other video of some beachfront homes\nBeing destroyed I mean ripped apart along Panama City beach and\nThat is to the west you know twenty twenty five miles to the northwest or west northwest of we're landfall was you know around\nThe Mexico beach area and of course the worst part of a hurricane is on that front right quadrant or the ...\nThe Mexico beach area and of course the worst part of a hurricane is on that front right quadrant or the north eastern side that's the worst and here we have\nTo the to the west to the west we have\nA you know a lot of the structure is being ripped apart along Panama City beach so you know just to understand the destruction as hurricane Michael is a\nA category for now we're sitting here for forty two eastern time and the hurricane is the only category for as the eye is completely overland now to the north west of Tallahassee\nBut either I'm walking and video again along Panama City beach and there are structures that have been completely ripped apart it looks like some ah\nSome structures that were actually under construction have been ripped apart and the other thing folks\nI a lot of people get injured and there are fatalities in the aftermath it's not just the storm surge uh people uh you know killed by a wall of water or ground or what ...\nAnd not only on the wind damage and and the collapse obviously we in the Carolinas that we're in North Carolina we have the it was a north and South Carolina we have the awful during Florence the awful story of the mother and the infant killed when a tree fell down to the father was pinned and I thought they were going to have to amputate his legs\nOn the spot to get him out\nAs his wife and infant child were were killed\nUh so yeah it's water it's it's the storm surge it certainly is the potential from a flying debris during the wind but in the aftermath folks I'm gonna tell you right now\nWe're going to get the reports of deaths afterward people dying from electrocution from downed power lines\nOr they're going to be injuries with chainsaws you're going to be in a potential death with people and chainsaw as they're trying to take the limbs down and remove trees from roadways you're going to have a bunch of you know warriors out they would change the laws that are they going to have a you know a snap\nBack on a chainsaw and that's happened where people die so even after the storm has done some of the most dangerous times are in the cleanup and the immediate aftermath\nSo I sincerely hope that people take extreme caution or by the way she was telling me that in the state of Florida that the Democrat Bill Nelson according to the real clear politics average\nBill Nelson the Democrat is up two point four points in the composite of all the polling right now over governor Rick Scott and of course a two point four points is totally within the statistical margin of error and\nAnd and all ... and and they're all there are also a couple of recent polls that might not be part of the average but the point I'm trying to make is is that the Governor Scott needs to really kicked butt in the aftermath with a less than a month until the midterms are they need to really do an amazing job\nAnd he knows this trust his political team absolutely knows his [noise]\nHere we we don't need anyone dying and nursing homes at this point we need to make sure that the emergency response in the state of Florida in all of these affected areas is swift and very effective but some of the video clips of extreme flooding and storm surge water\nUp to rule vis\nA upped the second stories now in some of these areas or it's going to be a hell of a clean up and it's going to be quite some time folks\nUh yes I Will be the later tonight or certainly tomorrow ... until we have a real full assessment\nOf how much damage or this storm has created we have a clip that has been released by ABC News of this upcoming special of Tommy yum as a in\nAfrica and interviewing the first lady\nMillennia Trump and millennia address well the cabin on confirmation battle and the me too movement and less I'll tell you right now that she was absolutely spot on with first lady Melania Trump telling ABC's Tom ...\nAnd he does the weekend anchoring on ABC world news tonight and then he's also a reporter national correspondent during the week or so millennia Trump told Tom yum is that she supports women\nThey should be heard but well I'll let you hear the audio this is the the audio or from the interview you'll even hear the question I asked\nHear the audio this is the the audio or from the interview you'll even hear the question I asked by Tommy on us so I Want to play a role to play a little chunk care so let's see if we if we've got the uh the audio rent n roll yeah my uh what what was it\nWas not talk about it they know who they are I don't I don't want to put them out in front of the world's eyes so here and come here and how wide\nWide ranging interview we also asked the first lady about some of the major events that have shaped and walked her husband's White House and the country including the me too movement here we\nGo to give his son I really I think I've had many false accusations\nChoose last week her husband's sharing that sentiment as the FBI investigated judge Brett Kavanaugh over an accusation of highschool sexual assault\nWhat is your take about the me too movement though do you believe in them do you support the me too movement\nI support the re men and they need to be said we need to support them and you know all the men not just the men\nDo you think that and then in the news that I've been ...\nAre now here's the money shot must have\nHad been treated unfairly any to have a really high that he does that you know that if you're ... or something so that evidence\nSomeone in my view that and say how could you say that this is from you need to stand with women\nThan men but we need to we need to sell the evidence he could not to say to somebody I was you know sex and the phone that tight\nSo what's wrong with that now millennia from the first lady she's already being attacked for them is that oh and you even heard Tom ... like a you know you're going to be accused of outstanding what what is wrong with yeah a sexual assault any type of a sexual impropriety or activity against women\nHorn it it's it's awful but it can't just be a flippant accusation you need proof it's you know it's it's ... it's innocent until proven guilty not the other way around",
