di do six that should be required to show a general link to one registered on it\nAnd the doors role is available to be research so either family would be there or not\nAdditionally a family tree to great\nGrandparents is required to I'm not sure whether she means Delaware tribe or Delaware Nation can we get her to delineate that you know those are two different prizes or you know the Delaware Nation they require one eighth Indian blood and a family tree with birth\nAnd death certificates going back to great grandparents Delaware tribe of Indians requires a CD R B and a family tree going back to great great grandparents are more of a lineage both Cherokee tribe and do a nation seemed only require the provable lineage\nSo I you know again [noise] I mean you have the Cherokee Nation

it's a Monday folks there's so much stuff to cover I spent a lot of time on the list with Warren a senator warning hours one and two because the stories just fascinating\nAnd the question I asked if you're just tuning in I asked her only with the calls should Trump be required to pay the million dollars to her favorite charity if she could prove any Indian descent and now she's a demanding the

much is shored\nThat the Republican Party will add seats exactly I see it at fifty fifty I see it about fifty four fifty five they'll have young but in the house because it's so wide spread all over the country it depends on the individual candidates\nHow much money they have a much charisma they have how they frame their message so national commentators like me the very hard to evaluate that um it's a ball in every precinct and um the wild card a lot is money\nAnd when you add the progressive left a lead by George Soros pumping big money and digging rational campaigns around the country that's a big advantage for the left and that's happening\nBecause you know that if they hang on to the Senate or even get a stronger hold him but lose the house than an awful lot of the Trump agenda which I'm In favor of simply stops doesn't it\n[noise] yes and that's what happened to block Obama and his second year\nUh he lost a majority in both houses so he couldn't get anything done so where did he do he did executive orders and that's what President Trump will do things on a bevy of ... of executive orders to get his agenda\nFlowing so he's assured ah being competitive in two thousand twenty so if the Democrats take the house or you'll see a lot of executive orders in two thousand Nineteen large\nWell that's going to put a lot of us conservatives in a tough spot because I think there is a place for executive orders a very limited place but I think most things should be done through a legislation if you want to change the law you don't do DACA because that's clearly something that should have gone through the Congress you\nYou but ... Obama wouldn't do it that way or the other thing though and let me ask you about this and then we'll get to the book and that is in the nineties when ... when Clinton saw that his agenda was not going\nUh well he he did some course correction and said this isn't working for us we need to do a few things differently that will the left to be smart enough to do that as they see that these tactics are not working to their to their advantage\nYou see ... ... it's a it's an excellent question you're asking but I see it a little bit differently I don't think there is a left in America anymore either I think there is a progressive far left you know\nThat has allied with their um enablers in the media and who has crushed\nLiberal people crush them so\nYou're not seeing moderate Democrats say a word there was a recent study done it says eight percent of Americans large are far less people\nBut that's what you hear you hear Bernie Sanders you hear a canal Arabs here Cory Booker ... have been warn\nYou don't want to hear the moderates on the Democratic side and they are afraid\nOf the far left\nThe moderate Democrats are are afraid because they know the far left as the media megaphone and so there really isn't a well will laugh learned its lesson because the far left will never stop\nThey want to fundamentally different America\nAnd the moderate labs afraid of them so they're just gonna keep not saying anything how many Democrats large did you hear stick up for the presumption of innocence and due process and the Kavanaugh situation\nI actually can't think of a single one that did and I think I Would\nRather not and I researched it I researched it\nI says and the Kavanaugh Sichuan I actually can't think of a single one that did not I think I Would say they're not\nAnd I researched it I researched it I uh I had my staff find me a Democrat and elected Democrat that sticking up for the presumption of innocence in America now you know there are plenty of them but they wouldn't say it\nBecause they're afraid of meat to they're afraid of a Soros they're afraid of humor and so they say nothing\nMost talking about killing you\nHave and I think independent Americans are getting that maybe they're not getting it the way I laid out for you but they're saying you know there's something wrong and I think that'll show up in three weeks and I ... I I Do\nBelieve I Hope you're right let's talk about killing the says the hunt for the worst war criminal history\nOkay um the book is about evil\nAnd I wrote the book off killing Patton which is a fantastic success and thank you for pointing out that\nThe killing series though this is the eighth one the first seven have Seventeen million copies in print the most successful non fiction book series of all time in the first six days out killing the ss old a hundred and forty thousand copies\nSo does something going on here and wanting to garden I write history in a way that is compelling you can't put the book down and we've always done that but ... says about evil and my contention is that Americans many\nOf us don't understand truly evil we don't we look away from it so a guy walks into a high school he shoots down a dozen kids kills 'em thousands of people are shot\nIn the city of Chicago by drug gangs clerics molest children those are all evil acts you know but many\nOf us are going to look away well as just on the news they don't understand it there's evil all around them\nAnd perhaps the most evil people ever walked the earth were Hitler's henchmen B. S. S. who were in the concentration camps and we tell their story how many of them got away because people like the red cross the American CIA elements of the Catholic Church help them\nDo you think the Boston Globe who's in her corner the originally reported that it was one five twelve of the foreign and then they had to issue a correction today and says you said it's it may not be one five twelve to maybe one one thousand and twenty fourth\nI'm ... why are they willing to play along with this game when they know that as you pointed out for employment law and EEOC you know equal Employment Opportunity commission\nThat none of this stuff even matters because it wouldn't hold up for those standards which are the standards of government a government that you may want to you know someday be president of the government\nThat's right the Boston Globe dating back to two thousand and twelve has essentially served\nAs Elizabeth Warren's press off as they did this back into two thousand and twelve what she does is she gives them exclusive access to family members exclusive access to documents and they run with her story line and they did it back in two thousand\nAnd twelve and they've done it multiple times in the last three to four months as she's getting ready to run so with the Boston Globe didn't do here is what a responsible news organization would do they would've first of all review her actual\nDNA gate and not just their report someone she hired concluded they would have taken that data to another genealogist to another scientists familiar with DNA and whatever verified this person's funding there is no indication they did that they simply took off the shelf\nA report she commissioned and she obtained which even on its face is almost laughable that she might be one one thousand\nNative American based on a DNA database\nWhich doesn't even include Native Americans and that this is is really preposterous and the and the issue becomes why did she do this and we know the reason she did it she didn't claimed to be Native American when she was a child she didn't claim to be Native American when she applied to college or law school it was only\nIn her mid to late thirties when she was climbing the law professor ladder\nAmerican lung she applied to college or law school it was only\nIn her mid to late thirties when she was climbing into law professor ladder from University of Texas\nAll the way up to Harvard law school that she listed herself as being Native American it was known she listed herself for EEOC filing purposes that way and lo and behold when she finally get tenure at Harvard law school essentially the top run on the ladder\nYou can't go any higher than that\nUh she stopped supporting herself as Native Americans\nAnd who should get high right there at that point well now do you see this creating a real problem for her because as much as I think she's been a punchline nachos for conservatives but even for the president of the United states um and now\nHaving dumped this additional piece of data as though well I can show there's one one thousand but now you have to believe me\nIt almost seems to me that there's going to make her more of a punch line there ... folk tourists are just humid Donald Trump would promised a million dollars if you could prove to his Native American ought to send one one thousand and twenty fourth of a million dollars to Elizabeth Warren and say OK bet settled\nAnd the Cherokee Nation issued a statement late today complaining and lambaste in car and saying quote Senator Warren\nIs undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage closed quote and they then go on to say that you cannot use DNA as a test it's demeaning to Native Americans\nThere's a lot more to tribal membership in tribal inclusion than DNA\nAnd the DNA is totally inappropriate to use for their purposes and they don't use it and so what she has done is she has created to thin she thought she was going to settle this problem instead she made herself laughing stock and two she is actually\nForced Native American and this is the unofficial tribal statement from the Cherokee Nation saying that she is undermining their interest by or continue\nContinued claims of tribal heritage so I think she made her situation a lot worse than it was the question I've always had for her which is we know what happened here she tried to chi chi try to rig the system for herself why doesn't she just apologize what is the personality\nProblem that she has that she will not simply apologize and I get a lot of her supporters like her policies okay it's kind of left wing politics and they're willing to excuse the but very few people I Believe actually\nBelieve her when she says these things that may be willing to use it but if they like or politics but I don't think anybody believes her and I think what she doesn't realize is people are laughing at\nHer not with her and what she has done here which is ludicrous DNA test she should have come out and said I had my DNA tested it's such a miniscule fraction at at you know one one thousand\nYou know I really never should have claimed it I didn't know this before but now I Do apologize to the Cherokee people into other Native American it would have created a little bluster for a week or two but you know what it would have served in much better you know people have to ask why won't she just apologize\nAnd it's got to be an ego problem because professor Jacobson from a legal interaction you know William [noise]\nAmericans in amazingly forgiving gun free one I've seen politicians have the guts to actually apologize she won't do it and sadly I think she's going to pay for thank you very much for the

be with you on a Monday and I'm Glad to take your phone calls and your\nEmails Grover Norquist joins me now who's president of Americans for tax reform and I don't think anybody likes paying taxes but I pay when I'm legally required to pay\nGrover won't surprise you that some of my listeners have been paying way too much attention to the New York times story about Donald Trump and his taxes and how much the state of his father pay in taxes because apparently a daddy Trump managed to figure out ways to ah the the IRS\nSigned off on that we're a legitimate way to transfer of wealth from him self to his kids can can you fault him for something like that [noise]\n[noise] absolutely not for starters Seventy percent of Americans for decades as a supported the idea of polishing the death tax\nThat it's an unfair attack they pay taxes several times you pay taxes when you say that are just stupid enough to die they want to take half so this is a tax most Americans have wanted to get right up for a long time the Republicans came close to getting out of it under Trump is still there\nAre a little bit uh\nBut when outrages me is that somebody in the IRS leak this you know uh you know somebody's tax structure I I'm kinda concerned that if we trust the Iraq with our personal data that air attacks as that for political reasons that might get\nShared a not quite sure what\nThe ... when that happens politically remember a Nixon after he lost a Kennedy was audited for the next eight years you know and\nBoth Obama and Clinton politicized the IRS I served on the condition or to look at the IRS during the Clinton years I was a Republican appointee and uh I heard many conservative groups heritage foundation's citizens against government\nWaste other groups were harassed by the IRS I talked to my left of center friends to see if you know maybe they're going after all the the larger group stuff none of the left groups were a hit by that and I asked the head of the IRS who testified before our commission or as congressional presidential commission and\nI said look a\nMy conservative friends are being harassed and gone after for no reason to them out on the left this is not happening what's going on they said no we've got to bury even handed a way we look at it as I said well explain it to us and they said no it's a secret you're\nNot really\nThat was yeah that really you'll have to try a and then a carry the then senator from Nebraska said okay we've really exhausted the subject of this is talk about something else gives the Democrats out of there\nYou know I Know ... we've exhausted at all I in fact Grover I've told people on the air listeners they'll say well why didn't ... released his tax returns I said you know there are people who would sooner share their home address with you\nOr their cell phone number or the email address than they would tell you how much they make what their paycheck is and to know somebody's taxes you'd have\nTo end up knowing not only how much they make but how much they take home and what they deduct like Hillary Clinton famously deducting charitable donations of her husband bills\nUnderwear and things like that um bloods talking about something a little more serious there is an analysis that you've done is president of Americans for tax reform about who actually pays the taxes and I think this may surprise a few people um who does pay the bulk of America's taxes right now\nWell on income taxes about three percent pay the top fifty percent um it's the top fifty percent pay almost a hundred percent of the income tax or it's extremely progressive uh and uh the number of people\nWho are paying the taxes are shrinking ah number now all Americans pay some taxes that's why a lower income people they they're particularly badly hit by cigarette taxes their taxes property taxes\nSales taxes so nobody nobody goes to your life on skate\nIt really badly hit by cigarette taxes their taxes property taxes\nSales taxes and nobody nobody goes to your life on skate the Democrats think they can tell people I'm going to make other people pay for it lower income people are smarter than that they know that heavy taxes they pay\nAnd if they think about it they know that when the grocery store pay property taxes they pay for it when they buy eggs and knock at the at the grocery store or\nThe grocery store doesn't have any money it doesn't get customers\nAnd every tax dollar that a grocery store pays in property taxes are in sales taxes in a income taxes to their workers that all come straight out of the customers a pocket so everybody gets hit but the idea that the rich are paying\nAnything and they could pay more we actually I was just looking at church today the United states has the most progressive\nOverall tax structure of all the major uh companies countries more than Europe you know all the countries should think of as very socialist and so on ours is very scared and we ought to be reducing taxes on everyone instead of playing this game about\nYou know a person seems to have all ten fingers let's take one how about you know not worrying about how everybody's doing just let's get taxes lower on everyone\n... room for it you know nobody would run their own life for this way when I see the numbers you have the the top fifty percent of taxpayers the top income earners paying Ninety seven percent of the bill and the other half pay three percent I I tell people imagined\nYou go to dinner with ten family members and one night you decided to do something different you say let's have all the people at this table all you know cousins or nephews or uncles or whatever will seat the five highest paycheck folks at one end of of a long table and we'll put together five people at the other end of the table\nAnd then when the bill comes if the bill I don't think you can feed you know ten people for a hundred dollars but let's say you could just make the map easy when bill comes for a hundred dollars the people of the rich under the table paying Ninety seven dollars and the other five people at the other end to pay three bucks can you imagine\nDoing that to your family one night how long would it take for probably ... at least one end of the the wealthier end to object to that kind of arrangement\n... ... since the one of the things that's very important to the leftist to constantly say that a higher income people middle income people aren't paying their fair share as as big as data that you can think that somebody is the government can get more money for free out of nowhere\nA instead of understanding that that a higher income people pay a great deal of taxes as it is um because the tax code is complicated and because they're trying to squeeze more and more money at it like to hide how much it's hitting you and where\nAre there are problems and that it's too complicated we should go to a lower and simpler tax structure uh I grew up in Massachusetts where flat rate 'em as it's five and a quarter a flat rate income tax in very liberal blue Democrat Massachusetts\nThe idea that we should have been graduated a progressive income tax which Carl Marx lights at night yeah I'm not sure I get a in Massachusetts five times the left has put on the ballot let's go to a progressive her graduate income tax like the federal one and five times Massachusetts says voted it down\nBecause they realize that if you divide the taxpayers into different groups and they each pay different rates they'll get bogged wanted at times seven\nOne year they'll get a lower income people are raised in the middle and upper and the back and forth adult constantly be changing but always up for it you know but if it's a flat tax than the Kennedy kids and your neighbors could all go don't raise anybody's taxes\nI think that's a great way to go Grover Norquist is president of Americans are transferred from reform Grover thanks for the time by the way\nYou know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes you knew what he was smart zip recruiter dot com slash Laura's unlike other job sites zipper cutter doesn't wait for the candidates to find you zip recruiter finds them for you it's powerful managing\nOr what I think it's remarkable is at the experts told us that this was the new normal that this one to one and a half percent annual growth was what we were going to have to be resigned to live with is a little tour western advanced economy and then along comes Trump and up it was amazing to me\nAfter the resigned to live with is a little tour western advanced economy\nAnd then along comes Trump end up ... what's amazing to me it is it wasn't even just the new policy the deregulation of cutting of red tape and eventually the tax cut it was the expectation that no longer would you have the federal government\nPiling on regulation upon regulation on American business things like the clean Power Plan and so you see this manufacturing boom\nStart this very moment that Trump won election in November of two thousand sixteen because the economy the business people knew that it was going to be a different day or a and I believe that to your point\nHad these policies been pursued earlier we would have a much larger and more vibrant economy today\nYou know it's funny I'm Talking attractive or who's vice president of the national of national initiative for the Texas Public policy foundation all of that Keynesian economics gee if we just pile a bunch of money out there and we'll prime the pump and get the engine of the economy going again\nDoes the folks who push those kinds of policies now see that they didn't work that having all that cheap money out there didn't mean anything if somebody wasn't taking advantage of it and the reason they weren't taking advantage of it is that they had the expectation that they're going to have more regulations and limitations piled on top of them and the minute\nTrump came into office as you say business began to react\nSo there were folks out there in the economy who knew the moment he was elected the this was going to be the result and yet all the reporters who covered the race did not seem to know which kind of suggests to a disconnect on on factual information\nThat apparently the reporters you know we're so focused on the election they didn't go out and say to businesses actually gets in what's gonna happen\nInstead they heard the scare headlines that you know Wall Street was gonna go upside down that the economy was going to go into a giant depression that all these bad things were I Would have happened and they were all Parenthood in these stories while apparently all the business owners knew he gets in a we're going to be off to the races\nI think you're correct it isn't just the recorders I mean there's people like Paul Krugman the New York times who is supposedly an economist he\nWas filled with a forecast of doom and gloom because of President Trump's election and we see the opposite you know I don't think a lot of people are going to come out with a vehicle opened it meant that they all along they have too much invested this is about a world view you think that the federal government\nIs equipped to tell us how to live our lives to tell business how to operate a layer of regulation of on regulation written by an elected bureaucrats\nOr do we think that liberty that freedom that that ... unleashing the dynamism that is the American\nEconomy and ingenuity do we think that the better way to go and if you think the latter if you think that freedom is really the the answer a then you're going to come up with a completely different a solution than someone who thinks that centralized

they're making very healthy incomes those people lost a decade\nAnd by the time we came out of it that particular group had no way to recover there was no way to say well now it's almost Seventy I'll go out and get that job back\nLike the one I had a decade ago when the economy went to ... seven or no way and I'll I'll make up all the ground I missed out on because there isn't the time left in their lives to do it and and they're not going to find anybody interested so those people got cheated and if Obama with a recovered economy by June of ... said okay\nWe're going to make sure we come out of this thing fast\nAnd and do that but but he wasn't willing to do that or and neither one of the people around him\nNot at all but let's look on the positive side of the think of the young

McNally the executive director of free our Internet\n... good to have you back on the program Oh thank you for having me so what does Google think about the possibility of legislation being written that might affect the way they operate\nYou know I I I don't eat the um\nI think there it it kind of a cue faith thing with them um I think they say one thing when they\nAre up at uh the hill and they kind of a fight or legislation and then we have this new Lee documentary called that the good sense there um and it talked about how do they want to basically turn the Internet\nAnd American to a European a utopia so [laughter] um I\nI think they're talking on both sides their mouth and um I think people like you and I and to other people who watch the speech to keep their um each of the fire\nYou know it's interesting that as a search engine uh I I Wonder if people understand that senior groups have been trying to bring to people's attention and that is that by slightly changing the search results you can create an entirely different reaction\nBy people to all kinds of things news developments and that sort of thing\nUm there was an example of bit over this past weekend I was looking for some stories that I knew existed from a short while ago a couple of years ago where a man had been confronted by a group of antifa need pulled a gun to protect himself and then he was prosecuted for doing that\nAnd I know the guy's name or I Know from covering the story and I know how it's spelled and I I put it in and nothing popped up about those stories and I thought I Know there there\nSo I put the name unquote marks and again it didn't pop up because it was an example where I made it actually been prosecuted for\nEngaging in self defense and I thought I'm Wondering if this is part of their new algorithm where I put in you know Mike Strickland which is the guy's name and then I put in gun and then I put in charge or convicted I knew he was convicted and he was sentenced to some time in jail\nAnd the stories weren't popping up at all and I thought I wondered how I mean I was using Google is a search engine but\nIt's the some time in jail and the stories weren't popping up at all and I thought I\nWondered how I mean I was using Google is a search engine but if you if you change things just to ... you can make it appear to somebody\nThat certain stories just don't even exist even though these are in mainstream big newspapers and it was covered pretty extensively at the time do you think I'm running into some of those new censorship where they're trying to uh to make\nYou know make the European uh paradise you talked about\nAs well and and that's not actually and it's not a new thing that they're doing I'm back right after the Parkland incidence of for at least twenty four hours if you\nPut in a word that had the sequence G. U. N. so like right near where I live there's been stopped you know New Hampshire and a gun and roses\nOr any guns and roses and didn't exist\nAnd put them into government wow\nYeah so they like with that sequence of gee you and if the word had that sequence in it it could not be found a goal so it is not something that is new I think the um\nOur jet people like you and I have been talking about it for such a long time now people are starting to notice it and with this document you know that was with a lease last week people are starting to become aware I'm you know we've been\nBeing Tulsa the past two years it's a conspiracy theory there's nothing to this the algorithm as a computer you know ... we're not doing this on purpose well clearly\nThis document shows that they want to be quote unquote the good censor for you know the we're going to abandon free speech for safety and civility\nRowan and how do you increase civility if you're the immediate aftermath of something terrible happening you know a plane crashes and so you say I Wonder what the history of plane crashes is associated with that airline you might go in and put in you know plane crash\nAnd and the name of an airline if they say well we don't want to bother people you know so we're going we're just going to censor those results you don't really need to know about plane crashes or somebody is poisoned with you know strict nine or ... and with arsenic and so you put in arsenic poisonings and nothing pops up\nHow does that make them more civil what is even their argument for how that makes them more civil society when you say whatever it is people are asking\nAbout right now I don't tell them they can ask about it in a week\nWell my the bigger question is who are they to decide to self a point\nAnd I guess they're straight ahead answer which is a tough one for me to answer is there a private company\n... they're not a government so they can engage in any censorship they want to technically legally just like checked I couldn't decide to take a phone call from a listener or I can decide I don't want to take the phone call from a listener\nNobody can force me to do that or forced me to talk about something or not talk about something they could say we're no different from the new our laws\nAnd so it's a tough one for me to beat\nExcept by maybe shaming them by saying why are you denying people access to the information if you want to be the index to the Internet of all things\nWell I think I think here's where where we might have them because in this document that they actually talk about being a publisher um and um how they get you know right now they they get around you know the whole censorship thing because of um you know some certain legislation that\nYou know they allows them to um ... if they can act without a you know that they they don't have the liability right\nSometimes you know the the ... communications deeds decency act um but if they want to start considering themselves that publisher um and they can start doing that kind of thing um then we can definitely um start kind of more than put putting their feet to fire\nThe other argument that I have an even I have gone over this a couple of times um where they control Ninety six percent of you know the search engine um Kmart or to you know\nI I mean I I Love you ours and I know a lot of people listen to you you don't have Ninety six percent\nMarket share are rich or you don't control\nI mean they're literally controlling what people see and I mean and it is but let me let's let's talk about China I mean they are willing to completely put an alternate Internet\nIn China than in government can dwell government government controlled in quotes but they're willing to sell their souls for the almighty dollar to get into China and you know China is a as a as a rigid regimes they're going to go in there they're going to bend the Internet and\nYou get into China and China as a as a as a rigid reading they're going to go in there they're going to put in the Internet and they're going to let the government tell them what those people can see and what they can spend\nIf they're willing to do it in that context why wouldn't they do it with us and and they're and\nThey're willing to do it with us because they they have a view of how it should be anyway you know and and and the crisis in my argument as\nThey talk about how bad the United states you know they get up there on their little soap boxes and they say you know the United states is you know massage mistake and were horrible to minorities and all this stuff and the reason why we have to you know do this\nIs because people are being ... fold and they're being bullied and and um you know America is just a pool and I'm sitting here thinking okay you're willing to work with the Chinese government\nWell and and the thing about this how did that even work it doesn't work\nCrews to leave my now is executive director for your Internet I think about this goes to a I look things up because I was taught by my dad always look things up imagine\nFive six years from now I'm writing an essay about women who've told lies\nAbout alleged sexual misdeeds and I think what was the name of that Ford lady what was her full name where was she a college professor because maybe I've blissfully forgotten about you know about to crispy Boise a cushy forward and\nWhat what rules they wrote for the most part\nBecause even when we see a cabinet secretary who heads a BPA are heads up ... heads up some other agency\nThe person who actually writes the rule maybe six or eight levels below that person and when that person makes a changing the rules on I don't know how section eight housing is regulated and you know in theory this the cabinet secretary above and the president above the cabinet secretary responsible for it but it was actually written by a\nCivil service lifer who can't be fired am I wrong\nYeah now you are not long at all um the amazing fact is that in the last twenty five years in every year\nThe federal government's administered agencies and regulatory agencies have put out three thousand rules wild and that's over a hundred thousand rules over the last twenty five years now that having\nThat hasn't been that that much legislation that would require all these rules so what we have is these agencies using legislation that was made years ago\nTo write new rules now\nAnd the question is how would they really empowered by Congress many years ago to be writing the rules that they're writing today and that's one of the things that I think the the court system the judiciary has to look into and stuff\nWell let me let me try one example\nI knew there was a law or there was a an a\nA rule called title nine and as I remember the the essential purpose of it was we got all these schools public schools and colleges that have sports programs that are mostly aimed at benefiting young men uh football basketball baseball Gulf whatever\nAnd that you know young ladies were not getting the opportunities you write a rule and in general people sit down it's probably fair if you're gonna have a football team you should probably have\nThe equivalent so that a young ladies can get some opportunities as well not a bad thought but ... and and not bad in practice until you find out a couple of decades later by the way it's going to regulate which bathrooms\nAre used by transgender individuals in communities and you don't have anything to say about it because Obama crafts\nA letter of guidance or his department of education does and all of a sudden you're you're ... your your daughter comes home and says hey there is a boy who is using the lady the girls restroom now at school well how'd that happen a lot of something to do a title nine\nWhile I thought that was about sports no it's been used to rewrite the bathrooms is that a good example where where they take in a union is used it\nThat is an excellent example and something even more pervasive in the bathroom rule that is part of that and although you're\nEntirely correct that what what Congress authorized was for any school that accept federal money it has to make have a educational resources available\nOr without a correction or without any connection to sex that is women should have the same educational resources is meant what has happened to that now is that\nConnection to sex that is women should have the same educational resources is meant what has happened to that now is that that legislation has been turned into a question of sexual harassment at ... although it was\nIt was directed at schools schools are the ones who that was supposed to comply all of a sudden as a result of that language the education department has created a whole system for sexual harassment of student to student\nUm and so not only what sexual harassment is but then what the punishment should be and how the person who is accused of sexual harassment should be tried none of that would ever had been considered by Congress back\nWindows that statute was passed in Nineteen Seventy two well how about you know that's the kind of problem we're facing\nOkay we've got about a minute but Peter let me throw an idea that you saw all these I don't expect that when they write the federal fish and wildlife law that says federal fish and wildlife has to write regulations you know pursuing to regulating you know fish and game you\nKnow the federal level you hand out to the agency I don't want to I don't want them I don't want Congress writing and duck seasons starts on August fifteenth and ends on\nA holdout administrative detail does need to be dealt with somewhere but if you said\nAt some point within a year or two all those rules have to come back pass Congress and Congress has to say yeah that's right that's what we intended for you to do they can write the details but then Congress has to say yes and when we knew because we'd be alerted\nThis is coming before the Congress as crazy ruled that they wrote on section eight or ADA or or or or sex or title nine is coming back up for a vote if they don't vote to approve of the rules simply goes away\nDo you think that kind of thing in ten seconds would actually\nMake a train [noise] it wasn't that could change the Congress is just too busy to do with all these ...\nMember I said three thousand regulations and so for those to be which are all detail because as you pointed out these into detail he's not the major subjects and the rules but just the

Davis radio program on there because they had at Fort seventies talk of Connecticut\nCongressman John Larson is with us as wanting right here live in the studio and a again a downer bags are called to the congressman and knew that I wanted to do something on Social Security\nAnd uh he is the mad tigers when good morning good morning great to see a good morning good morning Brad great to see you as well again this this whole Social Security sits right and that's why we want to hear\nAnd ah and some other news site I Can't believe some of this stuff and it's not going to pass I Hope some of it\nWell yes ... what precipitated um the you know I'm not a digitally fluent and some are you probably are more than I Am but ah [noise]\nI was with Billy the auto and he said our staff came up to us they said\nYou know your whole message on Social Security it just went viral and they said again I said what they said you went viral Billy Seattle said you better go see a physician [laughter]\nAnd uh but what happened is we went to the floor of because the Republicans were introducing a balanced budget amendment now everybody favors balancing the budget you all want to make sure you're doing it the right way and you've got to get can span which you don't have a meeting your needs\nBut in this case the way they were balancing the budget immediately after they had already let the horse out of the barn was a to point three trillion dollar tax cut\nMost of which went to the wealthiest one percent are unpaid for and created this enormous debt so after they let the horse out of the barn and then say now we're going to close it and we do have to get a control on spending so we're going to introduce a balanced budget amendment\nWhich will automatically cut entitlements\nNow they say like Social Security well yes but Social Security is not an entitlement course and that's why I went to the floor and I said new slash\nSocial Security is not an entitlement is the insurance that people have paid for all their lives now it may not be actually a really sound but that's the fault of the United States Congress not the people who have been paying into this program that has never missed a payment\nAnd all we need to do is strengthen this program\nAnd the cowardice of this act is that if you passed a balanced budget act if it ever went into effect\nThose cuts would take place automatically without the Congress ever having to vote on it uh so um it's not going to pass it on the Senate and ah it was um uh I think they realize that they had open Pandora's box here\nThey like to think that when you say a title is people are gonna think you're talking about welfare reform yeah instead they were talking about Social Security Medicare and Medicaid many Republican governors including John Case that guy my dad has stood up and said wait a minute we cannot\nCut Medicaid because of the help that it provides for the poorest amongst us\nCertainly we can't have further cuts to Medicare especially those that are that are automatic and Social Security is the bellwether program for the nation we need to strengthen\nSocial Security not cut it in for so many of your listeners in so many women in America who find themselves in this situation the average amount of money that they receive from Social Security annually\nFourteen thousand dollars annually and for more than fifty percent of them who were survivors or living by themselves they live in poverty they live below the poverty level and work in a God these programs I have\nTo give President Trump credit here when he was debating sixteen other Republicans they tried to box him in trapped him on this old\nAre well what are you going to do are you going to raise the age you are you going to cut the benefits what are you going to do to Social Security how are you going to cut it and Medicare how are you going to save these ... are you going to cut these programs he said I'm not going to cut these programs these people have worked hard for this they've paid into the programs\nI'm going to strengthen the program I'm not going to cut it and that was in the midst\nPresidential debate is why bread in many respects you carry the elderly with Israel so uh he I think is inclined to go along with us ah we feel confident that we're going to take the majority back in November and when we do Social Security will be top on\nOur list of priorities to win an act for the American people\nAlong with infrastructure improvements but Social Security needs to be expanded we like to see across the board increase of two percent follow what the Arab ... foreign saying making sure that the Cole is the senior receives\nFollowed their actual expenses medical hospital doctors visits medicines that they need heating and cooling their home\nGehring team that the cola will keep pace with the medical changes that are going on and make sure that we're not taxing people who are still working [noise]\nUh but uh on their Social Security payments you know if you are single and make more than twenty four thousand dollars your Social Security is taxed if you're a married couple and make more than\nThirty two thousand is taxed we're going to end that and we're going to pay for it we're not going to raise the debt at all it's going to be paid for in two ways by scrapping the cap\nOn people that aren't over four hundred thousand dollars that's six tenths of one percent of the American people\nAnd also by saying the new contribution is going to be an additional ... percent by all American citizens\nOne percent paid by the individual one percent pay by the employer now the employer gets a tax write off for that and the American citizen gets the best benefit that the country has a Ninety nine percent loss ratio that has never missed a payment\nAnd covers not only your pension but if something should happen to you unfortunately if you die you get spousal and the pending coverage there's disability coverage\nYou cannot buy this anywhere on the open market uh that would have a price that would be affordable there is no such product like this the companies would sell\nThe full faith and credit of the American people and that's why\nI was so riled up on the floor and why this message as a resonated all across the nation and\nAgain and again the president of the ... states ah he stepped right in there\nHe stepped in long before he stepped in when he was on him\nAnd they put the full pressure on him and they asked him well how are you going to cut Social Security how you're going to cut Medicare what are you going to do do you agree that we ought to raise the age or limit the benefits at the end of life\nHe said right then in front of his opponents no you're wrong about that these people have worked hard for this money and we need to strengthen these programs dot cut them\nIf any of you have a question on Social Security or any of this or that we're talking about this morning please feel free to call us one eight eight eight five seven four to seven to three is our\nTelephone number if ah again you have any questions about social Social Security so again a a a congressman and when you talk about this uh again this is something that they are concerned about in Washington\nVote very much we already have on our bill a hundred and Ninety One co sponsors of the bill that takes two hundred and Eighteen to pass when there's only a hundred and Ninety three Democrats but many Republicans have come up to me and said you know we really like your bill\nBut our leadership has said we don't want us they don't want us to sign on to this bill so uh that's been very disheartening but I Know the people are going to pass the the\nKind of attention that this is getting Brad the absolute need that we have here uh for what is the best program in the country here something every American should realize and you'll appreciate this\nTen thousand ten\nThousand baby boomers day\nEligible for Social Security you cannot ignore the adjustments that we have to make that this plan we have to step up we cannot burden a future generation and in fact we want a guarantee for them as this program done as the only one that's a ... a Social Security actuary has said\nAnd bread I asked is everywhere I go as anyone's insurance policies gone up since Nineteen eighty three\nI exactly as a in a homeowner's as your automobile has your life for disability or health care insurance have they gone up of course they have because they have to keep actually a really a pace with what the cost of living are and what what it costs to actually producing that is not the case\nSecurity it was not properly index when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill last tried this\nIt's so they tried to do it together and they die remember that exactly they did do it together they fixed it but they did what happened is the Congress did not index it at the same time had they indexed the program we wouldn't be having this conversation because of the program would be\nSufficient beyond is Seventy five year requirement and it will be able to make these payouts we'd still be asking to enhance the program but it would have more\nThan enough money to do this [noise] the problem is that when the Republicans want to believe this on the other side by not fully funding it or lead an artificial budget balanced budget amendment sequester\nFunds automatically without a vote a that's a dangerous concept\nFor everyone a as bill the long term goal and out of all Republicans slowly being clear about that there is an ideological group there that just simply believes that these aren't necessary necessary programs unfortunately they\nHappened to be controlled by their leadership at this time but when we take back the house of representatives\nSocial Security is going to pass and as we acknowledge I think the president is in line with us on\nThat as well he's already said\nHey thank you for the call\nAnd thank you for the opportunity\nNow let's go to Jim in Windsor Jim good morning good Bonnie\nHardly have your mind congressmen a jumble why get rave review the issue of people on Social Security disability a vast majority that are on disability deserve it they have every right to it\nBut as time has gone by and the last Thirty years I don't have they said they fix every sure you're off as bad as the percentage of paint on disability for Kerry has grown by leaps and bounds and when you were a young man and bread\nWith a young man the average person would never consider going on disability if they weren't really deserve their disability but the social norms ever change and ah\nI I Would like I I Would suggest that we I don't know what the right amount of years are uh periodically or there was a review of people that are on disability\nAnd and if we could clean up some of the way I think we could increase the amount of money that some people deserving lately disability could get more and overall would make the Social Security program stronger I'm gonna hang up and listen to your Turner thank you congressman\nA lot of what you you have to say is it is true but let's let's talk about this and I'm In a broad sense first anytime there's fraud abuse or ways with and government you have to go after this\nSocial Security is one of the most successful programs in the country it has what would be the envy of any insurance company in Ninety nine percent\nLoss ratio by any standard that's pretty good but not a not even a small percentage of waste when you're\nDealing with every single American citizen the\nSmallest percentage has a lot of money or there isn't a and I was glad that you pointed out because people often say there's massive fraud and abuse and disability or there isn't a but there are problems within the program Sam Johnson and I just am one of them are also happens\nTo to deal with what we call last pace or people that become the uh the takeover and\nUh they become the executed or of Social Security for people that are disabled or people that are close to ... we have to step up and make sure we've done and we just passed\nA bill that does that that eliminates the has\nYes working with Sam Johnson a Republican from Texas and myself we put this together and working with a lot of communities more going out to one of those agencies that it's going to receive the money to monitor the abuse but they're also is another phenomena that's taken place I think you'll appreciate this we'd been a\nContinuous wars since two thousand and on and so many of our troops that are coming back in individuals who have post traumatic\nStress and the capability of people looking at mental disorders and\nAnxiety that has come through ... who is what is ravaging the country and the opiate epidemic has\nEnormous stress on people so it's not just simply have some that have taken advantage of the system and to those says that's why we need to make sure that the program is solvent so that you have\nThe case workers who go out and track\nHim make sure that no one penny is going to someone who doesn't deserve\nA fast buck ...

[noise]\nIn their genetic makeup I forgot exactly how much but it's you know point zero zero you know it can be traced there\nIt turns out that according to these um according to the task that she talk apparently that she's touting I'll see if I can come up with the exact number but\nApparently according to this test [noise] um the amount of even though it's it's it's microscopic it's fractional for everybody on the amount\nOf you know Native American DNA that she's touting in her lineage now is apparently according to the New York times like half\nOf what it would be for a regular you know Caucasian\nNorth American or or American habit and so that's why the Democrats\nAre looking at Elizabeth Warren ... going to run for president by the way but that's why they're looking at are gone all for God's sake what are you doing stop stop taking the bait see the thing about President Trump forget whether you like them or not\nHe's he's a master at bathing people he is he's a master at bailing people and there's such as seizing hatred for this guy on on the left in among Democrats and even for some on that right\nYou know he there's such as seeding hatred that he knows\nPeople people talking about how dumb Trump it no no no no no no no he might not be a policy wonk he might not be you know and ... then the two or three feet of documents for every policy but he's got interesting instincts and he brings from his business background\nAnd what I've noticed over the past\nTwo years or so is that he he's a master\nAt being able to bay people and then when he gets a response from somebody he's a master sitting there with you know with the palms open to the hands go and see I I you know\nA unit you folks didn't believe me but I told you and you know there are people on the left it among Democrats who say you know to their credit who say you know you know don't fall for this you know he's he's he's he's playing you\nLike your Stradivarius here what are you doing but yet there are certain people who can just get baited into doing this\nAt all is about Warren's one of them Maxine Waters is another one that they'll just keep rolling their mouths as I'm sitting there going what are you doing I don't have the base but listen you know see because [noise]\n... Republican presidents in the immediate pass\nIt even further back they've never done this [noise] [noise] see Trump punches back\nHe lands some early jabs interview combat\nHim it's he and his DNA no pun intended but he's used to kind of guy that's not going to sit around\nYou know like previous presidents and the Republican side of even Democrats who say well you know he should have more presidential he doesn't do presidential he doesn't now he's been a bit better with the way they get everything over the past couple of months probably because they see some of the uh\nSome of the pre election polls that we're starting to break a little more toward the GOP so you know maybe somebody's getting to them but the current president the current occupant of the oval office he doesn't do presidential [noise]\nNow how that's going to reflect in the midterms coming up and in twenty twenty when he assume superbly runs for re election I don't know ... ... ...\nYou know as I said to a friend of mine the other day who has worked in Washington and\nWho has been and they you know diplomatic corps and who has been ensconced in some of these people who are undoubtedly summer never Trump or his you know we both agreed that\nHe is re written the book here\nOn campaigning and also more importantly and don't tell me the other side is watching as he is also rewritten the book I'm communicating with the base because it's all about Twitter and I understand a lot of folks aren't on Twitter I'm much more of a Facebook guy but\nKnow going into this governor cycle everybody was sitting around going all the outrage we're going to get a Republican back and\nYou are and how you're going to do that [noise] how are you going to do that\nBecause it's ... it's about demographics people you have to understand that it's about men verses women it's wide versus black ... black versus Latino what's Latino versus why and when I say versus I don't mean an adversarial a sense here\nBut the demographics dictate politics you got to understand\nThat [noise] and that's what\nCost a lot of people especially here in Connecticut now the cities are so blue they are so deeply steeped in blue\nAnd some of the suburban areas that I can remember a generation or a generation and a half ago outside of areas like Hartford in New haven in Bridgeport in\nStamford Norwalk a New London you know some of those areas that were purple or even read because conservatives left the cities they didn't like the decay they were seeing you know some of those areas that were winnow bowl for Republicans a generation to generation and a half\nAgo you know even they're gone [noise] because you have to understand\nAnd I've talked about this all the time one of the best folks and I've had him on this radio station a couple of times there is a guy that follows the trends in politics from a from a from a statistical point of view\nBut um [noise] especially from a migration or a movement point of view Sean trendy and trendy writes for the or at least last log cabin read anything from a recently\nBut the trendy a writes for the um site real clear politics dot com\nAnd he's he's really simplified to a major factor goes it's all about migration he said the reason that that that the Democrats get frustrated\nAs to why Republicans and conservatives you know still can get sizable wins in the country and it and and and the reason that\nYou know Republicans and conservatives no they can in certain areas of the country it's because of migration because you\nHave a lot of folks who are Democrat or center left to lean Democrat at once they grow up in the suburbs they tend to leave those suburbs and migrate towards cities and make the general area around cities heavily heavily\nBlue and by doing that if you do the old theory of edition by subtraction\nThat means that when they blew voter or you know concentrations of blue voters leaves suburbs what happens to those suburbs not only nationally but here in Connecticut\nSome of those suburbs become even deeper and deeper and deeper on the red or conservative side [noise] so that's what you're you know senior year in Connecticut you still have\nThere are enough you know suburban voters around here that can still make at least at this point\nThe ah the ah\nState Senate an even split the you know what Eighteen Eighteen split and can still you know leave the state house within what ten twelve votes of of of of being tighter or of a a Republican majority even though the Democrats still hold the majority but once you get to the big cities Hartford\nBridgeport New Haven New London Stanford Norwalk when you need to call those big votes to win statewide elections or even to win a constitutional seat it's almost impossible unless you have\nIn the future some major demographic shift because when you look at the fiscal disaster that we're now and\nAfter two rounds of the amyloid ministry ration you would think it would be a home run to elect a Republican governor ... but it's not [noise] six forty three Seventeen beef for seven o'clock ball selling on the bread Davis radio program will be back\nHi

of those things that that I have my friends in the community always saying you know the best social program as a job to get a burgeoning a black and minority economy going in these cities which will you know spam development and growth and and the lifting up of some of these areas again\nThat's right I'm at that's where the black this lines has been effective um we we did a couple of things to make sure that\nWe can enable that a first is that we went into the community and we made sure that we understood exactly what some of their tenements are so even though we did talk about the the history behind where there were certain\nA thriving community but overall there has been on struggles because there's built in impediments in constraints sometimes in some of these systems\nAnd so you we want to make sure that folks are aware that there is an organization like ours that's there to help them get back\nAt economic empowerment and then more so as well it's that awareness around that so many times and you have okay these constraints but other times it's about do you know that this is here you know that this is there for you\nUm we we leverage not only our relationships within the community but our partnership so for instance next event I'm Dan Barry is going to be\nYou know where we're going to be hosting a workshop that's going to talk about not only access to capital and how to get funds to the state of Connecticut going to talk to them how to put their business plan together we're partnering with the ... the local as the D. C. and the local chamber of commerce so we are strengthening\nUm our our our numbers were strengthening um our force within the community by making sure that those types of organizations\nThat also have ties to the business community can help us make sure that we continue this work that we're doing great\nOr we're going to hang on for just assemblymen of ease the gas from the black business alliances the bread Davis radio program all silly infrared this morning seven forty five let's see what the traffic's doing\nTalk of Connecticut Bouvier insurance traffic\nI eighty four was found in Holland between exits sixty nine an exit sixty eight has stop and go driving back to exit Seventy following the overnight tractor trailer fire you start for stopping traffic route Jew was bound exit for Jew exit Jew stop and go on eighty four was bound to fifty\nSix to eight forty seven also wrote Jew was bound exit age ... and ...

coming from the state little um if they're perhaps\nIs a black or minority business owner or an entrepreneur listening to us right now is saying you know what that's exactly what I Need I'm having a rough time with the banks are with maybe my business partners or I just don't have the cash I Need and what would you say to them right now\nI Would say that there's programs out there for you if you're a woman if you're an African American regardless you're going to have\nA way of getting funds into your business they can access um this program if they go to the ... business alliance dot org website at our website and if they go under a tab called the MBR alas\nProgram so it's a and B R A L F which stands for minority business revolving loan fun they're going to see the link to the application and they're going to be able to um get going with the process\nWould you say that there isn't as I Know probably ... no no no two cases are alike but is there an an average time a ballpark from the time they may hear you now and log on to go look at that too actually getting the capitalists at a several month process six months a year no not\nThat long all good and that is part of the reason why a black business alliances expanded our services this upcoming year that's what's new um we not only are making folks aware about this program but we're also making sure that they can get the access by partnering with them and giving them the technical assistance\nSo it's not a slog there'll be waiting years it'll be it'll be about two months to down three\nUs um and I I Do say this caviar here because it's to be you know just upfront and Frank about things different too yeah yeah but it's ... business owners want to go right so we want to make sure that folks are we're not only the program but here's what you need to do here is how you can get help\nHowever we don't produce the company's financial statement or not they got to come along so that's the one that's the one thing and sometimes the process can take long as ... as a ministry and if we get it\nBut we want to make sure that hey you could turn around and go on line right now and you start that process so we we do make sure that we provide them all the assistance and support they need to make sure they can move along with the process it can be as short as two months that can be as long as six months\nAnd again if you're asking for money I don't care whether it's from a private bankers investment firm or from the state you have to be prepared that's\nRight that's right but we we make sure that we we aligned them with all the support that they need 'em and if there is any gaps you know sometimes some folks for instance they start their business but they didn't have a business plan that's OK still comes through you're still eligible if you've been in business for a year do you have less than a hundred employees\nAnd where you needed right that's exactly right that's right that's\nAll right you're

I Hope you'll agree with me that you know I don't think and I have\nFriends of mine who are teachers public private parochial charter school all over the gamut I Know a lot of teachers and and I really think it's it's too bad that there's not I I Know some schools do a decent job and I think we need as much if not more music\nTaught among the arts in school because you know hitting kids that young age from grade school on up through high school you know you're going to hit those one or two or three kids in every school who are really going to become great musicians and I really I'm really passionate about uh about music being exposed to kids\nI'm Glad to hear you say that and I I work here I started a thing here called speak up which is a\nAn open my um where you can do whatever you want as long as you keep it within a certain timeframe lives no there's no real rules here and so it's been really successful with ten years running now\nAnd it's it was designed to reach the people in the community that are hard to reach kids who have who are homeless and kids who have [noise] you know parents\nHave drug problems and all that we have a lot of that going on here where I live and so it's been really success for someone to talk to them to teachers a little bit about the structure that we created that was able to draw these kids off the fringes in into the\nInto a some sense of community and help them find their voice so that's that's where the primary reason why I'm going down there\nAnd then I'm going to talk to the school um the the ban students um about my career path

greed\nAnd my um [noise] uh the only other side it's Irish so it's not like a stunning cultural diversity but in terms of well you you may know like in the fifties when they got married it was really difficult to as were\nThe two churches didn't like each other then my grandfather wouldn't go to the wedding and all of that so the two cultures are really different and so um it's affected me a lot of it I feel\nI feel like I have two people inside of me when I'm up there like the the Greek Siamese very emotional and very um [noise] uh coming from the heart of kind of you know a one they want to hug you and put their hands on you and all of that and and then the Irish side is more of that sort of quick wit and not really that big on Hogan [laughter]\nYeah no I Know what you mean you know I

trying to figure out how to do it before I realized how hard\nIt was and that he was just making it look easy 'cause he was so good at it that was a bucket list moment for me to be able to say that to

ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell none of this will shockey law but I Am following the state law that we have in Georgia for a verification process because we believe that we should do not support this that we should bear of a new individuals are before we register to vote that's why we have a stick\nOr a citizenship ... this is why we have when you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand four team reelection of governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout\nOf Donald Trump was elected in Georgia the most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that

will have so much winning that you may get bored wondering\nCouldn't happen to a nicer guy Michael ... who\nIs forever on TV\nGiving this really an analysis about how he's going to take the president down\nAnd how Stormy Daniels holds the key\nTo what did he holds a key don't teacher Michael or what is it all the K to [noise]\nAs she was just used by him I mean uh\nThat's going to be a lot of uh\nWork that Stormy Daniels who's going to have to do to pay that off you have to pay the legal fees to the president [noise] he has pretty pricey attorneys I don't think ... getting paid anytime soon Vanity Fair by the way as a piece that Michael Cohen has provided key assistance to\nA number of investigations that are ongoing or I'm not going to spend a lot of time focusing on that but I I Do find it very interesting that\nThey spent very little time on the Stormy Daniels a story on other networks we were so top heavy on the show last night on ... we didn't even have time to get into this we were so swamped with all the immigration news and all the other stuff happening in the midterms in the\nParty of victimhood angle do we have the party of victimhood angle on the website ... yes it's on ... dot com and Facebook yes okay so you can watch my\nMonologue if you missed it last night all also you have to make sure your DVR the show so you can watch it a lot of people watch it when they get up in the morning I prefer you watch it live that's always better watch it live a but if you can't for some reason make sure you've DVR and uh the anger mango at night\nAlthough we were so swamped with topics last night we didn't even have a chance to get into the Stormy Daniels but the judge ordered legal fees paid it was thinking about this just as this unfolded kind of last night as we're getting ready for the show\nThe plaintiffs bar\nIn the United states the lawsuit mania Trump should talk about that too not just because of his own personal issue like if you're well known person or if you run a business you run a store you know the slip and fall cases it is an outrage that\n... and he had council\n[noise]\nCall Laura now one eight five five forty Laura\nBecause\n\nThere is this faction in the White House in in the house of representatives that is just trying so hard to make the final weeks of the election of a referendum on hardline immigration policy hard time uh breaking through with that message in a big way has not been\nThe defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this sense and you see it was hard liners as a sort of regular feature American politics now that they feel like if we're more outrageous we do something that's as more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a rather I\nNew York times\nOr because he really is in touch with people on immigration\nRight it's not a big issue [noise] let me give you some facts here before we get to our guests are the Gallup poll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us voters was back in July\nTwenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and is the highest percentage naming that issue in Gallup history and asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question\nUh again mentions of immigration as the nation's most important problem have\nAveraged only five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking the question\nOn generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration is their biggest concern\nTopping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers ... was the top issue for voters in the election or that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters\nCiting immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same\nUh but listen to this forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community now why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that\nBecause of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime a housing ... goes on and on ... ... these are the facts\nDonald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration than pretty much any politician alive today he understands that ...\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia ... congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongressman I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nEvery time we passed the omnibus bill or some massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep his promises on securing the border your lead and bunker where the\nGentleman that I use the term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explained to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done\nIs said if you don't want to open borders than your me ...\n... and the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand\nThe very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all were robust and help the legal immigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and\nWhy is that the Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on securing our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nGoes wild and let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAnd and and that just goes wild and let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox ah this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear a categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so\nA bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a his demo a democratic uh in uh North Carolina both acted\nTo remove that from the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took\nThey they've decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\n[noise] well look Kevin Yoder\nAnd Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always thinking moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection I disagree dance with the one who rung you um and and so you you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's list right that's a joke I'm\nBut I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nThe upside you know the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhen I said maybe we'll get some some courage right you see you see we're McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now I I I fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out the voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless All right I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\n... air and Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught and ultimately release because we do not have\nThe facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\n[noise] well a lot of prosecuting for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge upon any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove ... Israel Salvador ... well that is why they're saying we're feared alien abduction but that doesn't mean that that it's actually happening\nYou know well again I think that's you and you seemed you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people are like we we got cities with with the homeless a villages tent villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who\nNever were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted we need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ... we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that you take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with ... with rage about the situation\nA congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV though and we'll take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action don't go I\n[noise]\n... here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nOkay uh uh this uh this weekend I spoke to an end to affirmative action Raleigh would ever bloomed he's the president of students\nStill considerations period of it\nUh uh this uh this weekend I spoke at an end to affirmative action Rawley with Edward Blum he's the president of students for fair admissions which is suing Harvard uh basically diversity has become a justification for racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites at Harvard\nAccording to Harvard zone admissions data or they reduced Asian American enrollment for forty three percent to Eighteen percent\nUh through a complicated ... a diverse if a\nDiscrimination scheme I in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nAre an internal to include they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury their board that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is that\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell I Am so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be swimming in money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism a title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored\nRacism um and it it she has a huge impact on its missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the\nBelief that diversity is the founding principal of America a is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity as a founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be as Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I kind of this is the point I Want to do this to the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out you see it leads the school that doesn't practice affirmative action\nIn admissions and I learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education you just\nLet people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know ... year merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically\nSubjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states ... vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class\nOf Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a ... letting field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nNow well ah this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nThe lawsuit is not about protecting Asian American men is brought\nAn anti civil rights act of that scene where well a white rights activists who has been trying to bring down marrying someone writes accents in American society town and ultimately about his gall to bring down as as the mountainous and that is\nActually designed to increase the INS increase opportunities increase there are the make education better for everyone which is good for Asian Americans as well\nUh your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard class\nShows that it is much harder\nGet into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard class like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nUh lose an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America\nWho got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those beagles spoke at the Asian American coalition\nOffer education's Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Hartford\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as\nRacism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action or so because we have this powerful ... who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nOr going to be in business is probably going to go on for some time\nOn the federal district court level then to a court of appeals and ah if they determine the circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating are we going to get you on TV you gotta come on TV with us soon a v J and I'm now his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this the the it's racial been counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society\nA and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others are instead of just respect for talent in individual merit aid five five forty Laura

you put the fifty grand down on the new home or\nPay off something dumb that we did and that is the thirty one thousand dollar car loan and ...\n... I Would sell the car [laughter] you build a car okay [laughter] I thought that's what you might say I'm okay what's your hospital in\nA one hundred and\nBought a hundred and sixty five thousand\n... right so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation of home went there so clearly okay let's say that we pay off the car with this money and then loses twenty thousand dollars put down our house and if you remember the exact same house you're talking about buying earlier\nI'm a centrally you have financed your car on your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nUm [noise] that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse okay that's where that's how I got there so quickly because ... basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years which I'm not going to do whatever obviously\nWhat ... what a refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car not a million years\n[laughter] you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here and sometimes if you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you\nAs we continue in our conversation here and sometimes if you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the

electric utility company\nVery cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of debt was the one hundred and forty thousand dollars\nOh I'll answer this question because all of it was mine\nYeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to good old Sally may say wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened to me well how about your story\nWhere we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year for giving this program and I actually heard you come across the radio um I was driving around in my work truck and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong though and we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it oh which is locked up yeah yeah it was it was\nI mean she's a follower and she was really do I have some leadership [laughter]\n\nShe's out into our word she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually\nAfter I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the the program and everything I should we just need to um instead of yelling at me we need to go through financial peas and then you can hear a guy from the source right from days and then you can eat whatever it takes on my back exactly\nLike yo yo yo the video guy\nYeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the numbers you know because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the clash coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nSure I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had beat it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden 'cause it was all mind yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah ... and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity\nTo truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic when you first started you I mean I Do do do it this fast\nWe a lot of debt and twenty I it was a long yeah it was hard we started the ... the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was ... it was hard to years and four months running and\nYeah and that's what that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty

kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing ... and I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction panels quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of dead\nPeople started to come around then when you look at somebody go already paid off a hundred thousand dollars come shuts 'em up absolutely yeah\nYeah it's like you don't have to shut up and just says it it's good yeah that's great very cool you guys very very well done what is the key to getting out of debt\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all the also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked every time I bet on and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that and honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad\nBecause that was money that would be knocking on my ... now mhm\nThey gave you gave your boundaries on a process yeah what about you oh I think the the the\n[noise] I\nIt it was it was it was good I mean we we we weren't where it was a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt do you think to work\nExtra hours or if the if you raise your income over fifty thousand dollars Courtney finished a residency program that is huge for her I'm sure she got a big raising them\nYou know I Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatch at the utility company and just uh the extra income any chance he could get extra overtime home do it you know it it really helps the snowball just\nPlow through and go to the finish line you know there was something about that because you're getting traction if he was working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you you just be exhausted but it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning\nAbsolutely deny it changes everything and now you can crank back down to a normal people hours now and not have to be so crazy

consider earn income or capital gains\nAlso aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income uh that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income and it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right\nIf the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old\nThat will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. where it's never yet been taxed it'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not rough it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out\nAll of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been\nOrdinary income as it comes out um all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the\nReturns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act\nOn a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those if you have investments simply invested in these real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own investments like a mutual fund\nOr a low turnover mutual fund he'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if you've held it over a year so that helps

talk about with them we actually ah put those on the counter than we put them on the task lesson you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and

up well I'm excited that uh you know you and they were glad my wife and I\nUm how are you I'm Dave how are you today that are than I deserve what's up\nWell I'm excited that uh you know you and view of lead my wife and I on a on a clear path to a much better situation not that we were in a really rough spot but it feels a lot better being where we are now him in um [noise] we are a very quickly approaching the end of baby step three in January will be\nSix months bluff and so my ah my focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and going through the class is actually more than one [laughter] and um\nWhen I'm really faced with is our house and they moved in and two thousand six and a we pay two fifty to a according to the low and you know casual conversation we're not we're not at the two fifty two so after you know twelve plus years were not back to our original ... you know purchase price [noise]\nUm that's weird\nYeah it no you know Phoenix got hit really hard by the housing bubble and\nWe ... really hard I'm Sorry I'm In a lot of\nPeople even across the street or are you know have doubled the price of the house they bought a couple of years after we did we bought on the right side on the downside of the top but we're still not back there even or you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others but [noise] um so we're not there yet\nAs we approach four or five and six steps for five and six I'm you know I have two teenage sons are going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our a retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning [laughter] and so now I'm just trying to figure out if we just\nForget the house would not put anything where they're eyeing\nDown or in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously so the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's by beast of war period\nUnless you're in an emergency situation you you do that now I'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking down the barrel gun on college and so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while\nThat Dave Ramsey dot com\n\n\nRamsey solution sunny from San Diego California drop by and ah ... Hi\nMiss around leap us fall it's such a great honor to speak to you um\nAnd my question is I'm just immigrated to the United states and you know and I've lived a frugal life\nUm like say my money the capital within ... but sometime arrived in the United states I'm I'm On my some of my clients was telling me\nI'm that you'll frugal living will make your social loud cost you ... if you'd done by next awards and expensive cars and all of a status symbol of the um you will be treated as a social loud Austin I'm came to understand what would be your take on that\n[laughter] I Love it\nOr the jury murder I brought a United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old are twenty nine okay and how long does you're living in ... eleven years were you a social outcasts there are no for the\nOil or where did you live in the u._k. ah for the call off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice with a a word legitimacy and you weren't a social are just there for being frugal no but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nOh there and it was just [laughter] you might ... as they are now are getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have\nCommon sense as well so um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with India or the one you ran with an ... for sure uh because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider your social outcasts for having good common sense values now a that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth\n... well over ten million dollars is buildings worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks I'm problem is I don't care what you think\nAnd that's my watch a pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks I'm problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool because I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I hunt mhm um I read somewhere that um\nBecause this country guarantee freedoms to all people to Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a re signed the pledge of allegiance and\nThat just got hold of me I was about twelve years old mhm and if I Do a apply that in my school and then give\nIt a naive I was ... um didn't realize the American constitution doesn't apply in India [laughter] and I actually got um the piece of floored me out and got in trouble yeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact of the principal one day when I make it to the United states you won't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom at is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not a law okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought\nThrough you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom at a right to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or where are not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um the very people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character\nAnd um the uh ... and ... the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your your your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you decide billing you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character and aren't judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you're driving a car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't that doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have and and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that a hopeful part of this year is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living I'm looking I date in IT or do what do you do a a developer they're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to national work Roche [laughter]\nSaudi as an honor to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon thanks for stopping by open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five ... this is the Dave Ramsey show ... is with us in Atlanta id how are you\nA high I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up [noise] um I had to ask if I should pay my taxes from here and she reported on information um on our Seventeen taxes and other without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charged ten thousand dollars in penalties\nYeah mhm not taxes I Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay I mean it sounds like a percentage on the information mhm well that\nFalse information sheet allied yeah intentionally and you can prove that\nYeah why would you do as I get to get my money I don't know but I think that she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying a card that we don't\nAnd yet to get them back more money I don't know like when she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claimed that we were at home I'm from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird I mean does your husband have something to do with this when he doesn't have heat that we can you know I mean that just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have an cars you don't have enough knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have a church but you know trickle down get huh so there was no there is nothing in um [noise] the documentation and into anything about the church you know they use our uh our number I Believe that by but when the number of any of them\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one ... see three as of venture list that you're being paid uh outside of the church\nNow you know you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side of everything is through the church or a hundred percent\n... and even for they charge me now make any money for that tried to get his own and we both work independently through another company\nMostly you about your by vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I don't I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing as someone would do this just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you've signed the tax returns though\nDidn't [noise] I Know everything they've you know you know but you had to see the tax returns you you you didn't allow someone to send in tax returns it either see Shirley and I you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and ask them\nA hot and my guess is the most you could hope to get back will be the penalties and the taxes you already oh and you still owe the penalties are due to him not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know that some attorney\n\nA went into my office got on the computer and started making a spreadsheet and I sat down and the first thing I looked at was the car um it was the only vehicle you other than the tractor that we owed money on still ... um we had my mini van was paid off um had he might many fans now well over two hundred\nThousand miles um wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happen to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas when he handle yeah you know and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do the by Dr ... and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get to buy back and got the cash settlement and got rid of the payment and the position that would put a than it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd thought about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back from what I've been doing and he said he would buy us FDU 'em\nFor Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of was in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pets but not today or to talk to him and I was a little nervous 'cause the car was kind of cats and I didn't think he'd\nGo any man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the media but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most and I told them about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\n... um and I I thought you were you were ready to\nYou are sick of this whole absolutely you know and then you come home when you go to the university\nBut we didn't end up going into what we did it um through the program at home home study or go to our church is an hour and\nAnd in trapeze university but we didn't end up going to let we did it um through the program at home\nHome study I Gotcha yeah\nOur church is an hour and a half away and\nRun right now now now days you could just watch it all on line but it is different than they are\nVery good you guys so what is the\nKey to getting into that you paid off in eighty one thousand an Eighteen month one of the folks from Arkansas for\nAdults like in that they paid off alone as in thousand you're doing and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one month yes yeah All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt and you did it in Eighteen months\nUm\nI Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than\nIn the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything ... which she she did a good job as I could possibly expect exactly\nWhat she was by herself\nBut she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the big picture and you know guys being visual creatures the spreadsheet gave me the big picture ... and the color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a huge last summer the control one path\nNot involved but you gained um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYeah yeah it became amazing actually what happened with that with this was beyond and fiber death in grade because\nHe got so on board that what that and God on if we had a huge impact in this because he would have thought there'd be no more extension and that will back like just a few months before we started at man\nI'm about to be about a year into it he gets the call he he was home during one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they just got back for a week before but they wouldn't need him to come back\nA month early and he gets off the phone and he's like what do I do and I'm like I don't know they want to go back and he's like what what would it with our debt and I we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating\nAnd I'm like you know if you do this week at the out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like wow and I think it jumped on board and he he actually told them that he had it for the the month you know if they would if I'm an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee a ticket at all paid off in that time\nAnd congratulations you guys were so proud you said you've got a copy of Chris organs returns are booked for you that is the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you're going on\nAnd go ahead and I say one other thing that you got ten second machine was\nUm one of the kids for me was um

it your approach I mean that's that's going to be really hot as going to be really cool\nI really do you think so I\nHave five five four hundred Savage you get you on board the program a five five four hundred Savage\nAnd you're on board and have have you been paying attention to the stuff that the hurricanes okay I live in Florida so when I hear this stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they are getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of global warming I I said what and when I saw President Trump on Leslie stall on Sunday\nI said why would somebody a brief President Trump\nBecause the truth is there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet\nI don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when Lesley Stahl said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said Roy Spencer PHD\nBecause Roy Spencer has been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville he's ...\nBecause Roy Spencers been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville he's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming\nAnd global warming skepticism for busy people and he does it the facts from our own government and he's a he's got this out inconvenient data no trend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated apply to Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred\nAnd it includes hurricane Michael and here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of hurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many of the global warming movement does do excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is down word but it's in significant but it is downward not up words so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data\nThat the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to charity but\nBoy the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so expensive points out well yeah but if you look at the history of July August September average the temperature you'll see that since Eighteen sixty\nThis summer is only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico an out of the top ten warmest Gulf years since Eighteen sixty seven occurred both for Nineteen Seventy which is both full or we experienced any significant warming\nWell but we're going to get more of these really major hurricanes are part of nature Spencer points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle\nVery close to where Michael Bay land fall\nAnd he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but from one thousand to two thousand years ago\nThere was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words there's been time in this planet's history where there have been more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today or long before so called global warming\n\nBy the way the latest hurricane experts who claim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes they don't show any data for that\nAnd when Roy Spencer PHD put Michael in his count of all is all us landing major hurricanes it marked a downward trend since the thirties forties and fifties\nNot an upward trend not an upward trend\nAnd yet they still keep trying to make you think that is Massachusetts Bay colony and sixteen thirty five had a cat three or four storm with up to a twenty foot storm surge\nHappened again and sixteen Seventy five you don't see those anymore\nUntil twenty Seventeen the United states went eleven years without a major hurricane strike according to a NASA scientists that was the one in one hundred and Seventy seven year event to not have a strike that for that long and yet we're being told\nThat manmade global warming is increasing the number of storms and increasing the intensity and it's just not true based on that\nAnd yet lovely song made it seem like Trump did notice talking about she was the one the new he didn't know what do you think\nOh one more one more victory for Trump is getting tired of

W way Smith an anthropological geneticist at Dartmouth who researches a genetics and\nTribal sovereignty several experts is that the Carlos the wisdom on things that we're now stand for geneticists to them Warren hired to test the DNA and produced a solid results showing that itchy whereas Native American as as extend generations Warner's never claimed membership at a particular trial however there is a misconception here that this is\nAbsolutely definitive and it's not it is not the Senate if at all so all kinds of holes are being shot into this story and again it has backfired in his absolutely backfired I don't know who made the final decision who thought this was a good idea\nAnd then in her little video piece to hide the fact that it's a between six and ... as a six and ten generations back\nOr just stupid bad strategy absolute swing and miss a I mean worse than that let's rabbit Yolanda first today on Schmidt in California you'll learn the you're on ... go ahead\nI taught for taking my call yeah I just love the fact that wrong weeds out there and I know some people say oh you're in\n... he can say that you know what a great because you are American people are sick and tired of the news report it out there by CNN and MSNBC and sometimes even walk for that\nMatter but Trump and the new one out their own pointing out there and he's speaking my language and that I voted for from from the very gecko because we weren't thinking I was thinking for a lot of people out there\nAnd so the new one out there now when you did this thing with a a little bit worn\nWith her and you know how to play the game and so now we're back fired on her well\nIt was it from the question is did Trump forced to backfire by you know the whole Pocahontas moniker and Trump mocking her claims and\nThen essentially did Trump force her to make this era I mean folks this is an an forced air Elizabeth Warren made an error and you know I think there's an argument to be made that Trump toyed with her so much for ... to make the stupid reason with this non definitive information but\nAn error and you know I think there's an argument to be made that Trump toyed with there's so much for sort of make the stupid goes in with this non definitive information but you learn that was a you know Trump is a whole different kind of president a whole different type of communicator a bunch of times I think that his decorum could be better or a little more presidential well\nI Love what are you doing I think a lot of American what he's doing\nWell it's split you know it's if it's you know half of America and you know that doesn't like what he's doing but listen I again policy wise I I'm I'm right in line with him and I think he's doing a fantastic job or many bronze blocked on on certain levels I Wish that he would\nYou know some of the whole thing I you know I I'm not calling a Stormy Daniels horse face today\nMan you know what he can it can be legally assertive but I don't know if if calling a horse face a helps [laughter] I mean I got a chuckle out of it but still a president though that that's a that's a question that we in Christ is in Idaho Chris you're next on Schmidt I\n... a tie the thanks for taking my call I was actually came across her show I thought it was called the shirt show a first and I I got excited because I Do love shirts but ah yeah excited to speak with you it is it's my last name it's the ... show\nYeah yeah I thought it was shirt initially but um yeah this whole thing with Elizabeth Warren a yeah one of the big time the all time backfires I mean and um I got a question for you do you think you think this is a bigger backfire or do you think it's as big of or a bigger backfire [noise]\nUh [noise]\nThank you [laughter] uh let's grab a paint in riverside California Pete you're on Schmidt high [noise]\nHey yeah hey look at the numbers three and a half a generation for a hundred years she's Nineteen fifty she was born ... to ...

have to raise an eyebrow be suspicious of the Democrat\nAppointing this out a yeah certainly however the outrage here is bipartisan and it should be if they killed this guy it shouldn't be Democrats outraged Republicans not no no no no no\nEveryone ought to be pissed beyond belief and Trump ought to be really super angry be cause was used by the Saudis\nTo help out can cock their story\nYou know there was also the item last week than we are to intercept we intercept that they were planning on interrogating cars so it's all adding up\nAnyway within hours of Trump telling reporters that Solomon's denied involvement or CNN\nThen you have the wall Street Journal that it was NBC News they reported that the sources are telling them that the Saudi Government is preparing to admit that the show he was killed at the consulate but are they going to go with this road story you know as I pointed out yesterday\nUh oh yeah we just we want to ask them a few questions and ah one of our guys ah you know Mohammed been something or other well he got a little out of hand road so they're going to suggest that among the Fifteen hit squad members they sent over\nThat somebody went rogue in the group and they were just going to have a harsh talk with him but this rural guy he got out of hand I chopped off some fingers then an armed and his head and whatever [noise]\nIt seemed to be able to go down that path and as I suggested on yesterday\n[noise] shopped on some fingers then an arm than his head and whatever [noise]\nIt seems to go down that path and as I suggested on yesterday's program are they going to make some of the fall guy and you know a publicly arrest this individual and\nPut him to death for that because what they're gonna try to cover the ashes of the crown prince of Mohammad ...\nBeen a salon and the kings I get it they don't do anything to cover their butts\nIs when it comes down to\nThat it's taken a while the Saudis are trying to get their story straight here which again it's all over the road but this is like a like a drunk driver when of a point to six they're all over the road on this thing\nAnd I can't give their story straight and yeah they're trying to give the king and the crown prince or a good friend of Jared Kushner\nThey're trying to establish some plausible deniability here\nA little bit of separation again or this this rogue operative that that's where they're headed on this that and the king and prints had no of course they knew give me a break of course that nothing happens nobody sneezes without them knowing\nBut what ought to terrify every one is they thought they can get away with this you know we've got a lot of this going between Vladimir ...\nYeah there are stories of all of them the ... are enemies whoever putting does the like and they ended up dead in jail they disappear\nI saw a story last week or last weekend I probably can dig it up here somewhere or three a well known businessman a complete our adversaries a potent both at ... and also read that up they're done [noise]\nIt was a coincidence yeah sure", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "16"}
