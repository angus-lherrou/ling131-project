stretch here we're only a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections and\nYou know again which way is this going to go to the red white and blue wave in you know who who knows the big question is again voter turnout and there are numerous\nReports from around the country that\nIs still a concern that while there is a whole lot of enthusiasm that both sides have charged you've got the immigration obviously you've got the Kavanaugh issue I I mean there's you've got the anti Trump crowd on the other side the issue here is that\nThere are reports coming out that many\nWhile maybe energize they don't plan to vote in the mid term elections so I saw this piece um it came from the Houston Chronicle\nAs the Houston Chronicle but it looks like it might have been to a wider peace and it's just talked about you know this is a day right on the story was Clarksville, Tennessee interested in the mid term election is that a fever pitch and much of the country of both Democrats and

world are traveling of the developed nations so that's just an interesting piece that you know and and this is a study on on this particular area but again\nWhat remains to be seen as a larger picture is that turn out for the midterms going to be\nSimilar to a presidential election year now I've seen that some of the cable news channels I get a treat the mid term election night they get a tweet that Tuesday night and early November as if it were because of the importance of the midterms and the hope that that's the case\nTonight they get a tweet that Tuesday night and early November as if it were because of the importance in the midterms and the hope that that the Democrats have to hopefully not take back the house of representatives a long shot the salad I that the the cable networks are

I've done my best to try to give you straight data because we now know that about Seventy two thousand people every year in the United states over does and the overdose because of opioids but we're actually lumping to problems together\nAre based on the numbers I've been able to find about five or six thousand of those Seventy two thousand died because of abuse of\nOf pharmaceutical drugs the kind that come from a legitimate companies are and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs like heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derek ... who's a former special agent in charge us a sea of United\nStates Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration and the special operations division and he's involved in a documentary called not invading a dark welcome to the program\n... hey how are you a break you'd be on the program\nI'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody my family at least that I'm aware of who's had that but I I Know of some you know for some folks I'm acquainted with who've lost kids they've lost family\nMembers because of addiction to heroin an addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are I Want you to tell my\nAudience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary about this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the DEA says about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only of public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels edit dumping\nPoison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right there's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now that they asked majority is being\nKilled from the mixtures solve this potent fence and all of a synthetic drug coming right from China you have the labs and China and the mixing it with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that you picked it on heroin it's a college kid that things taken to add a little pill is going to keep 'em alert into ... into quiet in class\nAnd stay focused but what they don't realize is the bill's mixed with pencil and by the way for the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams of bent and all the killing adult but we have a we have a much larger issue laws because\nYou know another thing is these terrorist groups like Hezbollah they're tapping\nInto the criminal networks to their funding and the resources we had a case a couple of years ago well on June ... will be two hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah and he was moving the proceeds furloughs that is a you know cartel you know so we have\nA very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not\nIn vain Marron rake who's Twenty years old she was a beautiful young girl who had very much you know love their family passion polite typical kid you know playing sports you of the capital of the golf team and lots of friends and then a brother

point is is they don't know what the Getty and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have\nYou know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control they care about making money and growing their business enterprise and the scary part\nLarge is the fact that China is developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country and China is a communist country so you know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know then by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple facets of this problem Derek\nI'm Talking to dirt mall choose a former spouse\nTheir their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple facets of this problem ...\nI'm Talking to a dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the ... at the da\nDa da da da da da da da to try to interdict some of these drug operations\nInside their borders because that seems like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you point out a tiny quantity goes a long way or the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know what the controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even\nLike technically illegal and so the U.S government\n... the department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently what China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but laws honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean the\n... the politics the politicians will make like everything's moving down to write and uh but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese expert but we do know and your listeners know that China is a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know their debt hacking\nOpt computers they're stealing our identities that going after a financial grades and I lecture grades so you know dumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic\nIs for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west when making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans so this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially you know what's going on depending on who in China is actually standing at all well\nBecause it was about what they accomplish if they can manufacture the drugs cheaply and the ... the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen there not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash\nFrom producing those stuff flows back into China one way or the other which is good for trying to because ... and the soup financially so they they get tired and I get to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cache of the same time it's a win win and fat and I\nI call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just in it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and\nThere's so many illegals here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections the drug distribution stash houses you know building compartments these guys are all over our country\nA and honestly we've got to shut down that damn border\nAnd I want to really make a difference but stuck it in the military involved in my mind to my opinion\nIn my opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website\n... department of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense look at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have\nDifferent authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that border and knock this nonsense off with just put the politics you know if you look at nine eleven [noise] the Iraq\nWar the Afghanistan war you add up every one that died in ... and then even the Vietnam War [noise] it's still less than how many people died last year from drugs so what is the American public in a ... wake up\nI stopped listening to these phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocket books in their wallets and their futures they're not really in it for the public safety or national security aspects\nOf the story is told in not in vain to brand new documentary or Derrick molds is very involved and Derek thank you for your work at the ... you know that's a dangerous and tough job and

I'm just bashing and end up costing a woman who is the widow of one of the police officers who died in the nine eleven terrorist attacks\nIn New York City and this guy\nThis is running on Fox and I run a today earlier and I may play ... I can play some it if you'd like\nBut these are two people they're not confronting each other the woman is just standing at a street corner a I guess are both perhaps headed in the direction of a protest the ... guy for his side of the protest and the widow of a police officer in the direction of the you know a a a different protests to counter protest but this man begins to things that young man\nAnd the woman is not wouldn't say older but she's she's older than he is um and he just begins bashing or cursing or a wishing that her husband a you know rocks in his grave after she informs him the she's the widow of a police officer who died in the terrorist attack\nAnd I don't see it running on a lot of other of the sort of mainstream media other than Fox on cable um or should they be have you\nSee I haven't yet I've seen as it is yes and it I lost two of my classmates for nine eleven which is nothing in comparison to losing a family member but I I you know for people who live in Washington I live in New York this was a local attack not just a national attack we all knew people and\nYou know this is very personal and I watch it and it gets so angry at the get go walk with the computer I said that's my reaction but this is how\nThe American news media fix everything they get we always end up talking about biased by commission there the oh this comeback said this is going back and said that\nYou know this reporter lied or this they did this thing but the worst bias in news media is biased by omission they hide the things that are uncomfortable to their narrative if they went out there and you've got Chris Cuomo Chris Matthews both out there saying oh they're Republicans are hyping this mob ... it's all garbage it's all a lie and when in fact\nNo it's the absolute truth it is a problem and you've got your monsters like this city and in a you know I Am salute monster to do this he must have seen had I think\nHe I think he did because she was wearing an

start talking you and that kind of threatening manner\nThey're committing a crime is it's no longer free speech you would think this would be getting a lot of play in the major media CNN MSNBC and with them having to but then they'd have\nTo explain that a lot of these antifa creeps this is their regular MO all they do is attack\nPeople even people who are doing nothing provocative\nThings that they say I mean I I Know why I was ...\nYears and years of watching lifted protests under my belt I just things that the car they call for ... police officers on you know they'll do a live broadcast the name a police officer Gulf reduction and police officers to allow things they say the police officers and go\nOh you know you just said I Can't even read tea\nThey just said this to this woman you know this is where the leftist this doesn't end well there there's so much pent up anger on their side and that they want to confront you want to her she wanted to cause a scene that's what they tried to\nIn state governments all around the country that also includes two suicides ... and all\nOn accusations of sexual misconduct now there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I said don't collected a connect the dots but\nThey have been weaponized this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they seem to go after Democrats who are telling them\nThe party line surprisingly yeah those are the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a so something very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\n... you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along with bad people and you had some folds accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets I wouldn't think\nNo they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned Hugh in Colorado you know there were two very suspicious cases won in Colorado one in Arizona\nSteve loves soccer in Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't bank on these people fighting back\nWhat they wanted to do was forced them out scare the heck out of them and asked them to resign they were targeted and and I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a um a day in which Democrats\nAnd Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years never had been an expulsion in Colorado State house of representatives that day\nA Democrat got up and said because my wife was molested when she was Seventeen\nOr I'm going to vote yes on the expulsion of ...\n... and now this is these are law makers who\nAre putting forth arguments that would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so I that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process a long time ago [noise] [noise]\nIn fact the larva got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the litter of guidance of one of the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate sort of charges against say student athletes\nWho are thought to have committed some sexual assault then put it into effectively a kangaroo court ah and and in those cases it's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think most\nPeople too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student or out late who may be officially a Democrat or virtually Republican but you know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would uh\nFor the Republican but you know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer and with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like like a judge Kavanaugh had\nOr no justice Kavanaugh had so I I just want it or not or that and thank God for that but you wonder how much whether they're going to go and eat almost instantaneous reaction well if he's accused you must be guilty and let's move on to the next one that's a dangerous standard to adopt an a due process country like America\nWithout a doubt in my many concerns about this is the notion that you can uh build some kind of a\n... when he goes well let me go back to what you said at the beginning ... these are people who've been trashing the culture all along and and in a heartbeat\nHe had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans so number\nOne we cannot buy in to this idea the left is brilliant and building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notions and that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was\nIt was stunning and riveting to hear I saw that video and and you've got lawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nYeah and that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where when an ... person does something that is a criminal uh salt in most communities to merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today\nAnd just started shouting at them and screaming at them and I did it for any length of time if there was a police officer within\nYou know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for certain people\nBecause they opposed Trump and then we're saying but for everyone else there

be one\nOf president of Americans for tax reform and you can reach them an eight six six Ninety red eye if you have any tax questions and we'll we use that in a but I wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cuts passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful first step or one of the things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals\nTop rate was Seventy percent ... percent during World War two a Kennedy took it from Ninety Seventy Reagan took it from seven eight to twenty eight [noise]\nUnfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama raised it back up towards south over forty percent and a show at the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was where the line with the rest of the off\nA the rest of the world started experimenting with lower business taxes lower lower corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economically a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungry it's business tax nine percent we're at thirty five we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how come we can't compete with China and Germany and stuff like that and\nIreland to Ireland's business taxes twelve and a half percent a week what thirty thirty five plus an average of ... percent by state and local governments so really thirty nine on average and\nUh the Republicans took that down to Twenty one and it made us more competitive on the tax ... than most of the country's law\nThe average European countries about twenty five or ten points better than what we used to be you know we were at thirty five they were twenty five and they would beat us when they somebody to take a million dollars I live in Brazil invested ... million dollars what do I put it\nTo invest it and I take those joke thirty five percent of everything I if I put it in Germany you only take twenty fall or the German uh and we shifted that down and we have seen a massive\nA diversion of a foreign direct investment out if you're in the United states uh for starters there was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months\nWhich was arranged by American companies over seats\nAnd we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform punished you if you brought me back to the states he left it overseas is maybe three trillion dollars to the left overseas I'm\nPartly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you if you want to bring the money to act and if you don't bring it back that's okay [noise]\nAh show three trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy and\nWe said you know we're not doing that anymore if you earn money United States we tax it but if your money in ... the French people take some and then we're going to bring it back home the America good no taxes no hell no penalty for bringing back a bit about that\nAnd uh we've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars by it and come back last six months\nAnd an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars or earnings overseas they brought Ninety billion right back and then said you know what because it's no longer pedal lives to boot buddy from London to New York or Texas um\nWe may not bring it all back now it's all coming back but right now they leave it in in the London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access\nTo capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas uh whereas before it did show the money might as well are ready to be back but we've seen a half a trillion come back immediately and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and a Brazilians making decisions are sending their money to the United states rather than ... oversees this really irritating Europeans because we're much more competitive than we used to be and\nThat's been a big help\nYeah no I can see why is it just seems so obvious\nWe're much more competitive than we used to be and it's been a big help\nYeah no I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions or we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also what right now we're going to take our that our national forecast or um the trend\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of\nSnow with the system on Lake Erie now from Erie P. A. O. to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRain for Texas continues today we're looking at close to two months worth of rain for some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's a little too warm for\nAnd not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper like freshman year at Harvard and\nThey like flunked meow that they said you know this does come from a conversation I had with the IRS I called the phone and said if they did if he didn't look hold taxes out of their paycheck every two weeks ... once a month to satisfy the check like the electric bill and Fonda\nOr on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the the paper is right it he said that the revolution it\nTheir way out I think if someone had to write you know check five times little on ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nVery yeah it make it\nClear to actually pay no let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise]\nThink appreciate it I'll tell you what you just two words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's ... percent a\nCross report it don't matter whether you're right a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there McDonalds\nSeven percent limit I every ... ... that there is as far as they are with tax you eliminate all federal tax is whether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name it if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the sixteenth and bad but and then\nIn order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress\nThat means you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up for it be for it\nTo become a ballot or election of on every two years that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register voters in order for the tax to be re\nAnd I think you know and as you just mentioned are it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter\nAnd believe me when people realized how much they're paying out taxes they would\nThey would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't believe how much I was having to pay a tax is\nAn interesting Grover what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions or in California in Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes stake then but once raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds or to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows the passion spenders down doesn't stocking completely really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support or\nIt doesn't stop them completely but it really slows down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support a to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes uh would dramatically change our policy curious\n\nWhat do you think about some people would pose a sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is American countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff and\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck\nA so they put that twenty percent at every level of production and the farmer pays that the guy who trucks goods into town pays\nA twenty percent on his value out of the way to get a twenty percent tax but it little amounts and there's no one place we can avoid ah the difference between the United states and Europe is it your and has a sales tax of a national sales tax of value\nAdded tax which gets every level of a production [noise] ah it's why they have higher taxes than we do they have stupid income taxes and high income taxes but you can only get so much money out of the income tax people will quit working they'll work around to hide money [noise] um\nWhen you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do we don't have a sales tax they do some people say no no we want to sweat rather the income tax and have a national sales tax tax\nIn stat much kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese the Asians and and the Africans when they put that in overseas\nOr it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could and I'm for bringing the income tax down towards zero I'm\nWhat you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ... how\nWould that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or\nIt it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check everything you buy from your house chair car cheer\nJeer food dear close would cost more than the taxes would be hidden than that so um I think going to a single rate tax income tax or and would do sing spending is to go to know if you got taxes\nDown enough that you could shift from a ten percent income tax\nToo you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax because get discovery water a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size\nBefore you could with that and you really have to have protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have\nHad been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the part of politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right is part of this have you know give me a this donation someone on a lower tax this they don't want the things solved eventually right but I Would reduce their campaign contributions gathering fault on my part of\nHaving taxes that are complicated allows politicians to raise money or to protect people bit by bit where everyone's you're paying\nA one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians and\nLawyers and accountants maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more what about the mission or um how do you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to have a situation\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will be pushing for tax increases that while at least a trillion dollars and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade at least to try and I'm from where we were we cut\nTaxes uh trading and a half ... they want to raise them a trillion from where we were so\nThat is true and a half trillion dollars in taxes per decade that they wanted to increase taxes there'll be pushing for that\nI I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they will get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want the military to get paid will only do that only passed a budget ...\nAh the soldiers and airmen and Tim and by that if you get me into action because they will they will spend two years trying to get a tax increase um\nAnd then ten and buy it it's getting the attention because\nThey will they will spend two years trying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on 'em by Democrats\nOn the tax issue like teenage boys on a Sunday they keep asking for the same thing in different ways that just again and again and again they keep coming back I Want one thing going higher taxes are\nAnd they will ask that question twenty different ways of the green taxes\nIt will save the planet that will be\nAnd the taxes that only paid the other people a day while we hack into the same tax increase on Desmond ways\nMaybe maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything in your work

some of you are and I want to tell you we got some news that is very very\nInteresting yes and ah we've got some reports that in Connecticut between two thousand and eight\nAnd twenty ten more than eight thousand young people registered to vote\nIn the most recent election cycle that\nNumber has jumped to well\nOver forty three thousand\nIt's just\nYounger voters who are stirring up election fever that news is breaking\nAnd a one young person by the name of militia Ferraro she says I think you're going to be up there and I'm going to be right there too because of the governor's race\nYou can't have an opinion if you don't vote the deadline\nOf course to register to vote on line is October thirtieth and after that you could still register on election day for absentee\nBallots you can get them until the day before\nAnd a must be in by the time the polls close those are the rules but uh I have been you know something I've been talking to a good many books and just asking\nThem questions and more and more\nHave told me that\nUh they think the young vote is going to be heavy in Connecticut so uh we'll have to wait and see but the the\nThe numbers are much a much larger than they have been in the last five to six years with a young young voters already\nAlready I uh\nI think it's going to be very very close no question about it and I I did it you know generally I have somebody who I think is going to it's going to make it and when but I I tell you I I Would have done to be honest with you I'm a I'm holding back this time\nI really ah I really am I I\nDon't know who is going to make it and I tell you one thing\nNow I've got this report on young people who are going to turn out however I said to you yesterday I don't know if you heard me or not that I think it's going to be\nA tremendous\nI said to you yesterday I don't know if you heard me or not that I think it's going to be a tremendous women's vote I think the women are really going to be out there\nReally going to be out there now if any of you who are up yet I Want to give me some of your thoughts feel free I'm right here one eight eight eight five seven\nFour to seven to three and my partner Paul per se Eli I Will be here it's six o'clock that's when he starts with the every every morning and uh he hasn't really given any indication\nAs to what he thinks\nBut it it's it's it's going to be a culture it's going to be very very close and ah the only thing that I think is going to happen I didn't know I had no idea that the that the number of young voters would be\nAs high in Connecticut as it is\nAnd I've got it right here got it right here but I Do believe this is my one prediction that I'm sure of a and that is a that more women\nMore women will be voting this year than than before\nThis is going to be one of the\nOne of the big once one of the big ones for for women but uh again this is the I think it's tremendous what do we get a good many people out to vote and uh the the young people let me tell you something\nLet me let me tell you\nA board Connecticut or Connecticut these numbers are really are really or something and the\nYoung folks are going to vote genetic it sees roughly a fifty\nPercent turnout much lower than the presidential years but this year the state is expecting a larger than normal voter turnout especially with young voters I've got that that is the headline\nDid it surprise me absolutely so ah it's gonna be interesting\nIt is going to be interesting and I I Do have I Do have a gut feeling that the more people are going to vote this year than ever here in Connecticut I have that that feeling because you know what it is\nLater on this morning but I Want you to know about them and uh one\nBig story is a climate change is a moving target in the governor's race all of a sudden\nWhile the issue of climate change hasn't gained a lot of traction in the gubernatorial debase recent news events have moved it if not to the front burner at least a off the back\nBurner let's put it that way or the combination of yet another devastating hurricane hitting this time in Florida and Georgia and a new interview given by president Donald Trump to\nSixty minutes this past Sunday has stirred the debate about whether human habits have helped create the especially the hurricane season this year and whether it changes of those habits\nWill make a difference in back here in Connecticut climate change has taken a backseat\nDuring they given a ... a debates to a question about taxes\nAnd the state's economic woes global warming is an important issue that has real consequences that's the word from Republican nominee Bob ... he says that ah that being said\nI also believe we need to take the politics out of the discussion because both the left and the right use the environment as a political punching bag\nBecause both the left and the right use the environment as a political punching bag\nAnd it shouldn't be ... during a debate forum on October the seventh ... downplayed the state's role in climate change by saying the federal government\nWill have to do more they'll have to have a lot tougher impact\nSo

I Want to see if this resonates with you at all you see I think well I Will share my theory was even among the ... this is John Berman reacting to the same bite you just heard\nPresident Trump saying I loved when this guy mark who's running for Congress in ... in Montana\nOr I Love any body slam that reporter and yeah he was charged your body so I guess a reporter came up to him was abused will be four bodies flying we got talk Trump was tickled\nBy it and said Joe on the stump John Berman said there's nothing like making a joke out of body slamming reporter\nWhen another journalist was dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago and the administration has been dealing with that damage control and trying to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day and that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter Jake comes by the Scottish\n... he's talking about Greg ... a ... G unfortunate who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana um\nDoes this Walsh with you does this negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows and teeth of that whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're sitting\nDoes the congressmen in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were say by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump side comment I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this not unlike Lesley Stahl which we we decomposed ... or ... or a demystify that interview written decompose that we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Lesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of\nThe media and I think when ... when the media begins\nIts echo and they stopped having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tombs them out in fact\nThis is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look because they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing\nWhat is this guy really doing and they looked closely that may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms\nI see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term\nOr will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey\nWhat do you think clip what moved do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nAnd meet the poll is\nThat the Democrats I Believe or behind this march and drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their bathroom goose praying to treat them\nComing north and you're going to find those Democrats and the publisher and that will change\n... you're talking about the ... which we're going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan as moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nLet's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this character\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as\nA Catholic migration refugee services came up with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get hundreds of millions of dollars in federal\nThese ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as he's contracted the number of refugees allowed into the country\nTheir coffers serve emptied so they have a material financial interest in this\nAnd it's hard to think that these dramatic displays the people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the Caribbean\nWe're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals' it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse and I can't separate you so you have a catch and release policy happening\nWhere they're coming across the border we're taking their names were releasing them into mainland American\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with that you can and clip thank you very much for the call a will also share some other uh reports with you here of how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for ... we're right back stay there\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nYeah well with this economy which we're going to get into later I mean I you know I think sometimes Americans get swept up in the emotional moment or the headline in the moment and they forget\nThe government and presidents have very limited powers in purposes and it really is to ensure mostly our security and then to give us a playing field where we can rest opportunities and uh and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary job\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues\nOr whether it be you know a Tom said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis\nCutting of journalists to ribbon you're on on that the emotional play that the Democrats are trying to use in this mid term might that be effective given the difficult tenants out there\n[noise] well I think the ... to ... in my view the Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent [noise]\nBut when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue [noise] uh and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do or pretend they're going to do since they only they can go to believe is the one house of representatives of what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is tromp\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and\nI'm now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls\nOn the president's approval ratings are are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats\nTo hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen and if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like for Trump [laughter]\nI'm sure did hell [laughter]\nBut noted veteran gay shouldn't you know as far as the eye and\nSay anything that can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to a Republican Senate then\nSent it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into it\nPresident Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into\nAny financial connections with Saudi Arabia that got to get the Boulder report W looking into alleged you know alleged ... of obstruction of justice than the Russia investigation\nAll of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue here you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know\nThe goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up but you go ahead and announced that is your goal and you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad base of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... and I want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to bed all three James a beta Rourke or who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say\n[laughter] and he said in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime that tree than primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge was\nThe exact opposite [laughter]\nDoes that help it doesn't help better over or can it was in a ... and ... got his own problems he's not or ten voyage down or sixty two million and the bad guys but I you know no I don't think it helps him I think\nWe're better off work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in a foreign land\nFor the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and an Eighteen ...\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that trap or\nYou'll find a laundromat put him in a corner you and put you on the record year\nDo you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected Trump\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nOr they've got to lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination until the court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over us but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\n... ... you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch\nOK you take it easy Randy thank\nYou pat and uh and all you're listening what is driving you to the polls this November are you is is there an issue it was the one idea that you could not lose and you felt you had to to move on\nUm I keep hearing it was common all others say they're concerned about the border still others say this mob mentality or you know we're going to play you a little bit you know that what the president said during that rally last night what the

I think there are some industry is lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I I\n... and here's the thing that I Would say and you're right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman from and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment\nBut at the same time the there are people like you\nWho aren't feeling the full effect of this\nAnd need to know that the a he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician he doesn't fix everybody every aspect\nOf every life the only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that the people want from a president our security and prosperity and prosperity is best gained\nBy having an even playing field where you're not owners sleep taxed or regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited his powers are limited and I think the media and everybody else\nI mean why are we focusing on a journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nA but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia there are rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap\nShoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process then no due process as they're due process is well let's see what side do you want to be roasted all well and from\nUnderstanding as well as the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but he's our domestic Saudi Arabia in politics problems I Know would be best advised the U.S does not have any interest in million these domestic\nPayout well as it turned me there that's beyond the president's ah of the capabilities and frankly beyond its purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them\nWe should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad we have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries\nAll you can do is suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough enough but ah the media I can prove it to MSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this\nIt enough enough but ... the media I can prove it to MSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or\nA ... story okay the journalist that may have been mutilated dismembered in a\nSaudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia okay neither of them have particularly great human rights record in fact they don't but we can only hold them out MSNBC and CNN lid with this for two nights they lost the ratings\nBy double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined no one is interested in this short\nAnd it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy with presidents the in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so to push that narrative\nAnd to drive it to try to get Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going to take a quick break when we return all of your calls what's driving you to the polls eight five five forty Laura Raymond ... sitting in for Laura Ingraham we'd lots of cultural news to share with you soon I'm On Twitter at\n... she said Ingram angle and be sure to watch the incremental tonight ten pm eastern live Trump rally from ...

had bobcat but all the all the posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so we we drove recently called them the pansies anyway um\nTell me where we stand in these midterms mad or when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does rain if it's a great question um you know basically that generic ballot has been as high as\nFourteen Fifteen points uh CNN and had a poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that showed that why what you're seeing is that\nIt almost all the old like that is there a way that's a that's a common thread\nThat a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because there aren't a lot of big cities and quite frankly there aren't\nA lot of people who aren't at work which don't tend to be Republican uh and as you get close election they got a better idea of actually going to vote remember rabid mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the people vote so dirty actually going to vote if\nThat's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll\nThat has Democrats up three in the toss up districts now if you're only up three in the ... district that's within the margin of error and in the trunk total era I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call break\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a one come out to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed as a clean story don't worry as you said um she said hey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad\nAbout the ... street in the capital I'm voting for the first time it it it ... it or this is ...\nThis strengthens his hand this is his issue\nBorder security border safety um stopping at a process that does not permit order and promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on so this cuts\nI think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nFor the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary it's very rare for president ... after his first you know in the middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum\nBut Trump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say but\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and Schumer I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths\nAnd I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying about these mid term elections\nI think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly the people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit in coffee houses\nI go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of America ... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these\nLittle white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here frankly you there are parts of places you know I I ... you could go never see a black person never see it Hispanic face in some of these restaurants\nThat it it ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way it it it's a very wealthy place and\nPeople are very divided live separate lives not in New Orleans we are side by side\nWas your music we share food we enjoy each other's company would drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras together\nUm and you hear a lot when you're in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you I think there's a lot of the disgruntled men out there\nWith not only the mob stuff but the tone and the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it it seems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look\nThe Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z\nThey didn't do that they have no what are you going to do\nYou're gonna run against joblessness you're going to run against high wages you gonna run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you with Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit she called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around to your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you want you want and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of its Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on during these midterms\n... exactly right I think the Democrats are not like they're evil you look at what they it again I Can't do a brain Brett Kavanaugh of a judge\nRight Kevin out there for any white because they're you know they were kind of control that they ... and they will vote and that group got the boat\nAnd they would go back that your state for a while and\nWe lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I got a point and I think you know to to to too many the Supreme Court has become the holy of hold as\nIt is almost a high church too to some on the left where they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change and to ...\nAnd deprived of it they feel they somehow lost something that's era treatable\nSo this was a major blow even though a Brett Kavanaugh as a down the middle of the road straight down the middle jurists she's not a radical he's not he's not the next battle is going to be the battle royale\nYou want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round of confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives up her seat and from a points maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more\nA a a rich restrictive jurists one who reads the law and interprets that appropriately\nAnd doesn't make it up if you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans I mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm up but what awaits that nominee thanks for the call Terry\nOr we're going to take a very quick break we'll be back in moments

I deserve a new house a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy and this did all you do would you use kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first year that because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now I I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably well behaved so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty want all\nOf this fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader uh I\nWould say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own in it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the debt I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't\nReally have another planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYeah you're paying them almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of it so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now\nAre you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely leaned so as you're going lawyer you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah Fifteen to twenty month only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in more you before the before kind of the switch kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smaller flown first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there is no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do that\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking 'em off the little baby ones when you first started yeah\nAnd that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost definitely that snowball really kicked in for you then they get everybody was supposed to do it lets you know that this was going to work mhm wow wow wow wow wow wow All right so what is the big takeaway when someone says\nOh I I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never got to that and I once I face it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money and they are their income as much less I'm sure they know what mine is but I learned most people's\n[laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past and they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and um it makes for more purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and I'm\nYou know there was a there was a sense a character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this that's what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you

probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you wanna funds a Roth IRA re for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning they're learning work\nThey're learning interface with customers on how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit to capitalism is not

towards it you know since I'm sure\nThat ... dot com [noise]\nTo have a kid go off to college is off\nBecause it is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive goes I mean we're talking a thousand to eighty thousand a year spread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same costs it's just not and it's the number one mistake\nBeen cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same costs it's just not\nAnd it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called\nRamsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we're now in\nForty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers\nThis common sense stuff of staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and\nAll of that kind of thing then what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school\nTo have foundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming has decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming\nNeeds to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it dang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college university\nSays we're going to take care of these high schoolers in our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the\nWyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle why or to go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to\nPartner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable being for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition or any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the parents are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of ... that's correct wow very cool very cool\nAnd I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you what am I doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this\nUh about this campaign and and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nThat this is our our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hat that ride off into the friends that we are talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that\nCan be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and vote for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people it resembles the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a capital isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I measure mascot right\nThat is that correct your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think\nThey ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first where this way to go man I Love it it's a great motto\nOr does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is it going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nHappy to be happy to be a partner\nIt's the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we're we are we are state that is very practical were state that very\nMuch um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nUm and the wind is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college to sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor invites transferred the emergence of Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThe ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process such searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow renting institution we are near the very lowest Bert non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping a student be successful not just students success and part of that\nIs not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nThey meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand so it was twelve thousand a little over twelve thousand four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school and it's not too big and small and so that's that's just right as a Goldilocks deal drugs right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes

stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something\nEvery high school in the states some states have more on the schools and others can you imagine\nYou

that all they have to do is knock on our border or just come to our border and jump in and\nHey you got to take us I'm Sorry we can't take everyone we're a country of laws that has to be orderly immigration and you can have a flood of continuous thousands and thousands of people uh\nYou know hardships or making a hardship claims that want to come into this country it's just it's not fair and

let them have open borders for themselves and see if they want to advocate that for the rest of us\nIf they have security systems in their houses or apartments were yank those out as well do away with it [laughter] limited it's just yank hires right out of\nThem live with open borders and we can even go a step further and through what used ministry she did when they put all the uh somebody illegals

H. turned up the music so loud depressurizes were vibrating nearly impossible to do live TV I suppose the W. H.
