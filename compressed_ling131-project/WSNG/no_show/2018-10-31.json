an expression of you know what people face doing their best which just care about others but it was a reminder now that a community that used to worry about Jews and the Soviet Union\nNow has to like

believe that this is a totalitarian\nBrutally repressive anti Semitic a massage stick homo phobic\nUm you know a intolerant\nDoctrine of authoritative Islam is a is being practiced increasingly in Europe and it's creating I think an environment that's dangerous they're much as we're seeing in other parts of the world it's a it's it's dangerous for both Jews and Christians and those I said\nThat sign outside the synagogue a tree of life had squirrel hill minute Pittsburgh inspired an\nEffort that I've been involved in a coal to save\nThe persecuted Christian Coalition and we're looking at\nIn addition to what Jews are experiencing a two hundred and Fifteen\nMillion Christians around the world are being heavily persecuted I don't mean they're just having a hard time getting a job or you know people are unpleasant to the I'm Talking about people are being tortured or raped or a driven from their homes or a crucified or or murder\nOn mass and that is part and parcel of what's going on it's not just let me be clear it's not just Islamists who are doing it but an awful lot of them are are beating the state at the hands of those folks and we need to be alive to the fact that it's a it's it's creeping a through\nVarious parts of the western world just as an example are like just another excursions out that's just this past\nWeek a good friend of mine a woman by the name of Elizabeth ... of Austria or was founded by the European Court of human rights to have trans grass by\nSpeaking about the prophet Mohammed exercising her freedom of speech which he has the right to do it's not\nConstitutionally guaranteed as here but even in Europe you have a right under their human rights convention to speak but apparently according to the court\nHave a right to their human rights the budget to speak but\nApparently according to the court not if you offend others religious feelings as they put it well that's a real blast with me that is the leading edge of the effort to force a you know a civilization to submit to this should be a\nDoctrine and program it ...\nIt is very uh let me throw another idea at you and this one is one I just just occurred to me as you were speaking about that Frank\nRemember how we worried about the last couple of years did the Soviet Union tried to use Facebook and other social media or it's hard not to sort of you and your Russia or did they use it to try to change the outcome of an election and we also while their their efforts were kind of puny uh but you know we don't want people doing that anyway or having a foreign\nPower trying to interfere with our elections\nI heard the discussion the other night that was talking about the fact that an awful lot of these anti somebody's like Robert ... hours or you know the guy who said all the Jews must die as he was being taken into custody a synagogue on Saturday\nThey've been pushed off can most conventional social media because social media sites like Twitter and Facebook say we don't want you on your so they've gone to other alternative ones that are more you know wild wild west when it comes to you can say anything you want\nAnd they said that you know in some ways that's good because it gets them away from the conventional sites where most of the people are focusing their social media but his bad\nIn the sense that they almost disappeared from public view until they pop up doing something like what Robert Bowers is accused of doing and it occurred to me\nIf you were in the middle east and you are a sure real law you know a a proponent for at\nHere and and you said how can we screw things up in America and how can we advance our cars because they clearly hate Israel and hate the Jewish people\nOne of the ways they might do it and they could do it from a distance would be to get on social media and encourage the Robert ... hours of the world couldn't they but does anybody even looking for that phenomena\n[noise] I I think people are\nAre perhaps not enough and maybe not aggressively enough but let me just add\nSomething to to round out what you've said you hours because it seems to me that it's at least as problematic that a while or the social media platforms that Google's Facebook's the twitters and so on are are\nMigrating the Robert powers\nOffice there are pages on the grounds that they're saying violent or hateful things they're also using the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a political warfare instrument of the left to try to keep people like\nOf course Congress does have authority to extend the citizenship that whomever lives but it's never acted to extend citizenship this far and so\nA really this could be corrected\nToday tomorrow it doesn't need an amendment to the constitution as many people who objected to the\nRumors about what President Trump is planning to do it doesn't actually required amendments of the constitution the change of this it's really been a mistake and application of the fourteenth amendment by the other branches that has given us this problem\nWell if there's no statutory law to speak up on those and there is the amendment\nAnd all it takes is the bureaucracy to behave differently as you said the passport office or any other government agency that takes into account where you are what what country you're a citizen of primarily the state department\nThan it is within the president's power to say stop issuing passports or any other documents to people who are not citizens by birth right and and then that\nOh I understand it you could actually what\nWhat we have is we have a a statute eight USC fourteen or one that's simply repeats the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying something that to the jurisdiction there rather than it's been executive application or you could say miss application of this language\nIt's given us the current problem and the president wanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct it of course what we've seen during the Trump Administration is that\nFederal judges a hostile to the president has\nFloored at his attempts to exercise is a legitimate authority in connection with in rats and eat grass of foreign people so I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this if the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nReal courts about this if the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nWell and in this case that law was written I think in fifty two and the other one we spend a lot of time with I think it was the ... act\nWas written in fifty five do you think that the legislative history is that the members of Congress in Nineteen fifty to all the way back to what are we talking about our eyes and our the Taylor tail end you know I think it would be ... an hour at that point wouldn't it or was a true if\nThe fifty twos Truman yeah of course we have there's a general rule in in the law that where you have a language that's been used before being repeated it should be understood as having the same meaning so what that would mean as if if the Congress is language directly from the fourteenth amendment\nLisa understand the language of the Congress has used as having the same meaning as it hadn't the fourteenth amendment which gets back to what I was saying before about\nWhat the chief author and another one of the most prominent are proponents in Congress said this this phrase allergies subject to the jurisdiction there a men's and again what they said it meant was\nThat the person in question didn't ... to any foreign stage so that would not cover uh foreigners that would not cover anchor babies that would not cover birth terrorists would not cover any of these people\nKnow and in fact you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application because gives it today's practical application if a if a South Korean mom flies into Los Angeles or Seattle\nStays for a few weeks delivers a baby and goes home she likely goes home with a birth certificate from the state of California which is a sanctuary state so does that become definitive\nOf what and who that child is or is it the U.S government's policy at the time they were born the definitive because if they go home to South Korea with mom and the kid turns Eighteen and then says okay mom\nI'm headed back to America since I'm a citizen does it matter what what we said today or does it matter what the policy is Twenty years from now or Eighteen years from now when the kid comes back to America hoping to establish himself and then at some point bring six or eight of his family members with her\n[laughter] well this was the kind of question that in a law professor was given to find an uncertain terms that try to answer of course the the legal answer I think is that that doesn't matter but the practical answer is well\nI'm the president Eighteen years from now could order that he'd be given a passport so on the other hand of course\nYou think Hillary willing to leave me running Eighteen years from now [noise] I mean she's running right now I think so why not [laughter]\nWell ahead of a way I don't know that I Want to get up into those weeds\nAnd I need to

I Want you to describe depth of the nation your most recent documentary that's now out on DVD and why people should go out and get it now that is available in that form\nWell because we talk a lot about fake news but we ...\nDee Dee and why people should go out and get it now but it's available in that form\nWell because we talk a lot about fake news so we don't talk enough about snakes scholarship and fake history and steak narrative in the last makes accusations against Trump and the conservative point sample they count as a fashion\nThe Republican Party is the party of fascism behind that is that kind of meta narrative a big story and the big story is that fascism is on the right to\nAccept them as as likely to nominate it's actually the one that are right in front of the whole argument would collapse and that notion fascism as directly phenomenon has been something that left pedaled since the Nineteen forties\nThey've got it into the textbooks that got it on the History Channel\nThey got it in the wake of media and so a lot of people quote no to be true even though it's not true of fascism was never seen on the right prior to that\n... ... what we're seeing is regressive his story obviously that has been a kind of lab and all of us up for the captive in ...\nI watched the movie is try to do that of a nation is Rick you out of that law show you like history as it was actually experienced by the people who live through it in the twenties and thirties a kind of fresh look at our own American story though when you see it in the new like you'll never be the quite the pain that got\nNo in fact I think that's true of all the documentaries\nYou've done and I cite them frequently in conversations with people and say go watch this documentary and understand the real relationship historic relationship between say the United states and Mexico where our current relationship is a little bit strained\nBut some of that may go back in history but some of it was settled a long time ago in the United states I think\nActed very honorably in his relations toward a much less powerful\nA state of Mexico back in the day\nAnd and and we subtly you're your own country great uh but but then you have to be responsible for your people [noise] [noise]\nAh yes absolutely so because of the movie and I do typically a book that goes with the movie um the ... is an emotional narrative\n... it's hard for them firing the book is titled the references and folks out so it's kind of my way of putting out a one two punch and the left has not been able to poke their finger hole into the they like the big screen in general and misrepresent what out Damascus\nClaiming that Hitler was a liberal Democrat nonsense I'm not saying that it's not even remotely able that I'm saying but what I Am saying is that if you're looking for the vestiges of fascist tactics\nIn America today you would be far more likely to find them on the left and on the right\nOne in fact aren't most I mean many of the policies that are being pushed by the most radical elements of the Democratic party including or cause you a court chosen Gillum and others is lunchtime nationalized\nHealthcare let's do this you know and it's a lot of policies that they weren't the let's take over the world policies of the Hitler regime but they certainly are socialist policies and I always like to remind them ... Nazi actually stands for [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean when the part of the problems I think back\nTo fascism and not is and we think of World War two and gas\nChambers and and while those did come out of the war or with no fascism was not was not\nPortrayed like that that's not has a fascist became the largest political party both in Germany and then in\nAn orderly and Italy are they became the largest party by hand painting on government takeover of the banks and healthcare government control of education essentially government control not only of the organs of the economy but also over the lives of\nCitizens that would be molded in a kind of a single unit or ... chicken pox and if you will with leftist ideology that is what they're not the it's called like from town meaning and\nIn a sense coordination and that's what the left are trying to do in their own way in America today beat\nUs all into submission intimidate us all into that need to stay in tune in defense\nLying our own plastic I fly off the overall balconies\nIt'll be interesting to see what happens after the midterms a week from today dinners congrats on death of the nation it's now on store shelves anywhere DVDs are sold international always a pleasure to have you on trying to stir up to that is diminished as soon as a best selling author and filmmaker\n...

and it pulls out with me wearing a T shirt that says socialist tears and I have a sledgehammer and I smashed\nThe TV and I had to look really mean right while doing it but it was the hardest thing because we laugh middle of this thing is the GPS going fly at all what we did is what the left doesn't do we smashed our own property we pay for all property we didn't do it to anybody else's property you know what the brilliant part of that video was laws I didn't say a word\nAnd we did not have a gun and they still went ballistic over at no guns those speech nothing and of course they said we were being violent were not being violent we were just acting out what everybody wants to do they want to smash their TV when they're tired of being hammered over the head with nonsense every night\nI'm Talking to ... uh hosted in or a TV you know one thing that bothers me grant the fake news doesn't all have to come in statements of of of on true facts\nIt can also come by omission and you know when I heard about the shooting a synagogue on Saturday I was following Twitter and I thought oh my God this is horrible I said a prayer for those people but I also thought about my friend John ... who runs a crime prevention Research Center\nWho points out that Ninety eight percent of all the mass shootings in American I'm tired of hearing about them to I Want them to stop but they happen in gun free zones\nNow I I didn't do a full catalogue of what network news did but I'm willing to bet the not a single one mentioned these mass shootings happened in places that are disarmed\nAnd then make the very simple point\nShe I mean if a reporter at a network I ever had the inclination say how do we protect the important stuff and he ... he or she just\nWent through state and say well I went to a ball game at a stadium the other day and there were armed cops or guards there I went to a shopping mall armed guards the building I mean right now armed guards most banks aren't you know go right down the list\nLots and lots of places the important places are protected by that well\nI've always thought the schools in houses of worship should be protected as well not by government edict but voluntarily then when you decide not to do that it's like me deciding not to wear my seatbelt I'm not blaming the victim I'm just saying I wear my seatbelt even though I've never had a seatbelt saved me from Syria's arm but also where a gun every day even though I've never had that\nSaved me from serious harm yet\nThat that's right but you never know when\nIt's going to happen you never know what you're going to get a car accident you'd never know if you're going to get the gun site if you will comes calling and so I'm with you I mean my goal is to empower every single person that wants to carry a firearm law in a law abiding fashion to have\nThe right to do so so many places are trying to take away that way but that's all the second amendment is about is protecting yourself and your family\nSo you have a right to do that and as soon as the liberals could realized the second amendment as elders record is called on it is not going away anytime soon the quicker they need to get over the hurdles of of trying to live in the status of the world was somehow evil doesn't doesn't exist\nThe way and anytime soon the quicker they need to get over the hurdles are trying to live in the fantasy world we're still now evil doesn't doesn't exist and so I'm with you about the line by omission done sleep zones are dangerous and you can see this in every\nSingle loose story that you either read or see on TV it's what they don't tell\nYou in the story that is really is really the or the ...\nThe dog is that's the dog doesn't bark watch her grandson field on ...

Rachel boulevard is the senior policy director for conservative partnerships Institute and the former director of policy services for the Heritage Foundation Rachel good to have you back on the program\nHi there thanks for having me\nSo how do we go about maybe if we can stop this caravan what can we do to get the rest of the caravans that might follow it on a regular basis stopped so that they don't challenge our national sovereignty and tried to come into across our border illegally\nWell I think the first thing that has to happen as a resource thing at the border I just really congressional question you know President Trump has spent a\nThousand troops at the border and that's great and that'll buy you know I think some of the issue is we don't have enough catches in order to pass that old and we certainly don't have enough resources in terms of border security an order patrol at the border and we don't have the president's border wall so all of that\nHas to be funded by Congress any ... here I mean it's like\nKnow I saw a number today that says that the birds to illegal alien parents in this country that are primarily covered by Medicaid and public funding through hospitals in such\n... that total amount of money that we spend a every year is greater than the amount of money they're talking about to start building the wall so it's good to me it would be a fairly easy economics choice would you rather have a wall and stop people from coming into the country illegally or would you rather just leave the border open a lot of people come in and and\nJoyce would you rather have a wall and stop people from coming into the country illegally or would you rather just leave the border opened a lot of people come in and and have babies and we'll we'll ... we'll pay for all the costs are I Would rather they didn't even get to the other side of the border um but I Want to stop them legally and who mainly but I don't even want him to stand\nIn front of a judge I I Want them to be stopped before they get to the borders there is there any hope of that Rachel\nWell I think for that to happen we have to clean up our asylum laws because right now that but then if I think a lot of these people to come here and if you listen to the interviews with people in the care of and that is what they had you become an acclaimed a silent and now there are legitimate asylum claim but right now\nBecause of changes at the Obama administration made people can claim what's called credible fear and\nThat's a very low threshold for asylum because we don't have\nThe resources at the border to hold everyone uh we we take their asylum claim and then we release them\nInto the interior of the country and they're given a court date sometimes\nYears later which many ... do not ever show for and then they're here illegally and that is what many what's attracting I think a lot of these people in the caravan is the idea they know they can come claim asylum and the lead into the country and they never have to show again we need just those laws up before anyone is going to turn in the future\nYeah because right now they know they know that the process we've we've tied ourselves up with all this bureaucracy saying yes we have a border but if you managed to get across to you have full constitutional rights we have\nTo give you an order to appear we don't have a lot of judges so that's going to take months we can't lock you up for months there's another court decision that says we can only hold you for a certain period of time so people know there'll be catch and release on the north side of the border and then they just disappear\nAnd if they don't show up for their court hearing there's not much enforcement there because many of the big cities they disappear into our sanctuary cities that say we're not going to help ice enforce the law\nSo we've strangled our society by writing a stack of laws that work against enforcement of the border instead of four enforce the border\nYeah I think that's right and that's honestly what's incentivizing a lot of people to come here on our the fact that we have is the loopholes we have these centuries cities we have all these things are\nThey know they just have to get into the country and they'll likely to be able to stay and that's a huge incentive for people to point out you know that's not just the threat obviously to our security and our sovereignty but it's a threat to people as\nThey come and I think that's what's so frustrating you know the mainstream media ignores the caravan but they also ignore the huge humanitarian crisis that exist within a legal immigration you have\nDrug traffickers is sex traffickers who pray on these people are so it's not just changing the laws for our benefit it's changing lives up for for the ... for the benefit of people who come here and math and and are exploited\nYou know as we began this conversation Rachel and made mentioned in the sun but I played a few minutes ago where a Fox News reporter drift Jenkins talked to one of the people in the current events and the guy\nUh freely and easily said yeah I'm a I'm a a third class or the third degree felony because I was convicted of attempted murder in the United states and I'm coming north so I can ask\nFor a pardon and you know I wouldn't put money on [laughter] but but that's amazing that that there are people in that group who are so concerned about their own criminal act\nThey say yeah I'm a felon I tried to murder somebody and I was convicted of it and then they kicked me out of the country and now I'm coming right back in I Would think that would scare the daylights out of Americans who've been told by Donald Trump that like it or not the crowd of illegal aliens who come into illegally\nContains a disproportionate number of\nPeople who are violent criminals and\nThen they're told by the mainstream media all that's that's a bunch of bologna Trump does know talking about well the fact is I've looked at the the stats in my own state and found that it's absolutely backed up\nA you know she's Oregon is a very blue state where we ever broadcast studios and a Eighteen percent of the convicted rapist and the state are illegal aliens and fourteen percent of the convicted murderers or illegal aliens even though\nThe percentage of illegal aliens and the state might be three or four percent at most but they they are vastly over represented in the crowd of killers and rape is\nLook we have a problem with criminals coming here as illegal aliens and the first place to look at things ... because we aren't doing the proper vetting we aren't doing the proper enforcement that would be I think we move a lot of those people\nI think Americans largely are welcoming to immigrants that come here legally but I was living here illegally yeah we can't that you we can't do any of the take any of the measures necessary to make sure of security and that's why I think you know you have people taking advantage of the lack\nSystem because they know they know they're they're as permanent as they can come here and be protected and I thought they doubt backwards in any\nCase for Rachel assuming\nAnd as you have the lack system because they know they know they're ... it's been middle they can come here and be protected and I thought they'd out backwards in any\nCase for Rachel assuming the Republicans get a decent result of next Tuesday's election assume that Republicans maintain control perhaps even gain some seats in the Senate but at least being getting control of both houses of Congress\nCan we actually get something done because you've got powerful forces working against the president like house Speaker Paul Ryan who didn't wait ten seconds today\nBefore he jumped out and condemned Trump's idea of re interpreting the fourteenth amendment which is not a change in the laws Naga not anything outrageous are extraordinary just showing we've been misinterpreting ... and the first thing Paul Ryan who think God can't be gone sooner enough\nFor my money uh he uh he comes out and immediately says it's not possible it's not true and it's not going to happen\nSo can we get something done if we maintain control of the Congress\nWell look I think if a Republicans maintain control they absolutely have to get them done I mean not in a band aid that voters of immigration is still one of the top issues on the minds of voters get a Gallup poll a July show that it was the top issue on the minds of voters\nBiggest developed history in terms of identification that I think something but I Do think even before a January Republicans in Congress come back in December and have to vote on a funding package even before they the new Congress get sworn in that it may be their last chance to just on Trump's order well\nWithout evidence they they voted that the cap down\nActually doctor can do and maybe this is too blonde but I'm going to say it anyway\nI don't care for conventional schools could hurt and here's why what I mean by that is if you have schools successful or failing schools that do you know the the uh then they have some competition in the form of a charter school than the parents\nLook at what the charter schools doing for their kids and they look at what the conventional schools doing\nAnd they move either a sizable minority or even a majority of their students from the conventional school to the charter school because they now have a choice\nAnd they say just school is doing for my kids what I Need which was to give them a good solid education and the conventional school says hey we used to be of a a thousand kids here now we only have five hundred to weaken only just try half\nThe staff and a half the teachers because the resources have gone across the street to the charter school that's okay you know and and\nI and I wonder why you know you're in a part of the country\nThat has a lot of liberals but but it's also read their businesses that are run most people who are you know not government workers are government workers are not the majority thank God would look at it and say well if my company does a better job than the competition the competition may lose business or even go out of business so what\nThat is how you breed excellence or in in any field in education in business in almost anything your competition breeds excellence but competition usually means somebody wins\nAnd I mean somebody has to lose why are people so concerned about saying oh we have to preserve this whole model that has been disturbing are cute\nWell I I agree with you completely that the old model is not something\nThat should be preserved and charter schools here for example are closing achievement gaps for are low income children of color especially at a rate unprecedented in this nation I Would say that one of the places where not only Massachusetts gets it wrong but so many states get it wrong is that we have this cap\nOn the number of schools that can exist so the reason they care about uh what how the district school they're performing for example is that not everybody has access to a charter public schools so here in the commonwealth we're twenty six thousand\nIndividual kids on the list to get into these high performing charter public school if there weren't that cap I Would agree with you completely let the let the charter schools do what they know how to do closed them when they don't do it well and if the traditional public schools don't fare well in that system than they too should close unfortunately\nI'm In too many places in the country as we do in Massachusetts we had the charter school cast which means that\nEven when families want to leave their district schools make him well and that's the problem\nI guess what I'm Wondering is why were the voters the taxpayers the parent willing to tolerate a cap\nIf if you said these schools are going to be great and clearly if the legislature and the people who voted in favor of of having charter schools to be made available it must be because they believe there is at least as good if not better than conventional schools why would you say this is going to be really great but you can only have\nAnd it ... must be because they believe there is at least as good if not better than conventional schools why would you say this is going to be really great but you can only have a little bit of\n... well I think it's because believe me I I Wish that we would have a much more of\nThat um that aggressively you know what we've got here is special interest groups that have a huge old on the politics of education and that said that they do and many others and part of the ... is what we had failed to talk about it here in the complete abolition that the cap and said\nWe may feel that day over time let's raise an ear let's raise it there and so in that context you're always going to be vulnerable to the argument well every time you open a charter school in this community of that\nCommunity it's going to drain funding from the traditional public school which by the way even true here because I'm with ya and it and it and then it somewhere as it should I Believe money follows the child is for the child\nAnd not for the bureaucracy or not or the school not for the adult then that would that would work but unfortunately here to stay in the context of the cap\nIt it's not not work\nBy the way can I ask a detailed question about charters is not bad detailed but in a lot of states charters good eighty percent of the money that a convention or does that also true in Massachusetts\nIt's not um I Would add that even when charters nationally get less funding than traditional public schools they still tend to outperform them and now comes a hearing Massachusetts we actually believe it or not having them for charter school funding where the money for charter schools followed the child which means that\nUm when I when a kid and you know what I don't want this district school I'm going to go to a charter is dead and money that is due to him or her go directly to the charters there was actually\nAt one of the most equitable officers that Sunday in in the whole nation of course we don't get equal facilities accounting which means that we are to get that because\nOur charter school operators either have to raise money to put a roof over kids' heads or get back to the money that they could use for operating school but we still manage to even with less money outperform proving that throwing money at education isn't always the answer is has not answered all\nDr ...

not the big gotcha issue that uh that uh medical care for\nAll would I I guess I Would I guess I Would look at this and and say I my I guess my point was will the Democrats took the house would they would tempt to divide the executive branch from the Senate\nBy coming up with things that they believe the president would like that the Senate Republicans would not want well here's an here's an end to try to put a wedge going into twenty twenty okay with the president criticizing the Senate as you get as you're heading towards twenty twenty so your ultimate play here is what\nI mean the Democrats clearly want they want the the the Senate the house and\nThe White House [noise] so in\nPlaying the president against the Senate it's all about you know if if they would want to get something done you know for the sake of getting it done you know what I mean having something look we've ... we've accomplished we got this done we can get a lot more done if we get the Senate the White House\nAh so I guess there's that possibility open that up and and it would be a good play have the president has said he would support this and this and this and this is what we're supporting we're showing bipartisanship\n[laughter] some bipartisan by by willing\nTo work with the president that he's on something he's already clearly stated he ... he supports the only problem right now is the Republicans in the Senate\nBy the way I while I Know no I I was I was just thinking whoever runs for the Democrats that the the the model for the Democrats in twenty twenty is bipartisanship and civility no I mean\nI think they are going to try and pretend that and what what do you do [noise] you flowed out some some things that infrastructure not but it's a small thing but it's not one of those hot button issues so if you'd float something I don't know that it will be infrastructure but ... you say\nThat look we know the president's supports a investments and I hate that word investment in an infrastructure or a and\nHe said that before and was not able to get it done when his side control the house now we're controlling and we're willing to work with him\nExcept the

take out the presidency because that\nYou have lawsuits all the time card you know a filed against you as a president ... yeah let's get it but just take the business law suits but I Would also like

will get you huge lawyer fees as George Papadopoulos yeah added Carter Page and these were on pay\nThe ... campaign people I Wonder what their lawyer for use of bed right\n\nA campaign people I Wonder what their lawyer for usa bed right\n\nLeft amazing I've been feeling Papadopoulos is going to write a book on this if it's true what he's dating\nAnd yesterday you had to leave a little early to go to a conference and and we talked about this the Papadopoulos coming on the ... the the tweet saying by the way Congress knows who's a spy was in the campaign so do I can't I Can't tell you\nBut he's also said that he made he may reverse his play\nFrom what he learned in okay\nProbably as we are and the question about are about the whole Michael Flynn thing now again we're talking about you know those those are separate charges\nBut ... ...\n... and and this this whole thing if there is the the basis of a ... if the very basis of all of it\nWas about the uh the spy on the campaign the uh the the ill gotten possibly Pfizer warrant\nAnd all of that if everything stemmed from the ... of what we're looking at with Papadopoulos a Michael Flynn if if the if the fact of the matter is is that they were on to Michael Flynn because of that we don't know we have no idea but if that were the case\nWhich means that would be no basis for those investigators to be talking to Michael Flynn which means\nThey shouldn't have been there and the charges would be dropped now we we have no idea because he's his hearing a sentencing hearing is coming up here and\nI'm In a matter of weeks now what five or six weeks away\nWell but the question is why was delayed by a special prosecutor why did why did Mohler agree to lay not once but multiple times the sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn then you add to it Papadopoulos and then add\nTo it at the White House handed\nTo inspector general's office at the department of justice all of that from the Pfizer warrant a situation and turned it over to here's Laura which knowing and and we\nHad been pointing there's nobody has been asking this question ... outside of that I Know of\nWhy would you send it to the inspector general because you believe something internally was was some kind of wrongdoing ... after the department of justice haven't hears and the way to find that out is through a proper I'd investigate noble what I'm what I'm thinking\nIs Papadopoulos the reason he said that\nIn any said first off that you know I I I may take away that guilty plea for line ... ... if you live your life will possibly get you out of that how could it and he said not necessary to get it reverse but just to bring forth what happened\nAnd I started thinking okay and then you start talking about the spy the only thing I could think of is\nThe spy was somebody who actually was\nNot an operative for the Democrats but somebody from law enforcement who was put there because it all relates to the Carter page warrant right which was illegally got across the board and not only would could have possibly affect the Michael Flynn case because if\nThe warrant was illegally gotten than anything that comes from it mhm is tainted every ... every single ... everything and that's what I'm thinking so they got the warns in part of the war was once they justify the warranted law enforcement plus\nRight somebody in law enforcement that kind of in a ... or an informant that were maybe not an FBI person but an informant ... at the FBI put in there you know that just to\nTo look at Papadopoulos and it was all based on the information that they had gotten from the ... and the war and and everything is interconnected with the\nBuys a war\nAnd so everything around it as tainted and that's what\nHe feels can possibly get him off on that\nOr at least X pose what was going on there where the prosecution eventually just says okay the the you know that you're guilty plea is is waived or whatever because it looks so bad for the FBI and the department of justice look something's going on here when when the president said\nWell a lot of this was top secret in our allies would rather us not release it so I'm going to give it to the inspector general to review you and I both said it doesn't make any sense\nDoesn't make any sense at all because you're not looking you that's not what you do you're not talking about the national security advisor you're not talking about the uh the the uh\nBecause you're not looking you that's not what you do you're not talking about the national security advisor you're not talking about the uh\nThe the uh the secretary of state you're talking about the I. G. of the department of justice and the entire role the entire reason that the IGA exists is to investigate wrong to wrongdoing inside the department of justice\nAnd corruption yes and the only thing we can think of as they believe that after\nThey declassified it and those emails back and forth and text messages between the FBI and the department of justice what they found was the corruption that they believe\nWill take down the entire case I Can't think of anything else what else could possibly be the inspector general does not care\nHe just not review top secret material\n\nThat's and knowing that the idea would have access to anything and everything that he wanted to access inside the department of justice\nYou actually have a better investigative tools and Congress just eight six six Ninety red eye\nIs engine report is brought you by Detroit\n...

North Carolina\n... idea like that [noise]\nThat's right ... more than ten thousand people have left Connecticut for North Carolina and I just uh [noise] I just hope that we can get ourselves back to where we should be ... and I know that many of you [noise]\nFeel the ... the same way and you would like to call me and give me some of your thoughts are up please please do ... ... poll they've got a another another a poll out that a\n... a voter turnout key to win this is what the experts say and uh people are saying that it is going to be a large a large\nTurnout [noise] and we'll uh [noise]\nAll the counting with you yes absolutely but it's one of those times it's one of those times when it is so important that we get the right folks\nThat we get the right folks in an office in by the way\nWe're going to take your calls in just a just a few minutes I'd love to hear from some of the uh uh early folks who who listen to it is in the morning and get some of your your reasons why are you are up for certain\nFor certain candidates\n... but it's going to be it's going to be a close one no no question no question about it\nBut it's going to be it's gonna be a close one no no question no question about it and I uh am looking looking forward to it and I do think and I really do think of my friends that it's\nGoing to be probably probably one of the biggest turnouts we've had in years\nAnd the reason I say that is because I've talked to an awful lot of people and they are ready for a change there's no no question about it so uh again we'll have to wait and see\nWhat the other candidates are are going at each other no question about it and uh I think that uh Bob ...\nWould make a tremendous tremendous governor I truly truly do\nAnd he's the kind of guy that uh if he gets into it he's going to do what he feels is best for Connecticut and he's not going to be worried about to be reelected again or anything like that and that's what I like about him too\nAnd that's what I like about him too so uh uh we'll see\nWe'll see just how it's all going to work and as far as the United States Senate is concerned US Senator Chris Murphy who is running for a second term maintains a large lead over his Republican opponent\nMatthew Corey of Manchester according to a a yesterday she told me he is a had fifty six percent to forty one percent among likely voters clearly\nThere's a a some a ticket splitting\nA because uh Murphy is is doing a much better\nThan Lamont much better than than law bought the polar\nSurveyed one thousand two hundred and one likely voters from October twenty second until the twenty eight through the twenty eighth\nWith a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points so that's ah that's it and again in a few minutes we will be opening up the owners for you if any of you I'd love to hear from you early Rogers\nTo see just how you feel this morning and uh if you can give me a ... give me a call\nNow a ... a campaign liar sent out to constituents has been flag that\nBy Democrats and others as being anti Semitic or the mailer was sent out by Republican state Senate candidate ad Sharma out against a Democrat\nMatt Lesser and the flyer shows candidate lesser who is a Jewish holding cash\nIn his hands reaction poured in quickly on Tuesday calling it anti Semitic I had heard about it I didn't believe that it could possibly be true and then I saw the flyer\nAnd I thought to be honest never in a million years that I expect to see something like that or not in Connecticut this is what the lesser sad that the ... definite Defamation League blasted the ad\nAnd a Jewish Quinnipiac philosophy professor\nAlso I've said it was just harmful and I you know\nThis is something this is something that I just can't understand\nThis happening during really the the entire campaign in and out or postcards were mailed to residents in Middletown weather's field knowing ... Cromwell and rocky hill the chairman for the Connecticut Republican Party\nJ. R. Romano a ... said that ah it certainly was an appropriate I I just don't know why why would anybody\nDo something like this just incredible just an incredible you know something uh\nDo something like this just incredible just in a credible you know something a Eric this particular campaign\nThis particular campaign has had some terrible things that have happened and\nThis is one of them absolutely bread I mean I get that I Do get what they're getting it with the whole money in the hands thing but you gotta be careful especially when\nYou do talk about stereotypes and stuff like that um yeah absolutely I mean one wrong move and it will sink a campaign or probably one of the best examples remember Howard Dean a few years and ten years ago I sure do he made one of the biggest mistake when he got to over excited\nAnd it turned into a soundbite that sunk his campaign for the presidency I mean\nThere's no telling if he would've beaten Bush but at the same time you have to be careful with your actions and your words and that he just ... in the situation\nWell we'll see and up by the way we can take your calls we can take your calls now some of your early rise years\nIf you are ...

John Gotti junior these guys in New York and Chicago and Al Capone reverse these guys are so present are out of the ... the clothes all in the ... for\nThree or four or five thousand dollars to see and then they also in the areas where they're living in a help although ...\nIn those areas where there's the fascination because they try to be these benevolent sort of guy I mean for years Brad use all the stories where you know the feds and the local guys for example in New York\nYou know they knew how bad of a guy John Gotti was but yet if you went to the I think it was in Queens\nWhere his neighborhood oh my God what are you kidding he keeps the streets save a they talked about that big that big fourth of July fireworks he used all he's a great American look at the fireworks he does a yeah I mean people in his neighborhood they now Johns ...\nHe's in the ... he always said using the plumbing business and the problem is is that a ... they say they're either in their in their in the plumbing business bread or or or the written the refuse business trash\nRemoval [laughter] oh my God so anyway but I've always been as they really like this morning yeah yeah grab that paper yeah let's forget the sports you're going right wing is\nBad I think people were you know there's two categories of people to result we've always been fascinated with gangsters and Hollywood people think about you know over the years not so much now although it is with social media and some of these other shows but\nYou know taxes and not really doing what the state needs and the hard way but um I I just you know if you held a gun to my head today I Would\nYou know taxes and not really doing what the state needs and the hard way but\nUm I I just you know if you held a gun to my head today I Would I Would have to say Ned Lamont and barely but you know the only thing the other thing that being in a bread and I were talking about you've seen this in the polls is that you know some of these polls Lee you see the late breakers are breaking towards ... which is interesting\nI think you you're probably both right I mean that's exactly where I Am it is where you are because\nI Am certainly not for none of them on I think being a you know in office for another four years would be\nDoubling down I'm a lawyer and I don't think anybody wants that at all or at least at least ... people that are saying don't want another four years of of ... and I again I just don't know if there are enough\nReady fired up Republicans to go out and for you know vote for Bob stuff and I ask you because there are more Democrats in the state so you know they they start with that advantage right away\nYeah yeah but you know one leaves I've heard I've heard I've been out there and I've heard that I've had people come up to me I'm a Democrat and this is what I'm going to do and they and they and they mentioned stepping out good good I'm Glad about\nAnd you know a lot of those Democrats Brad refers to you know ... are in your district or in the second district and I've had people tell me at the Capitol other people I Know that you know you know are in the middle of the campaign apparatus here they have said and you've probably heard from these guys and gals on your show\nThat the gangs the general assembly the Republicans made the general assembly last two cycles over taxes over anger what some of the post Newtown gun laws a lot of those games come from came from conservative in centrist Democrats as well\nI I think you're probably exactly right and I and I actually started to show up today and let me\nLet me know what you guys think about this you know where we go clearly where we go here in the state of Connecticut whether it's you know red or blue hopefully we get we had a couple more seats in in the house yeah certainly if there is something you know if we can ever get the Senate I mean giving ... Center for San do\nA lot more Jews to to push through it would be huge but across the country\nYou know we're going to get a really good idea of where everybody actually is unsure Trump's right right I mean because you were as we're kind of up in the air like yeah something like the real Trump supporters love them no matter what but there there are people out there who can't stand them so this is going to tell us it's going to go a long way to tell you actually how the country feels about\nOur and look at Lee and look at how he is being used particularly in this in this state\nFor example in the attorney general's race where you have sue Hatfield who is an eminently qualified woman to be attorney general William Caldwell Democrat and every other word out of his mouth is Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump it's like can you talk to me about what you would do as attorney general in Connecticut know Trump Trump Trump Trump to oh my\nGod I could not agree with you more let me ask you guys both watch that debate last night I watched just a few minutes ago I 'cause I I wanted to ask you if\nYou thought that the questions or at least the the general question the theme of that debate was fair to Bob I don't think it was I thought those questions were geared to make them look good\nWell and again if you yeah and only saw just a couple of minutes of ...

own prospects correct exactly Lucia Hi\nFrom the you have these you know you have a better voice anywhere [laughter] I never let her boys [laughter] so\nFrom inform Connecticut our friend or listen to Jong is here another new survey from the research and Policy Institute of Connecticut what's the deal here Alyssa with what Connecticut residents are worried about and are not worried about\nIt that we we conduct its quarterly survey and we've been giving it to the past\nFour years and we asked residents across the state what they think about a current the current economic situation what they think it's going to look like six months from now or into the future and then we also asked questions about their own personal finances\nAnd so what we found was that people are feeling a little bit more about the overall economy and they're kind of long term a mantle situation\nWell I'll tell you something right now we got a lot of work ahead of its though a lot of work out of\nThat for sure and then what we found which was really interesting is that people are concerned about their short term personal finance you know feeling it you know we're starting to see the interest rate increase and so people are really taking a step back\nBefore they make that next car purchase or\nYou know dive into a new home and and things like that people are more concerned now than we are going on in the past four years of doing this survey about kind of short term initial conditions\nAnd I do notice here that you do take a look at MIT trips you measure this by things like am I going to go on vacation am I going to buy a new car versus a used car what am I doing in the short term because that's you know people react ride to listen to how much money they have or don't have in their pockets right\nExactly and that we're seeing you know lower lower percentage of people taking a a really big vacation or\nMaking a big uh what we call it the terrible purchase for something like buying a nice piece of furniture or um or purchase on your car or refinancing or buying a home those level those percentages were all much lower um but we've seen in quarters\nSee that's why I'm a used furniture I just sit on boxes that [laughter]\nYou know one of the what are the things too\nSee that's why I Am a used furniture I just sit on boxes that this [laughter]\nYou know one of the what are the things too and ah I I\nThink you'll go along with the with the two of us on this but we have some very big problems in this state and unfortunately\nDon't talk about them and I think once we can and once we can go through it all that we can come up with a solution that will work that's one of the big things that I worry about all the time I really truly truly do I think that's what we're going to need\nI I totally agree with that I really love that\nYou know the next the next governor and legislature are really going to have to think about what the priorities are for eight and then figure out how to on them because the process now isn't it not working and I will and we need to make it more efficient or that that we have our budget\nHowever finally Elizabeth one one a good point here is that people seem to be a little more optimistic your survey found that\nFifty four percent of say residents say it's a good place to live in Connecticut to raise a family twenty four percent disagree that says thirty four ... that's a thirty percent gap but that's up from a twenty percent gap a year ago so you know as I always say and people ask me out of state when I work in my\nOther jobs what's wrong with Connecticut I say there's really nothing wrong with Connecticut so beautifully say we have\n... we have a little problem with the decisions that are being made and who's running it\nAnd we have a little problem with spending too much money just because you've got the money\nExactly to think about yeah exactly we have to think about what our priorities are what we want to spend our money on ... where we are a relatively affluent and we had so many so many things going ... uh but we have to figure out how to how to pay for that and a long term\nElicit does yong from inform Connecticut the research and Policy Institute of Connecticut Alyssa thank you appreciate it\nMust have a great day\nBy by now see here's you know and I knew this from the get go I like you know I respect Mr Lamont alive Mr seven ... if you and I had declared for governor and lieutenant governor\nWe'd have we'd have it all ... we we would have we'd have policies in place\nAt some yes whether charging the

approached twice really can I ask her can ask for OK okay burning district first district okay ... to give it a thought about that kind of a thought no no\nThat was it you know I've known people who run for office statewide Congress wise I even had somebody kind of allude to me ones would you be interested in\nThe state house and for me bread I don't know about you for me and this is what I've heard from people who have run and campaigns I've worked for the past few years\nThey've all say it's it's I Do not have the capacity of bread maybe you do other people do or don't [noise]\nI Would have a very tough time asking people for money [noise] you know the fundraising thing oh and we hear what you want to hear about it all the time right you know the fundraising thing how much money you have to raise how much money to we have I I just I had a friend of mine warned me he goes don't get into it if you're a squeamish\nAbout getting on the phone and saying you know or whatever you could

to raise this and a ... tomorrow night we will may ... you know promoted and and that's that's how you can raise a lot of money ... interesting people\nDo not I think that you are raising it for

issues you have to ask questions with real specificity because again most people are busier their lives they don't really know what this means birthright citizenship\nBut then when people find out about it because Trump talks about like what four hundred thousand people are born in the United states to illegal immigrants every year and it costs four point three billion dollars in taxpayer dollars to educate them\nAnd to give other federal benefits healthcare and so forth people are just like to watch I think it's outrageous most people including in one of the most hotly contested

outside money coming in\nThe fight of his life Matt Rosendale is with us or this race is very close a record amount of outside money coming in to this race just over the past week another six million and outside money poured into the contest just sort of the last seven days making it\nA according to the uh independent record in Montana it's making it basically one of the most expensive races in the United states and uh we're delighted that matched with us now Matt how are you how's it going out there\n... it's good to be with you again lower\nUh Matt this is a Montana obviously is a massive state it's a lot of ground to cover so you have to you have to pick your if your places where you go but it would seem to me that the way the American media have\nAttempted to demonize Donald Trump just on the in the last a week or so with these horrible attacks and and on the issue of immigration I don't see Montanans buying that demonization and trying to connect you with that I really don't\nThey John and I'm very proud to stand with the president his policies lore we've had him out here three times\nAnd the president will be up coming to Bozeman again this Saturday at twelve thirty or to join us again for yet another rally and I and I'm thrilled that he's doing so you know his his policies of\nTax cuts and trying to secure our southern border and reducing regulation and getting these trade agreements employees um has been very very good for the state of Montana\nAnd and the people embrace those policies and they would like to send someone to Washington to help the president accomplished more\nI mean if we can get this much done and the last ah twenty months with with a Congress that has not always been cooperative and certainly the Democrats have been as much of a ...\nTruck shift as they possibly can goodness what can we accomplished in the next couple of years\nOr how much in a way of of lobbyists um money has test or taking in during his time in the Senate ...\n... this is this is one of the things that demonstrate just tell for from Montana Jon Tester is gone he is the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyist in the country five hundred and thirty five members of Congress we have one million people here\nAnd he has received more contributions lobbyist than any other a member of over one million dollars over one million dollars and why is that he stood on stage twelve years ago and said he wouldn't be encumbered\nBy special interests and now he's the number one recipient he literally bought a house with a million dollar high in the Washington DC\nAnd left Montana and his rearview mirror\nWell again Montanans are very smart pragmatic no nonsense people and I think Jon Tester talked a good game when he ran and kind of looks like a burly guy and he\nHas put this plaid shirt on and then he comes to Washington\nAnd it just becomes one of the ... monsters in Washington DC and he wants to he wants to continue the big spending ways\nOf the Democratic party and my friends are Matt Rosendale gotta win this Saturday is going to be of great rally in Bozeman with the president Matt a best of luck in these final

out as her party a leader she's in her last term are clearly opposition forces in Germany more populist uh anti migration\nLower so far the German government has not changed his position that still wants to stay inside of the Jaycee peel away\nBut nearly every German company folks with real money at risk made the opposite decision they have fled they have left they decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will ...\nLaugh they decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise] and there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I am convinced that over time all of the European countries will come to see\nIf the ... is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that the ...\nOr so the sanctions gun place on Monday correct\nYes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them immediately will it take a little time to settle on\nUs or are there are already feeling with him but a mess the days go on a pressure will increase we will substantially dropped the amount of crew to all their primary revenue source that they could ship around the world a treasury will put back in place sanctions on financial institutions there [noise]\nAnd we hope that the things we put on individuals and in other places will convince the leadership we we walk the rating people to be successful we want this to be a successful country we want to restore democracy that we we think the Iranian people want that same thing as\nOur aim is or not to harm the Iranian people but to change the behavior the malign activity of this regime\nAre just going back to Germany a boy have Merkel's fortunes changed obviously she'll be finishing up her last term but she's been there for Thirteen Years or so\nUh and uh she's leaving as a head of her party well how would that change our dealings with Germany in the in the near term and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of solving any and the challenges that you is facing\nSo many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some were um we don't share the same view the president has been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that\nThe primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia crates um [noise] uh reside in Europe not in America [noise]\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluate system sees that America is with them were happy to assess them but they have the primary responsibility we hope that each of these governments will come

inspectors are what can you tell us about I Know you're going to go meet with your not North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that when I was with chairman Kim now or three weeks three and a half weeks ago [noise]\nUm he committed to allowing American inspectors to come look at a two significant sites and we hope to uh get them there before too long it's one of the things I'll speak with my counterpart next week about and then we do have the intention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together\nBefore too long hopefully early in the next year where we can make\nA substantial breakthrough in taking down the nuclear threat from North Korea um [noise] we're we're still a happy that they haven't conducted a nuclear test in an awfully long time they have launched a missile in an awfully long time but there's a lot of work which remains\nAnd chairman Kim has made clear to me it just as plain as a I was speaking to lower the he has the attention to the new could arise and we do everything we can to system in following through on that come out of it\nI Want to move to China and Mr Secretary because all we've seen in in recent weeks nothing that's surprising to to you or me because we've been following this issue of Chinese\nOr stealing

critical technology and manufacturing aviation uh and so forth and now we have this chipmaker ban are in place on that ...\nGarner and a lot of um attention on it's trying to I guess we're trying to target that stayed on a chip maker in China over national security concerns or how how is that going to fit into our overall a\nAggressive stance against this expansive on Chinese a behemoth\nA China is probably over the long term the biggest challenge ... challenge that faces our country I saw the indictments of of ten Chinese versus for the\nUh the alleged theft of intellectual property aviation related intellectual property this is a story that's been going on for years this is the first administration\nThe alleged theft of intellectual property aviation related intellectual property this was a story that's been going on for years this was the first administration that has been prepared to push back against China\nAnd we're doing so on all fronts so where the semi conductor beef it's

and try to uh were very worried that China will put the people in many countries around the world with African Central America Latin America [noise]\nA in a death trap or that will cause those countries decades of pain a is a multi pronged effort on behalf of all of the United states government at the president's direction to convince try to\nUh to behave like a normal day Sheila commerce and with respect to the rules of international law\nNow I mean I Know you have to Mr Secretary but just as some people understand that our trade policy or with China has had real effect inside China they're already have structural a weaknesses\nWithin a China large but they had the weakest manufacturing growth and more than two years in China a and that the one has a a slid a manufacturing stalls are and they and their ambitions as a result had been affected but they're still lofty\nA and we ... we do finally have an administration who's now who who's seen this with eyes wide open a Mr

Claritin illegals\nAnd providing a a you know sanctuary ... a sanctuary status to illegal alien criminals now that's what's bringing all these people in ... I just heard a report about the caravans why are those people thinking they can come here\nBecause we've got political people like my opponent or giving them offering them jobs benefits\nAnd offering them a treasure house if they'll just come here even if it's legally\nWell let's just earlier this year when Orange County\nA and it's that love song la city council voted to oppose the sanctuary state law that of course supported by a\nGovernor among game and all the lefty that has made your state a magnet for illegal immigrants and now the push to get health care or to illegal immigrants after we find out that the cost to the state of California the legal immigration including any taxes they pay\nTwenty three billion dollars a year congressman twenty three billion\nRight well we have to take a walk her what's really going on and obviously\nWe have some people who either are really a ignorant or they are intentionally a critic these facts are systems in the process of going out our quality of life in California is purely being attacked\nBy this massive Paul marketing legals that dimension that that's part of the labels of course some of them are criminals but even those that aren't we can't afford to spend limited dollars on our educate our education system from for the last twenty or Thirty years has gone for one of the best one of the worst\nAnd uh we'll just have said we cannot afford to take care of everybody in the coal to get here and if we do it's a crime against our own people\nA congressman or our back or the ... is the sad thing I think for so many Americans is how it's become a point of controversy for you to say or any of us to say we want the border and forced why is that controversial that we want a border\n[noise] uh that uh we're gonna have to come to grips with the American people uh I Hope or are observing this trying to figure out what's going to happen with their lives as the situation deteriorates I\nHaving columns people and these are this or that you believe that I Know they called them the caravans but these are columns of feeders coming to dark country now admittedly most are probably good people below significant number are probably criminals\nAnd no matter what it is we can't afford to have these massive numbers of people if we let them through this time and uh I I'm I have faith that are for us to stop this invasion of our country\nAnd if we let them in this time I work we get a check more and more and more just like we have individually as we let them across the border we now have probably one of these for thirty billion the illegals here\nOr are you being outspent significantly on the ... in the ad wars in other outreach to voters getting in to the polls are online social media and so forth\nBullets there's the irony of all of this of course we're being called because of our positions like on the legal immigration were being called the establishment Republicans are the heart of the rich are breathing told but we've got these billionaires ... money and I get I\nOr the party of the rich are breeding told but we've got these billionaires point money and I get my opponent's campaign\nAnd into all of the uh how you say a combat or a hall of the districts that are in combat between Republican\nAnd Democrat their ... their point in the big guys are pouring\nMillions and ... hundreds of billions of dollars across the country\nMillions and billions in in my district so it's difficult because uh I I Am not very wealthy man my opponent a is a healthy person and they came here he's only been in California about six or seven years here are they from his dad came out of the year\nWhile I don't have the personal any that I spent on the campaigns are here to real challenge for close to or close to actually having\nNo money left but we have raised over two million dollars to ... to ... million dollars out the bench the Bloomberg type money that's coming into the into the race\nThat the press is calling this a forty eighth district race in California a referendum on Trump and the Trump agenda what is your take on a\n[noise] I think that ...\nThat's one element of the race certainly a a I think though that I've been to a supporter of the president on things like illegal immigration I differ with the president once or twice as well on a on a major issues but most things like that on the plus side\nAnd I admire the president and the good job but he's been doing so that is an issue here\nHowever the the most important thing is is that my opponent these you've got a choice between myself and another person and how the Democratic candidates are we ... and she or he basically\nDoes he's a newcomer to the area and he doesn't understand any of the things that go to the heart of what it's like to be a ... does this county in this part of the country\nAnd I mean I grew up sort of people on the beaches here and uh I've been uh I I went to high school here\nAnd a college here have come to your um so what it is is that if the president is an issue but we've got an outsider in this district was trying to a game right to represent us a guy on the air\nIs leaving for our community really\nYeah well there you know obviously in the ... year the is a is quite a trophy if the Democrats can defeat you\nAre you been in Fifteen terms I you came in as a strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning and are you now are in the fight with you know someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside money\nWho's challenging the entire world view of a chomping conservatism as Orange County itself has seen an influx of a folks from Los Angeles\nAnd more liberal enclaves of the state of California uh so what do you say to my listeners um congressman or our backer about what California has done wrong that could end up transplanting itself across the United states extending across the United states\nWell all part of our our big problem that in California and of course uh it's it's now having a major impact or is it say on our quality of life you have to look at that things and and how pervasive this whole issue\nOf vision of having millions of of non citizens\nAre coming here illegally into cars in our society are right in our education system is going is going as if it's been a disaster for education system but\nWe have issues that people talk about like uh how about the homeless and when you take a look close look at what that means is there are a lot of people out our state for example who are down in their life has to homeless people you ask\nHave drug and alcohol problems but they're probably half of the people were home those who are people who had gone to ... they lost their job\nOr something and they can't find a housing that that they can afford that that they that they have the money to be able to pay the rent that's because for the last Fifteen Twenty years\nWhat's happened is all the political housing the low low priced housing that would be available website great house but it's clean and nice living it has been\nThe low low priced housing\nThat would be available like Craig Nelson ... has been to get a ... year hughley there'll be two or three families so here we have so much of our of our problems bill directly from the fact that the federal government\nIs in the ... border and as I say here I think what people think about it or I think historically\nSuccessful I Hope you will be this person with a critical services and turn around the country but\nI Want to play something very quickly for this is from your a primary I think this is from the primary debate with your current your your opponent hardly root of all let's listen\nTo what do you support spanning expanding Medicaid for undocumented adults as well Mr ... yes and when I talk about Medicare for all or some of these other measures that provide some level of assistance to some groups are the answer would be for all residents of the

right now about seven thousand dollars were willing to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on their mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes\nYeah by a couple of good uh\nWars that to be something um who could build up that the future mission and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free accept your home correct\nIn addition to the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund of three to six months of expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that about good\nOkay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but piles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your\nSavings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can\nShow what I Would do with this money is I Would ever market for school and mission trip\n'cause you guys are out here and obviously LDS right we are you\nOK cool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund\nAnd I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good grow stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund in your name\nCom\n\nJoining\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri river they not due to what's up [noise] um my husband\nI mean just finished SP you ah were on baby step to and for the last five years we have been building our home\nPaycheck to paycheck and um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it a kind of get things rolling a little bit\nBut um we got an offer to do with irritating position and the guy's a the a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live um do we sell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue making payment on it\nIt's not completed\nWell it [noise] we're at a point it means a paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in a\nNo no um well we were living in a mobile home um but then we got this offered to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nOur doctor okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other health known okay we will talk to show them the conditions yeah what do I can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping a\nWhat will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar you know and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [noise]\n[noise]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year and go through your husband's only one working well we have a business um those are more than I N running during my money\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand yearly\nOkay\nAnd then doing the care taking because in order to be made in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYou're going up or into your ... until he decides he doesn't want you to take any more and then you don't have a ... for free anymore and that's all right so I mean you walk into more on fire you pretty much a change my mind and then you have a housing issue again right right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring ...\nOh well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand it's more completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and forty five\nNo no no it's not completed it won't know um because you you it's further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer ... bothers house\nKinda because they don't have the money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on those trials and so that limits\nYour in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount build them a lot deeper than that if you go to a hundred dollars should be flying I'm going to show 'em how much will be borrowed against it so far\nOr the house itself we owe thirty thousand but there are some property attached to it so altogether is a hundred thousand\nOwe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty\nAbout\nYou oh a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes okay alright\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then to\nContinue paying money and how we yeah\nWe all have you know I should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're gonna get a little money out of it so you know it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here\nRight you'll get a little bit but it's not is is not worked out very good so\nYou know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income because your household income as you I'm very very low income\nAnd ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching glowing painting and\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get his sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\n... so an acre off the corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved\nOlivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up\nAnd I had a question and I had just came out of debt and I'm I'm wanting to pay that off the air that right [noise]\nUm but on a farm in recovery for and it actually and and part of that is going to therapy so [noise] um [noise] I regularly and kind of ... ... budget and and I pet therapy at the end it's likely not going to get aid and how kind of\nAn adequate that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget or how big of a priority to make it how long have you been clean and tribal\nGood for you well then what is it\n[noise] and ...\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to therapy on hold right now there's just something you need you need some accounts or to walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement [laughter] now\nWhat I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise therapist is not perfect [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that\nAnd the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income and you're out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing you're going to feel more energized to make more income and so\nIf this month you don't pay any extra on the debt that you pay your therapy good if next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to but\nFor today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start by but it's not like you told me you've been you know clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you\n[laughter] so let's get you killed and then let's see all your money\nAnd as you ... and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK\nI'm OK Now getting the money no it's not like all or nothing is going to be gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and you know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you've turned the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then\nAs you make incremental progress\nMove more and more of the money from your new in Germany or increased income\nMove more and more than money from your new income and your increased income to\nThe debt size for today we want to take care of a movie [noise] you need to be taken care of and you're doing a good job to your show out of this or whatever I'm sure\n[noise]\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have\nUm and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a recovered opening thing up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was ... it was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part\nWhere we're ah we're working on I Will vote and so because we had the best one is a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we uh um\nUh we've been discussing this actual needs trust on oil that has to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal ... sure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the ah and we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course\nUh you know his his creatures ever worried score too early to know what is fully what it needs are we've been blessed that he's [laughter] he's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh\n[noise] uh you know that was far too early to know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as we're as I'm getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the ... the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded proud of your death\nOkay so that is Rhonda it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth okay and it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to have you\nAs alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care\nFor this child\nWho out of those assets now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die\nIt gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs and um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion\nOf the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust in the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life not just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that\nAnd then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that's the dream yeah it's a dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going\nThat's the legacy baby [laughter] was out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in mind\nThat's the legacy by big [laughter] was out\nOf that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is going to be part in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife were to pass\nThe rest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly her but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's a thousand dollars a year it'll produce ... that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy them you know would you would you build it had like we're doing right now would you form the trust of the legal entity known now and we've been unfunded or would not let it they would make it a clause in in the ... when I when I was\nMaking a clause in the world will be formed upon both of your ... okay\nBecause you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing\nYou don't need a skirmish that all the time you don't need to go to all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example a guy ... is a is a special conditional version of just taking care of minor children ride cooked and the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own so my need for a trust to cover\nMy minor children in a in a live in both of our best expires at I formed a trust for my minor children at that time of the need for that expired and I would have done it for nothing in this case was not only for another you're going to need a ...\nBut I wouldn't be doing it until you die mess with having family bombed out in the ... that's what I Would say that that's how we do things for the call\n[noise]\n\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and\nDisability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and\nYour family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families\nStay away from cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off disability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of

anything and you know what I mean control over what happens with the pension plans you don't choose the investments you don't get to\nUm you know if the ... municipality in your case as poorly run they could break the pension plan happened before doesn't happen very much but um no I think you need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\n... four one K. is whatever you got to do

Pittsburgh Hi John welcome to the day Ramsey show how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm good I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question uh my wife is the ... to\nWhere you're now into getting on the on the ... on Mars and saved up mhm and now we're looking for a new place to live the house was rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I got about ... about ... ... up and down the stairs opinion about all the time because\nUm my question is\nUm the rentals around this area now are skyrocketing in because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in most states sucking all those from her but I found a couple of houses like who purchase and the immigrant right now eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop\nSearches and the and my ... right now is eight Seventy five a month [noise] ah my payment would drop to about six hundred and thirty dollars from up mhm\nI'm mean other part of it is a when I retired from the post office I rolled my ah through savings plan into an IRA and good but I can borrow enough for him right now with no penalty should be able to put towards ... percent down ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ...\n... you know just like you and your family and I don't you don't want ... percent no\nYou're you're you're turning your two broke to buy a house here in ... okay you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you are moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and house substantially moved down to a different rental and let me just tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order\nI if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine ah for a short period of time\nThat while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that and a few years if you're careful watch what you're doing\nAnd then make your purchase but ah when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid\nOwning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse rather than a blessing Steven is in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nEither want to know what would be a martyr to do the right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes circle hypothetically at me and my wife only had\nThat none of mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred it go toward them investigating whether it be smarter to put all of it into my ... hire a as is or should I open up a lot for my and my wife's name and I flipped the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch or go that way\nWhat's your household income\nOr a household income and fifty thousand\nOkay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement is more like a ten thousand now it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um\n[noise] okay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some\n... it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put\nThree thousand in more than three thousand and another okay one and not one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or are um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it doesn't matter\nUh he'll I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up wind have five hundred and ... and five and her you know the exact\nExactly it doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise]\nThe only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else\nShe's going to get half that money even if it is and your name OK okay that's how it is not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement that's baby step forward\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund and ...\nWhich may be why you don't have the money right now that's why we put baby step for after getting out of bed and after having emergency but we don't folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent of way\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing and James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up uh my wife and I are planning\nSo are you good thank you for taking my call sure what's up uh my wife and I are planning to our home next year and we're having a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on the type of house with them or to get\n... ah Arlington towards getting a fixer upper there'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn learn how to deal with our parents myself ... and she wants to get moving around the house\nMhm occur and to be your first home\nThey are second all we had a house for a while ago and then we moved can whip and rent renting her little over a year now\nThe other home that you had was it a fixer upper\nIt was not able to move in ready\n... ... and um so what is her fear\nIt's just more or we have two kids you know and it kind of old hassle Amanda how mhm I didn't want anything major just just a minor cosmetic type of\nMore couldn't you do it for you moved in\nAll financially I'll think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay sure what you're saying that your your your fixer upper would take a few months may be and you wouldn't have ...\nI'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it I can sell it tax free\n... show and there are any work that out of my adult because so much for anyone to be a real estate agent so how's Texas where you first residents will be limited to your factory growth on that anyone for anybody [noise] um\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time I get home linked to some valid point on hers we're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument to half\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out\nUh probably know we would go to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably because I can take I can take you there is no survivor and probably get more yeah\nBut are you healthy yes I Would take it as no survivor get more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife have something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get out\nOkay are currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit\nBecause that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay\nThat that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in good shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\n\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old and you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it\nAnd so I Would you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nThink I remember there was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much money\nRight\nAnd you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are you know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThe problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual funds this becomes like a no brainer instead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the sale\nBoudreau funds this becomes like a no brainer instead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the failed around properties and\nYou know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank\nAnd bank all of it and health insurance as part of

in the end your students most people look at me about halfway through the the L I Can't do that\nWhy why why do you think\nAnd what's interesting is most people look at me about halfway through and I can't do that\nWhy why why do you think they say that\nWell we did it they have to lead to discipline I mean every day you make a financial decision you know do I say the money or die spending you know I'm\nSo ... it's not a true statement I Can't do that the statement as I won't do that\nYes that I I agree with that and they\nThey do and what did you do for KFC\nWell I started as a dishwasher

know so it's it's not and it's not an education thing it the hard work very\nWell and and as you said the discipline to everyday make a good financial decision so what would you tell the on Nineteen

demeanor is on social media on social media is is broke into the country or around the world I mean it certainly is corrosive bit is turned crazily divisive obviously\nIt has turned into the the incubator the the the petri dish of every conspiracy lunatic on the planet I mean look at the shooter for instance in Pittsburgh\nAnd the hit my grade on to a a social media platform is gab which allowed essentially unfettered uncensored a nasty activity which is not tolerated by some of the more mainstream sites although they can't police at all\nObviously so I've got this wired piece here and I've got a bunch of notes on the story and essentially it says you know social media has been absolutely ... commandeer to buy box\nAnd among talking on Facebook I'm Talking about Twitter year\nI'm again I'm not even talking about the extreme of sites that we've learned about the the gab site which is popular with white supremacist Samantha semi ... and a radical groups for instance it you know ... races\nTwitter Twitter is becoming a major major culprit here especially in the handling of major news\nEvents [noise] oh I'll give you an example on the caravan last week that the caravan the mud doing caravan which is headed toward the United states dominated the national news on TV on radio and friends social media [noise]\nBut do you actually know how much of an impact for instance Twitter may with the propagation of that story hold on let\nOh\n[noise] this is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners are less ... skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defected to call it an air bags and their vehicles\nAnd you have so many people they clean and are so into social media whether it is Facebook or Twitter\nAnother avenue and you have so many people they've cleaned and are so into social media whether it is Facebook or Twitter or other social media sites that it's another tool that can be used to drive us apart and I'm telling you\nThey're trying to rip us apart from within and when I say they I'm I'm Talking about foreign governments like Russia and China there's no doubt about it you know even a few largely agree with the wave of the president is handling\nThe migrant caravans situation though the fifty two hundred troops there's no sense of the border for support for instance\nI\nUsed to be very concerned about the use of these bonds which had been exposed a previously but I just don't know if people had an idea on the extent and of course the election interference\nAnd this is all part of that that program of the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese\nChinese or involving the really the ferry is bad activity\nThe Russians have gotten a lot of attention was the election interference but trust me the Chinese are interfering as much as the Russians and maybe even more and then I'll be laughing behind the scenes of the Russians are getting more of the attention here\nBut you should be very concerned with social media ... in this case sixty percent of the conversation regarding the migrant caravans on Twitter driven by bots manipulating facts manipulating the stories taking sides\nAre turning up the heat on opinion and victory all an venom and just some of the the more a toxic type post for instance\nNo even over the weekend when the caravan took a backseat to what happened in Pittsburgh\nThe coverage you know the the Pittsburgh tragedy with the and the anti Semitic attacks at the ... synagogue bots was still responsible according to this piece for forty\nPercent of the caravan conversation on Twitter almost half\nAnd how this can steer the conversation in this country is truly amazing now a little more detail here this is all according to the stats here the facts are according to an assessment by a company called Rob a hat labs\nNow this is a start up that was founded by a couple a UC Berkeley students and it builds these\nTools to detect these spots on line so they developed this tool it's a an extension cold box checked me\nAnd it allows users to see which Twitter accounts are most likely boss and not real people and it's the bulk\nThat's driving so if you get a\n... a tweet or somebody responds to is it real or is it a thought that this program is supposed to be able to tell you whether it's real or now they're going to launch a new tool let's just see how much Don activity there is across an entire topic or a hash tag for instance\nOr the new tools that does that is called fat check Mazie got bought checked me you've got to fact check me\nAnd I found that in terms of discussion about mass uh uh the mass shooting situation at the synagogue and squirrels hill in Pittsburgh and found that the discussion\nRegarding that twenty three percent of that originated from bots on Twitter\nAnd remember Twitter had made this big portion big announcement that they were cracking down on all this bought activity well does it look like they really got their hands on this and I had a whole bunch of accounts that were the lead it I think ... the lead in millions of accounts\nOn Twitter which were identified as as spam or bonds I Know that I dropped\nI dropped about I think four thousand I had the exact math and I tweeted it out but I I lost about four thousand followers which I guess Twitter deemed to be bought activity of those those just disappeared\nSo am trying to replace him with real people so if you're a real person the police following me on Twitter at Todd Schmidt I Am ... I Am not a pot\n\nSo with Twitter they banned users from posting these identical tweets to these multiple accounts a and once or then re tweeting and liking or you know and mass\nDan fickle tweets to these multiple accounts a and once or then re tweeting and liking or you know and mass\nFrom different accounts and it's all you know a computer program an algorithm that does this and they're trying to figure it out but clearly if you got sixty percent of the caravan discussion being originated by bots they've got a long way to go here\nYou know the box having disappeared the boss of just more and it doesn't seem like Twitter is able to keep up with this\nSo instead of you know just to find a you know the ... or ... instead of you know Twitter I talk about the what we purge deal I think they continue to do so\nUh it's now they're kind of quiet and I I don't think they want to talk about all of the box that they have been purged which I think is a is a huge issue\nSo instead of sending automated tweets the Twitter might believe now you have\nBonds which just spraying and they amplify this politically and divisive content you know written by actual human being so it's it's finding some of the nastiest comments or most divisive comments\nAnd the ... season those and then re tweeting so they're finding ways to evolve to stay a couple of steps ahead of Twitter\nSo do you know if you're being sucked in that's the big part of why I'm Talking about this if if your triggered or if if you're in a sense when you climb around social media\nAre you being played the fact is we are being played by foreign governments on a pretty big dams scale here\nAnd\nIt got to be aware of that that's that's the danger you\nKnow the box or getting smart they're identifying these waves and key issues\nAnd their Guam and on their grabbing them and they're feeding the different sites and they're causing again this this toxicity that is occurring in this country\nWhere we're being you know shrimp and we're being torn apart so we already have some deep divisions and now you've got countries like Russia or China or those that are operating these spots they are from the social media standpoint they're\nThey're deepening the problem there deepening divisions\nYou know by providing each side with with the ... mission to attack with were being manipulated were being used were being were being calm on a very large level\nAnd again I Know a lot of this is true because as soon my executive producer will get phone calls from people that are repeating a lot of this activity they're seeing on social media and Twitter which is being driven by foreign government bots\n\nEight hundred I'm sort of phones here at the moment I got my Halloween pile I Want to lighten things up with some

just moved back in the u._k. and we lived in a house that was built in Seventeen fifty and we had the records of everybody\nYou'd ever lived in the house and other than us in the owner before as every one of them had died in the house and while\nWe\nYeah we used to have things that would disappear move around like come on and off but never seem to bother of\nSlowly you truly think the house was haunted from previous residents that died in the house\nYet yeah\nWere you able to ascertain how many actual people died in the house\nWe had record for about fifty different people a previous donors in Seventeen at the end of the one before it all died in the house\nSo they died of natural causes you know they weren't hospitalized do they they all died in the house essentially of of old age or natural causes\nYeah yes and and at some point back in the well quite positive in the house he knew they had called car the symbol then to the ... you know how to ward off people's fear\nAnd it's like something out of the conjuring or something somebody get Patrick Wilson on the phone or on John Wilson remark I guess they'll do as well uh so uh ... where was I was little kid\nIt was the topic in England\nSo so um yeah yes Seventeen fifty\nYeah I think that's an ... fifty people you think died in the hall that is crazy John thanks for the call I appreciate it\nOr I have a great when I was in Englewood, Florida out you're on Smith\nThat wouldn't bother me because we did that in ... Illinois back in the fifties and I I'm eighty two but that didn't bother me at all I knew the person that died and we rent a house and no problem but I got something else to tell you happen they sure\nAre minister died over three years ago and so we got a new minister and\nYou know all of the phones have been changed and everything so I dialed the day to call ... minister of our guys are\nAnd you know all of the phones have been changed and everything so I dialed the day to call the new minister of our days are calling about something and something happened with the phone lines and our debt minister answered\nBecause somehow the lines of ... I don't know what happened but he went through his whole spiel about the church and the times and now it's changing the back [laughter]\n... [laughter] so I'm wary if\nYou call the church and you've got a recorded message of the old minister\nMinister that's right but it's been changing now for over two years we've added new minister for over two years to ... days when I download that something happened and the old ministers recording wow is all [laughter]\nAnd this is this is an angle would Florida that's right it's called the eastern ... church of Christ and and he answered the phone did you ask why did you call did you call the office to say hey what's going on\nOr yeah and finally now I call just a few minutes ago and it's back to the new minister so whatever they did or whatever\nI had I I I'm guessing I'm guessing it's nothing really uh\nSeriously a spooky I'm guessing that the old minister was ... whatever they're using as an answering machine or whatever the the digital system is his recording is still in there the new recording was created and somehow the files got swamped\nWhy on Halloween [laughter]\nWell it certainly adds a little bit of mystery and in free now doesn't it", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "31"}
