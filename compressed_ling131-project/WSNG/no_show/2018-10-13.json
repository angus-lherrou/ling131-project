ourselves in tire industry is that I don't think that would be moral either why should a fellow who was in ... in in western Pennsylvania and the cold business why should he now not have an income for his family because some internal Saudi thing or some internal Chinese thing why should they lose his job over there\nAnd rabbi might be a bit hypocritical don't you imagine that our government truth be told occasionally kills people are in various places for reasons that they may not be able to even tell the American public about\nYeah well I'm not going to admit to that [laughter] but but\nEven the lead the best of countries are sometimes um when it comes to certain individual people that they feel it may have been a spy or a mole 'em or you know a lot of these things these deep deep CIA type of things that we have no way of knowing ever really\nUm so we know these things happen but like I said there's a big difference a look before we punish entire industries which we always have to translate that into people there are people all throughout West Virginia and and southern Pennsylvania and north east Pennsylvania that depend on\nA thriving coal business really depends on China or what are we going to do put everybody out of business and then everybody in the\nBowling they can sell anything so what's that going to do to a parts of the they have employees in Seattle they have in Chicago it got down in the Carolinas\nThe farmers are working at all the farmers in Iowa in Kansas though I I think that I was hoping you were going to ask that question 'cause we've got to make the distinction between a country that's involved in the hotel genocide versus all this\nStuff that has to do with spies and I'll tell you one more thing I Do feel this or if this would not be a reporter and he happened to work for the Washington Post\nI don't know that there'd be such an outcry all over the world about this in the western media it's one of their own yup as opposed to let's say some businessmen was knocked off for some reason\nWe did hear about it but I don't think it would rise to this level this is this is a journalist so you expect the brush to make a\nA a very strong case at monumental cases if we're supposed to know several relations\nI'm Talking to rabbi a real sparrow who's known as world was America's rabbi he's also the author of push back\nReclaiming our American Judeo Christian eat those the other thing you mentioned just in passing or Judy you brush to across was the issue of pushing them into somebody else's orbit and that is if you say well we'll cut off the Saudis I'm sure that the Russian\nYou you brush to across was the issue of pushing them into somebody else's orbit and that is if you say well we'll cut off the Saudis I'm sure that the Russians and the Chinese would love to have an opportunity to bring Saudi Arabia into their orbit and you know what I mean rather than having them be uh you know a ... a country that at least\nA you know that they have helped us out in both of\nThe Gulf wars and in other situations and currently they appear to be a you know they appear to be doing pretty well in in in broadening relations let's say with Israel which is is not a bad thing in the middle east we need our allies in that region don't weigh\n... ... that's a very important point you make the size the economic aspect of it and they use the word orbit if we're not going to be selling these things to Saudi Arabia and China and Russia will I Will not just lose the economic part of it\nBut that's the word orbit politically they will no longer consider us and allied they might allied themselves with Russia with China\nAnd what that would do to the foreign\nPolicy the necessities of America\nThat would just deck of crushed the world that is something that I just don't think that however drastic this is certainly terrible for the family and I'm sure that journalists were afraid but I really wouldn't turn the world upside down over an out and who knows what it could lead to what type of brink\nOf war this good didn't realignment of powers\nI wouldn't do that over this one incident no\nNo and and your you know it's funny right by because I'm a big supporter of Israel is imagine you are as well and Iran is one of the primary forces against Israel funding\nAll kinds of terrorist activities uh you know through Syria and other places against Israel I'm sure the Iranians would love it too if the United states did not have this major ally of the Saudis because that means the United states' ability to push back against Iran or is also going to be impeded if we don't have those allies and I'm I I look rabbi I\nAlso have questions about some of the Saudis role in some things that haven't been as good for the United states as well I don't see them as entirely on our side but on the other hand I'd rather have them well like Reagan used to say my ah my eighty percent a friend is not my twenty percent\nEnemy or you you can't run things that way and if you decide on absolutes you kill a journalist we cut you off\nAltogether you're going to end up with no friends at all\n[noise] you know that's an important point I bet you you're going to hear the coming days people on the left\n... number one wants to see Trump's foreign policy just disintegrate they want to see failure and certainly they would like Israel to lose a an important ally that they have now in Saudi Arabia but primarily they would like to see a collapse\nThe first sentence that had nothing to do with the seventh and\nIt was all over the place and and mentally unstable but I don't believe he's that way\nEven though he admitted to buy polish ship and even though\nThey last like Don Lemon ... were saying he has a little probably needs to take care of him so I think he did it because people like you and your your right we'll talk a head with a good thing is is like what is he is defending is is is fake Lucy's\nRally because there's no neighbors and though he was not totally bonkers\nSee I don't think he was I Know isn't too well okay you've asserted that let me make the argument to the counter All right\nThat okay with you yeah sure I'm OK I Want to\nMake it in and check before you do I like it address where the thing in the ... as the other side of the the best route should live there than it should be a complete their ...\nAnd he is I Know about in hold on hold on to you know Don take a breath and I'm going to respond I'll put you on hold if I have to here's my answer directly to that point which you interrupted there are a lot of people I Know who communicate has kind of a stream of consciousness and one of them who I've met\nAnd I admire greatly is Donald Trump if you listen to his speeches\nHe will often start on one tack he'll go to something else that may seem unrelated then they'll go to something else that I go to something else it can be difficult to follow up but I think that's a style and and it's something that people do and I don't honestly think\nThey have a lot of control over it I can do the same thing sometimes I find myself down the rabbit hole because all start on tax policy I'll go to drug policy I'll go to\nOf control over it I can do the same thing sometimes I find myself down the rabbit hole because all start on tax policy I'll go to drug policy I'll go to talking about the wall and then and and if you're planning it well then you may end up all the way wrapped around to something else like defense policy it happens\nThere are other times where I think at a very linear manner\nAnd I go from eight to beat to see and if I keep going all ended up and see that's what you're saying is that somebody is crazy if\nThey don't communicate in an entirely linear way in all instances I Will tell you something having sat in that same office not with President Trump although I Hope to one of these days but if you've never been in the oval office you don't know how totally intimidating it can be and I would imagine\nEven for a guy who's used to performing like Kanye West does that would be an intimidating experience\nYou're in the oval office with the president you're surrounded by what looks like about six dozen urged cameras and everything else and then you say gosh he didn't seem to be speaking from a set of notes or on a strict outline and he started at eight and ... L and then went back to see and went off dizzy and came back\nTo ... and ... you know that that is the fact that he wasn't going in a straight line shows he's crazy then unfortunately an awful lot of us are probably crazy as well there are people and I know them some people I Know who are very smart who don't always talk in a linear fashion\nOne of them is one of my best friends over forty years he's a prosecutor he's very smart but he will sometimes start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so given that\nAnd don't decide these crazy if you sit down and do what I Do encourage people to do and I've said this a few times today listen to what he said\nTo where he talked about the\nLack of father figures in families and that's something that's not a black or white issue it is an issue for all families\nIf you don't have a father figure in that family and they're very many households this is not disparaging single mothers raising kids it's a tough job to do but without a male figure there those kids miss out on something important and oftentimes ended up going off the path\nHe went from bad to welfare and its influence I think an awful lot of what he said was actually very very conservative and that's why the media's going nuts on it let's go to Douglas and Douglas welcome to First Amendment product what's

friend Dr\nHenry Miller who's a senior fellow at the Pacific resurgence he's published in the popular press\nAnd in scholarly journals as well a dock it's good to have you back welcome to the program equate\nTo be with you a large thank you\nBefore we get into this discussion about dark regulatory matter would you mind telling my audience what dark regulatory matter deans [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know dark matter\nIs often referred to as a the set of tools that this so called deep state court dark state choose to carry out their own agenda is sometimes independent of the intention of Congress or of the administration that they're supposed to be working for and I'm\nIn the context of a regulatory agencies there are several kinds of of dark matter of ways that they can get around the specified procedures for carrying out their work so\nI'm the one example is um regulatory discretion and and that means that\nUm they have discretion within what the law dictates that regulated industry or individuals much too and at the the most egregious example of that with which your listeners will be familiar\nWas a then FBI Director Comey's decision an announcement that I'm Hillary Clinton's transgressions with respect to a handling\nThe email a private in her private email server and so on did not meet the criteria for prosecution in his opinion so that was discretion about whether there should be enforcement of the rules about the classify handling classified information\nUm but they're they're all sorts of examples of ... in the in the regulatory community so I'm a ... for example a marijuana possession is still a federal crime\nAnd yet not prosecuted at all in a amounts per individual used in states like Colorado and California so there's a good example of federal enforcement discretion better runs well\n... ... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it is it called the Dolan agreement there was actually drawn up by Obama that effectively\nSaid All right the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by the stage even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to\nMake it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use but at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and said that's what the agreement says it also says the agreement is null and void of the state allows a large amounts of contraband\nHot to be shipped out of state into other states that have not agreed to legalize it\nSo at least those states get some protection but just some of this the regulatory dark matter also happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion uh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to give it\n... well yeah and that's and that's the problem a\nShow that I'm a\n... FDA for example or does this all the time and it had a good example\nIs another kind of regulatory dark matter\nIf it is a back up a little bit and not just a second kind of regulatory dark matter\nIs the issuance of guidance documents or memoranda ... instead of formal rulemaking formal role mimicking specifies that there has to be an announcement on the federal register public comment consideration of public comment\nAnd then finally say Asian or the ... of the rule but the agencies\nThe register public comment consideration of public comment and then find out was Asian or the ... of the rule\nBut the agencies often get around that by issuing guidance documents and then uh\nWithin the uh the guidance that they specify which is often new policy making new law making that really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify ... carve outs or enforcement discretion within that and that's\nA sometimes at a bridge too far too much for autonomy that was never contemplated for a for regulatory agencies and yet they do this they do this all the time some guidance is good\nSo that for example if the ... as the food truck and cause medical or a law that says a there has to be a pre approval inspections of drug manufacturing the circle manufacturing facilities\nBut uh but guidance documents can tell the industry what the nature of those are in a ... minute inspections will be\nTwo they have to be announced can they be unannounced or are they supposed to avoid disrupting the pharmaceutical production uh how long should they last ah quite should be the outcome on in terms of paperwork and so on so that's good\nBut uh but sometimes guidance makes brand new policy which is far beyond what anyone to contemplate that\nAnd it wasn't that brief go ahead though and that and that brings up the as a sort of a conflict if you get regular tore agencies too much of a ton of money or you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you give them too little you have them\nAre unable to adjust to situations new technology is new situations that might arise\nSo what's the best way of renting it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would be\nWell the best way to rent it in it as we've discussed in other context is for Congress to exercise and performance oversight responsibilities I'm much better much more strictly much more conscientiously than they do [noise]\nDock I'll tell you this this stuff drives me nuts because I guess I expect that people who work in the federal government and poll of federal paycheck out of the public treasury would be people of good faith and to some extent I imagine\nThere are plenty of people who meet that description and then there are other people who seem to think my federal job is not just a great paycheck integrate pension but his mind a license to go out and fix things to be the way I\nThink they ought to be instead of the way that I'd been directed and I know that some of these people didn't like the choice of Donald Trump I frankly don't care I didn't like the choice of rock Obama but I also didn't suggest that well if you didn't like Brock Obama then you should work from\nWithin whatever agency work and to try and sabotage his policies which I don't think I've done very much a but people are certainly saying I'm going to sabotage the policies of\nAh of Donald Trump and make sure that his policies don't happen and when they do that\nAs far as I'm concerned they're spitting in the face of the voters who approved Donald Trump whether you like him or not he was the choice of the system that we have Dr Miller thank you very much you're listening I got a break but I I really\nAppreciate the time you can read about this a doctor or Miller has written about this extensively at I B.D investors business daily and we always appreciate our visits with Dr doc thanks very much and he's at the Pacific research Institute is well hey I Want to remind you something about sleep\nWe're heading into fall it is getting colder there's more rain there's more adverse whether you need your sleep so how does a great night sleep improve your performance\nHow 'bout more energy less brain\nFog better mood and more productivity the news ... number three sixty smart bet that's the kind that teen and I sleep on helps everybody from parents to pro athletes to improve their daily performance through proven quality sleep my sleep number setting is a sixty five and teen is is it\nThirty five or forty or forty five but that's the beauty\nShe can change her side I can change my side and so many couples disagree on mattress\n[noise] well you know I actually wrote a big essay about that issue of temptation I was published is a couple of years ago in a in a left wing publication I published everywhere by the way ...

gets more powerful and then all of our friends in the Democratic party why the idea is never occurred to them let me give you a couple of numbers to evaluate that I'm going to give you first the\nNet worth of three individuals\nBefore they became president and then I'll give you the network of those individuals after\nThey left the president Donald Trump came into the presidency with a net worth of four point\nFive billion dollars rock Obama came in worth about three million largely a house in Chicago in a few other things and the Clintons came into the presidency Bill Clinton's presidency with less than half\nA million bucks in net worth I mean in fact\nIs the Clinton family had spent most of its life in public housing before that\nYou know living in the governor's mansion in Arkansas and that sort of thing now compare that with today from comes in worth four point five billion today is estimated network is three billion dollars thirty percent lower one and a half\nBillion dollars less now he's still president we don't know what's going to happen after his second term because I think he's going to get a second term block Obama came in\nSo now he's still president we don't know what's gonna happen after his second term because I think he's going to get a second term Brock Obama came in with\nThree million dollars network what's his net worth today forty billion dollars Thirteen times as much money as he came in with the Clintons came in as I said worth less than half\nA million dollars they're estimated net worth today is a hundred million dollars to a hundred times what they came in with just consider\nIs Donald Trump the guy who's trying to steal your money or make things more unequal he's actually lost money by being president of the United states and not a small some one and a\nHalf billion dollars so far and you say well he'll probably make it up later you're all these stories about well he's he's got Saudi ambassadors who are renting rooms and the

got a chance to go down to Mississippi and try to help them and become a United States senator and it didn't happen that time and I think honestly the man was cheated out of an opportunity\nA by a senator who labeled himself a Republican but actually acted more like a Democrat\nWell Senator Chris McDaniel is back at it he is now a Mississippi State senator who is running for the United states and and he joins Mennonite a Senator Mitch Daniels state senator Mitch Daniels it's good to have you back on the program and or I Want to see this wouldn't come out differently if you don't mind\nYeah absolutely and thank you for having me you know a four years ago we we had that race and you remember what happened to wage we thought the good fight of the night of the primary we want fifty nine percent of the Republican vote but because of genetic and\nThey pushed forty thousand Democrat the typical public at ... the Democrat selected our\nNominee and then as you don't have the establishment of work they can't they just right or center to talk with to step down did they hand selected another Democrat for the seat so here we are back in a very similar city fight here at the city so it's really great to be or\nWould you mind explained to my audience how it is this complicated the Mississippi ends up with this system in which Republicans can have their choices taken away from them by Democrats crossing ...\nIt was remarkable we help is very conservative state and all the joke of the campaign trail if you can't find a conservative to ship the United states that have to look at the ... you got to find what it's like living from Massachusetts California it's good to say so but what happens here\nWe have a large lobbying presents because of Haley Barbour and others at the party is they want to keep that gravy train ... what they do is they are it's a nice a so called Republicans who are really\nBig government Republicans they believe in big ... big taxi then another liberal country else but they hide behind that are meant to Mississippi over the years we always manage to health conscious individuals get still with me dead last economically speaking so\nWhat was just in this another direction we think that the state can do better we know it can't just do away with it\nDead last economically speaking so what was it just in this another direction we think that this state can do better we know it can't just do away with the good old boy club blew away the ... the lobbyists and the cronies and reimpose liberty for everybody and that's what we're trying to do\nSo how's the race going at this point one of the polls show\nVery well the polls are all over the place I mean I\nYou know what do you do a poll of um of Donald Trump we told they told us he had an ... percent chance of losing and they won so uh some polls have us up or there's a pack poll shows us up eight to ten there's ah NBC pulled a shows us down five other polls are being whispered about to shore up two or three\nWho knows what I Do know that we have all the momentum and the reason I Know that is we can feel the buzz on the ground and guess what will run against someone who was a life time Democrats you served three terms in the states it as a Democrat she voted for Hillary Clinton\nHalf this all Democrats that grounded fact before she came back to the ship you ran for state Senate she was a federal law to be said she lobbied to help to organization that pushed for Obamacare and pushed for\nUniversal healthcare so when people find that out about the appointed senator guess what they rush away in droves and they run toward our campaign that's the only conservative and the great so as long as you're spread that message and people were hearing it where when it\nSo tell me that is a columnist recently said that your star is fading so tell me how you close the gap between now and election day\nWe got to drive a we have to drive interested obviously there's a fundamental component there are there's also just a a a person a individual component there were people have to challenge talks their neighbors make phone calls and inspired Mississippians get out to vote and I would disagree that the story stating\nThe establishment spent ... million dollars a negative thing I Can't speak it twenty four team\nThey ... billion dollars at this time it gets so Fifteen million dollars in negative money in a small state like city all to drive me away\nAnd what's the big problem I'm a conservative I'm trying to hold them accountable and they don't want to be held accountable I don't think my stores going anywhere as long as the people on a champion that wants to fight or I'm going to be that guy\nHow many of those do you think that the Kavanaugh hearings are going to have any kind of effect because I I understand that there were senators who they are a lot of the focus on Murkowski and flake and Collins and ...\nAnd and yeah I also wondered about the effect that it was going to have when people and especially conservatives like Mississippi looked at those even if you're a Democrat\nAnd a bit conservative and you said gosh I don't want my son or daughter held to this kind of standard where a single false\nAccusation with such thin evidence even if it was basically her story and her story largely incomplete I Wonder whether that's going to have any kind of effect on the electric Mississippi\n... I Hope that it does I Hope the people of our state come to the conclusion that the Democrats have gone completely I'm completely to the wealthy are the words they works to so far left where they're more socialist now than they are Democrat more radical\nWho they are moderate and frankly it's a dangerous party and if we don't find Republicans that can stand in the Gallup and not just Republicans conservatives that standard the gal to push back\nAgainst that party we're going to lose this country so we always argue the days of reaching across the aisle\nOr over the days of chase him in the class to the ... or over we have to stand in the gap now in force discovered in the back to the plight back toward liberty back where it belongs to lose this country so I Hope people recognize how dangerous that party has become and how much we have to fight to preserve our way of life\nI'm Talking to a state senator Chris McDaniel who's running for the United States Senate from Mississippi so how can people help you out financially because I Know and he's closing weeks of the campaign a lot of money gets spent and often times like it or not money makes the difference because of advertising and get out\nThe vote is er it's a big deal to she's a spin on us right now probably Fifteen to one\nShe's got all the flop money I'll call bunny in the U.S chamber of commerce suspended buddies out here trying to save her we just need you to help us you guys out there listening met Daniel\nTwenty eight team dot com go to Daniel twenty Eighteen dot com you'll see my plants or what I Believe in and if you get a chance please come help us Mississippi would love to have the conservative us editor and I promised that will fight for everybody\nOr Chris one last thing and that is let's assume you become the next US Senator from the state of Mississippi I'd be pleased by that because I'd love to see you get there I ... you got the right values and and I I fully endorse your candidacy but but tell me the circuit in what are you going to be your top priorities is a brand new limited US Senator\nI think number one we ... we have to build that border wall that has to be funded number two term limits\nThis is a brand new limited US Senator\nOr the number one we ... we have to build that border wall that has to be funded number two term limits it's just time\nTo shock the system to bring some of these politicians hole and lastly every vote that are tested every speech that I feel we have to de centralized power of the federal government at those powers back to the states that the people with those powers always bald\nThe government is broken it's dysfunctional it's disconnected I'm sick a career politician to put the people that charge again\nAnd that's with every week as we have to restructure this government\nGross it's a pleasure I it was a pleasure to help your four years ago and my help wasn't nearly enough I Hope that this time the next time I talk to you after the November election that you are the next US Senator from Mississippi\nThank you so that means a lot and they just keep your prayers and de loop outta work and we do it one day thank you for everything\nI look forward to a Senator Chris McDaniel is who is now a state senator running for the United States Senate\nBlind to get your calls at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven and if you want to measure of where America is going right now consider the me too movement consider the movements that\nOpenly opposed the choice of American voters in President Donald Trump and then consider this brand new poll reason magazine talks about it they asked Americans about political correctness\nAnd the point was made well he'll regard almost Ninety I think it was eighty nine percent well that was eight percent in November sixteenth bought the summer of Seventeen Donald Trump's approval among black Americans\nWas twenty three percent not quite three fold greater than what he got just six or eight months before\nAnd then he said well where's your gun this you're clearly he's been painted as a racist bigot\nFor the last year and a half by the media his ratings can be very good no they're not eight percent they're not twenty three three times higher they're thirty five\nPercent more than four times the support he got at the polls in sixteen and I think the left has looked at that said we're in trouble we bones these voters or at least that's their attitude\nI think toward black American voters we all these people and they're they're going off the reservation they are now supporting Trump I mean what am I going to say\nWhen it goes from thirty five percent to say fifty percent by twenty twenty for the next election I think the Democratic party is going to lose its mind\nAll right so I Want to give you some data points to harm the the number of votes that ... that block Obama got\nA in two thousand eight set a record for the number of blacks voting for Democrats [noise] it was it had been approaching a higher and higher earning number from all the way from Ninety two to two thousand eight guess what we've seen it go in the opposite direction\nRock Obama in two thousand twelve set a record for nominee among black voters actually it's true for everybody but he's the only president to be successfully reelected and receive fewer black votes than he did when he was first elected since\nRoosevelt you name the candidate whether it was a Republican or Democrat\nThey always managed to get more black voters the second time around what did those black voters no well here's what we got to see in two thousand six\nDays if you just look at black men\nThey gave Donald Trump third team per cent of their vote if in fact\nBlack women had voted the same way that black men did that would have been nearly a thirty year high the truth is we hadn't seen this divergence we didn't see it in two thousand twelve two thousand eight two thousand four fish divergence\nYou gave me some stats that are accurate about the overall numbers there's been a spike among black men for Donald Trump and for rejecting progressive ism that most in the media aren't even wanting to talk about it has more than quadrupled\nAnd you can imagine the effect tours all of us I think react this way if if there's someone I highly respect who comes out and says I'm In favor of something I'm not going to avoid the I I I won't ignore the facts\nOn the ground I don't always support what those I admire also support but it's the facts are there and you know right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship for a little leaguers\nThose I admire also support but it's a factor there and you know right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship for absolutely ... percent increase in New black businesses in the last Eighteen months and then record low black unemployment and then a couple that with admirable\nFigures for both black Americans and white Americans they ... they're going to be people who look and say well Connie likes the guy may maybe I should too and that may just pushing them over and I think that's what the Democrats are so concerned about that they are losing what they thought was a guaranteed piece of their electorate\nIt was the message that everyone was supposed to understand ... don't worry about what you said don't worry about what you feel just believe if the progressive socialist agenda is being pushed forward you're better off\nWell here's an interesting data point three of the five worst unemployment data points for black occurred during the Obama administration guess what\nFive records for unemployment low is in the bureau of standards have been recording it within the department of labor\nFive have occurred of the lowest unemployment no we have set records in America for the number of people in just the last Eighteen months who went on their first ever they family vacation than a decade\nYou are not easily going to be able to convince black people that\nThat doesn't matter and how do I know because Iraq Obama got fewer votes among black

I think the president can do to stop what the fed is going to do ... ... you're not going to stop nothing he can do to stop the borrowing or the interest on the bombs ... there's ... ... on the regulation of tack\nAs more of a Congress thing what can the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China\nAnd he said we're going to you know meet uh\nWhat can the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and he said we're gonna you know meet a yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that\nThe stock market is tempered today is the hope that of a deal is going to be done yup yup oh yeah because you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people

might be how she defends herself which by the way well she does well that would hurt her because she was trying to position herself as somebody who is by ...\nSo just assume that okay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties because keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented\nA by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose above politics and work with both sides actually that was not the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he\nMoved to the left they didn't move to the right to be clear bought a book\nOn that on on that point she is trying to position herself an appeal to the people that might have supported the John McCain\nRight yeah I looked up\nCuomo can get away with saying conservatives aren't welcome to New York right yes even the ones that are there because we know that I Am and writing and just being on you get a you can get away with that\nNew York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right and you can be a Democrat and say look I Know all of people are nuts everybody here is crazy and we're not right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might\nBe a little bit different in Arizona that's that's where the differences because you had essentially to\nA historically speaking\nAnd soft Republicans I remember he said he'd rather than an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in the state yeah that's a huge number of\nPeople New York's a death either by the way um you know this and this is that said that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience ... gun rights it's my rights\nUh yeah the gun doesn't average\nOut even doesn't that doesn't have the right by a gun has no right to gun doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers it's the people's right yes\nA very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete yes\nAnd you can come at the design I've seen I don't know if this was in place in Vegas just yet but the design I've seen it also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk 'cause even embedded into the counter like they do they uh they actually have like a\nA if you go up to a bar and the gambling city of for those who don't gamble or never been when you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and video [laughter]\nTo be clear you mean they're not giving anything ...\nBy the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you losing video [laughter]\nTo be clear you mean they're not giving anything free now that are that are just that they don't just buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no I'm the those if ... if they [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like\nBut but for the bar it they'll move away\nFrom ... oh man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about it we didn't talk about Houston didn't we\nDidn't talk about and we did last week well I mean you know if you think about remember the old and I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine what would make your ... yes yes\nI was go back to the Terminator two security guard making the or it was a ... that went to make a cup of coffee didn't work out too well no it did as key to walk up behind them and then became him\nWhich was weird but you think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it you know and\nYou know the type it in a you're going to answer your credit card and then all of a sudden the drinkers are going to be made\nAnd even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\nBy automation\n... you know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas\nAnd also from uh the bar rescue you're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till\nI'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ... ... ... where they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register\nBut even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right where robots not going to do that well either one but I did here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same\nThing I'd ask John tap or how far can you go with a robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots and just a person walking around or do you have to her is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar ... and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can be\nAngry either MBNA angry bartender or get can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you do with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not\nCommunicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar so my wife and I uh recently\nWent to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel\nNow we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it because it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards were animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right ...\nWell in in the case of a a a Vegas and in a in a bar setting there's a couple of\nSettings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting in night clubs are huge in in Vegas\nUm where they don't care they just want to drink it's not your pub rioting where's that where the bartender right things to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that it's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers\nOr uh like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol ah it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot\n... uh it'd be interesting to see\nHow far this go I Want to be alive when they come out with the whole version of the robot bartender uh yeah when you walk in your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert\n... vodka or whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol but you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and you say Alexa give me a screwdriver there you go oh ... and then she hands you\nFelt you\nKnow like the ... I made out of the whole idea of God and then it's as liberal alcohol Alexa drinking alcohol aids and like I Want to get drunk [laughter] eight six six\nNinety red eye engine report is brought you by Detroit ...

very high quality supplements that early available through health practitioners are now vitamins of course very popular I'm On the retail market\nUh the news can tell us a little bit about how to gird

Hoffman by the way congratulations on Thirty years of broadcasting amazing\nThank you so much and thanks for a noticing that yeah it's a it's been a long run and I guess you know what's what's reshoring about that I mean personally exciting but also really speaks to A People's interest long term interest in this type of information that you know so much to flash in the pan right I mean you as an educator you know that\nYou know we started out way back when and you know who knows where the industry was going to go and now it's are so popular in mainstream\n[noise] it is and uh you know regarding immunity you know people are suffering colds and flus I I'm myself them are getting over one right now\nAnd you know one of the problems is so many of us are unrestricted diets\nI've seen figures that somewhere between twenty and twenty five percent of the American population is on some kind of restricted diet whether it's paleo Quito or a vegetarian or\n... or kosher or a gluten free there's so many of these variations but whenever you're on a restricted diet\nYou're restricting your ability to get certain nutrients are the some of the classic ones are are vegetarians with vitamin D twelve or omega three fats or\nOr you have the people and the Quito diets you might not be getting all the nutrients they should or restricting carbs or or fats or things like that so ... uh with that in mind we're not necessarily getting all the nutrients we need to be fully functional and to be able to resist these challenges\nEspecially during seasonal changes in times when we're moving indoors and exposed to more people\nYou know so Neal you know that there's been a lot of blowback against supplementation lately in fact you know some a media reports that say well multi vitamins are really yeah we used was a kid can you respond to that a critique because many conventional doctors are now taking that attack\nYeah but that's that's really a myth that if you get all the nutrients you need from a healthy diet without up limitation because the food tables that were built by the U.S department of agriculture in Nineteen forty our way out of date they don't reflect the current food supply or the way that people are choosing their foods\nOr the way foods are process today and so they're kind of imaginary numbers that I mean imagine that we're getting everything we need from our diet if we eat and the ideal diet\nWith all the options that were choosing not to eat a lot of foods and the\nNeed for bridging those gaps there's nothing better than a supplement than a lot of negative reports are saying that dietary supplements and multi vitamins especially do not prevent cancer or heart disease in short term studies\nThese are not short term developing issues and people don't take multi vitamins to prevent cancer and heart disease they take them to bridge nutritional gaps which is a logical sensible thing to do\nMhm what what are some of the star and nutrients when it comes to a immune support it and I'm thinking particularly\nYou know people who are uh you know maybe they have medical conditions maybe they're on medications leader interfere with nutrients but also you know older adults who will you know it's a big deal when somebody whose Seventy five gets a cold or flu it can really knock him back\nIt is and the first thing I Would always recommend is a multi vitamin because you get vitamin a he had vitamin D you get vitamin C. vitamin e they all have roles and immunity you have minerals like selenium and think that have roles in immunity\nSo if you get the basics then you know you're not deficient and the body has resources to have defenses against these illnesses we've known for over a hundred years for example that vitamin a deficiency makes measles more aggressive\nAnd there's more recent research showing that viruses react to a lack of nutrients in the body and become more aggressive they can even mutate in that body and become more virulent so or the ability to resist depends largely on nutritional confidence\nThey need now taking an example of that might be selenium where they found in a part of China where he was they were selenium deficient that to see 'em V. virus which theaters in serious virus but usually recover from it or if you're nutritionally competed other can result in in just a horrible cardio my office

if the ball is led and the cameras not on then at least we've got a direction we know we know it's getting signal why isn't the camera powering up now it might be that the camera's not powering up because the ground which is terminal five the black white wire at the camera\nHas got a bad ground heck we could put the ball the cross five and six\nFire it up bald lights up the ... lights up and we've either got a bad camera or problem and the radio display but at at at least we've got a direction the majority of the times are right when the camera just outright fails it's a camera or right on a on a percentage basis and kept the eighty\nPercent of the time it's a camera failure or barring the you know the person didn't wipe the lens clean and we forget that that's actually a camera lens you know there's what's on the lens ... what's being an industry technical term you know that that that's affecting vision um so you know just keep\nThat in mind getting a feisty when I'm getting a fuzzy excuse me for interrupting when I'm getting a fuzzy display I still hear the signal like I'm getting close to something\nOkay so that makes sense ah yeah so it's still it's still able to detect the sensors are working which is a different part of the system those are the sensors in the ... around you know that's the that's the park assistance or that the I forget what the actual I Know Ford is bliss I forget what GM's acronym is for\nEverybody's got a different you know we're going to college this this week\nUm I like to call it the I Can't turn my head and neck and therefore I'm blind and so I have to back up based on sensor system\nBut um you know we don't do that uh but yeah let's let's start with wiring it up like a very simple you know go to your local auto parts store owner or some side marker Bolger some kind of a ball and socket and ... power to the camera I've got power to the camera that taught me half the circuits work\nAwesome uh last thing I got it fits related but all of a sudden my remote start stopped working world one I have a mechanic for Easter were what ... what can I Do check fused\nFact factory remote start correct so it's a gym so it's a it's a three button or a transmitted right he's got a lock on lock and you've got a little circle arrow button at the top correct okay\nSo I'm a General Motors for example the first thing I Would look for is a bad ... which I Know it sounds weird huh [laughter] wow yeah really yeah the yeah they yeah well think about it they don't let you use remote started the hoods open\n\nRight interesting they they won't let you use they won't let you use remote started the hoods open course I Can't imagine why somebody would have the open and want to use remote start\nUm you know there's [laughter] so it's that's you know if it's got a bad if it's got a bad ... through most start won't operate 'em and typically you would get a warning but depending upon how it failed it's just one of the things I look for it's a simple thing it's just a characteristic of the system\nSo you know it would be going with a scan tool does the lead show in a closed position if it doesn't show in the closed position then why not and that's gonna that's gonna prevent I started for more I got ya um the next\nPlace I Will go is does the beach the end of the body computer show correct input to allow it to allow remote start to work

winter\nOr in another quick question about hires um how how long ... in your opinion you know let's say you don't hit the mileage whatever you know the warranty is\nOne should you be thinking about changing your tires you know what you see a real world situation now how long do they last\nYou know I think the industry and I'm trying to remember the day there's it's six years that it it it's somewhere between six and eight years and I forget the number off the top of my head and I should probably no shame on me uh but it's six to eight years in terms of you know beyond where the point where the tires considered safe anymore\nBut [noise] you know that's not my only barometer tires to me are a very unique individual thing everybody you know people will come to me and say if I buy this tire\nHow many miles like get out of it I don't know what do you do for a living\nYou know how often you gonna rotate them what's the balance how often are the tire air how often is a tyrant pressure check there's there's a half a dozen factors that that extenders short and the life of the tire\nThen I've had cars with Michelin which I think is a good tire dry rotten two years because of environment and then I've had you know cars with some of the cheaper known name you know off the shelves tires that last you know seven years again because of environment it a lot of it has to do with environment\nI think when it comes time to pick a tire I think you've got to also consider the fact that we are you going to be when you need that one replacement and\nHow easy is it going to be to get that one replacement I always encourage everybody you have to ask the question is this a very new model tire that you're selling meat or is it last\nYear's tire or two years ago model tire that's why it's so cheap and nobody seems to understand that you know if if if Michelin makes attire for whatever reason you know it's a model a and it's it's a hundred and fifty dollars and three years it goes by and they're phasing it out to bring in the model bees\nNow than a hundred and fifty dollar tier is now a hundred and twenty five people will go well save the twenty five bucks I'll buy that model be tire\nBut is that because er that model a tire is is is is that does that mean that two years later when they suffer a flat those model a tires are no longer around because they've been phased out taken over by the model these which have a slightly different trade which don't allow you to mix and match them together\nTires really got to be complicated when we had all wheel drive front wheel drive\nAnd traction control little things that we it at the cars over the last Fifteen Years tires became a very technical involved conversation that used to be a you know there was what how many tier choices were there in the sixties\nWas a good year Firestone Michelin Don lab tiger paw ... how many how about you I I don't think there were six or eight tire companies in the sixties and I could think of off the top of my head that were real tire companies per se\nToday you know there there there's so many tire companies are so many choices there's so many different styles of tiresome retires all season winter tires\nYou know it's it's a very complicated involved involved conversation look at us we just been eight minutes talking about tires and we only we only scratch the

I think it's modular masters dot com if I had to make it if I had to take a guess that it's been awhile ... you know whether they can do older things like that I don't know I Would say that if they can't do it there's got to be someone that's you know dealing with older\nOlder components such as that it's it's a question of you know finding them and then I'm going to tell you that if you can't then you know start stockpiling that part get one or two of them and even though it's the best sport bad spot that's the that's the that's the fun of a hobby right Bob you get\nYou know felt the joint that it's been in both directions does it have good loose feel to it is it fluid\nIf not it's something to look at\nJust just to take it over to chart the only thing well you're right after ... go ahead you could\nWrite right after we um put a first gear on it ... seemed to get better but you had to kick it up to about a after we you know for the air out of it by working it back and forth twenty times without any pressure on\nHis seem to get better and all you had to do is kick it up to about two hundred Darby engine it would just take off and turn but then when you put the wheels on the ground it wouldn't do it\nRight because you've got it and the way to the vehicle testing it testing it without weight on the system\nRight doesn't really tell you anything for it\nSo then we put another gear on right and flushed everything and we've probably put a gallon and a half of floated through this thing just flush it out just to make sure right\nAnd so basically this time after we got it out and put it on the ground really hard guns stared at all either way\nI just thought maybe there was something that you might know about the makings or the workings of that fan motor because it's got you know like two thousand and one of um controls the van fluid going through and the other one controls the steering assist\nThe way it coordinates to the diagrams we've printed off that we were able to get because you can't really find a real ...\nBut ah can you send me the Vin of this vehicle can you email me the vendors Seventeen ... then I can do that\nUm rotted car doctor show dot com I Swear I wasn't going to do this again but I got to do it I got I got I got I got to see this wiring diagram I don't remember I remember going back Eighteen years I just don't remember the steering having an effect going through the hydraulic one but yet throughout all of this\nThe the fan motor still has operated consistently in the same correct uh yes\nSo it's it's still kind of lazy and then when it turns on from heated it it blows and it stays it stays cool and it works properly\nRight right um now after you put this last year on and bled the year do you have power steering now no\nYou you don't have perished you're either direction no but with the old gear you had it in one direction not the other right at the ...\nWere they were the original August your share one way and then it wouldn't lock up all the time it was just wanted just every now and then but I did check for recalls on those steering gears in when this vehicle was made\nWhich I Can't find them Neal date on it because somebody got rid of my label either off the door or somewhere right we can't find one with the bill gate there was six hundred and thirty six these units or the vehicles they recalled and the recall was for they had nuts\nThere was six hundred and thirty six these units or the vehicles they recalled and the recall was for they had nuts it was coming losing the scaring gear and then just lock up when you're going down the road\nI Would think by now that's been done but the the easiest way would be if you take your Vin go out to an age TSA dot Gov right and plug it in there if this vehicle has an open recall that will tell you\nRight you know not go out to knit so now I thought after this long it probably would make any difference now no no uh recalls always recall yeah Dale\n... they've gotten very fussy on recalls in the last in the last five or six years that wants to recalls on a vehicle that recall there until it's either resolved with a vehicle or scrapped but it's it's one or the other or a a recall from what I'm told stays with a vehicle for the life of the vehicle period right so it\nWas only certain build days and we don't know the ...\nRight and I you know the fact that the vehicle worked fine all this time and now the problem happened right or you know not to mention do who's a rebuild or is it is it an after market rebuilt car don't\nYeah I knew you were going to say that [laughter] I just knew it brother uh you know a one car don't they've got their issues and I don't I don't want to pick on the company and say oh it's got to be the rack but when it it it makes me suspect it really no he found\nOne video on YouTube guy replace three of 'em and he went to the junk yard and got one and it worked right yeah\nUm so I Would suspect the fact

because my sons also in the auto parts business and he manages a car crash store and the mechanics said traded off [laughter]\nWell I don't know if I'd trade it off but I Would definitely you know
