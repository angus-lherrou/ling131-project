final half hour my favorite part of the show 'cause we are just cram a lot of lightning round stuff in here so I'm excited um we do need to leave though with the president and the cell phone report which has him if you don't know about this we'll get to an all night\nLong back in ... oh\n[noise]\n\nYeah but\nRight now for judge a map of some ...\nTo protect syringes from sludge of extreme temperatures but you know it also protects our troops are put each purchase of metal bowl synthetic reaching a\nThese mysterious a essentially cell phone emulate is replicated is\nThat had been discovered in in orbit around in their mobile they can come and go and disappear I get I don't think we've heard everything I don't know if anything has been intercepted if there have been any confiscation or arrests or you know whether anything been kept secret but the technology is out there\nIn order to intercept\nAnd according to the New York times piece or speaking of Trump he's been warned repeatedly that the Chinese and the Russians are listening\nWhen he's on a cell phone\nWhether it is a personal iPhone or are they continue using until last year and has held on to primarily because it has phone numbers lifted it\nBetty couldn't store in the new one\nOr whether it's the government won all they can do is strip it down as much as possible a government phone those are not secure or you can still listen to him he was warned that this was a problem and then he is often ignored the warnings\nHas gotten better about using the securing land lines and using the switchboard phones that is true but this has been a long an arduous process\nAnd that was Maggie Haberman responding or this morning she was on CNN\nAnd that was just her friends were from being on CNN this morning and then of course I read you a Trump's response or that he's calling it out and he's calling it's fake news I said I don't know what\nThe actual reality is but I don't think it wouldn't surprise me are shocked me the president's still uses a cell phone and we'll have some\nInteresting conversations on the cell phone I I Hope he doesn't do it but you know I I'm guessing maybe he does or has so the New York times piece says that Trump has been pressured into using the secure White House landline more often\nBut he still has refused to give up his iPhones Steve Wynn\nWho only resort in Macau is among the friends of Mr Trump the Chinese hoped to use to influence the president\nPresident Trump is two official iPhones that have limited abilities that a third that is no different from hundreds of millions iPhones\nIn use around the world or some of the capturing here uh when Trump calls all friends on one of his iPhones the gossip gripe or solicit their latest take on how he's doing American intelligence reports indicate the Chinese spies are often listening\nAnd pointing to use invaluable insights into how to best work the president\nAnd affect the administrators and policy\nCurrent and former American officials said\nMr Trump said said repeatedly warned him that his cell phone calls are not secure and they have told him that the Russian Spies are routinely eavesdropping on the calls as well as the Chinese but aides say that the vulnerable president\nWho has been pressured into using a secure White House landline more often these days they'll as we previously mentioned has refused to give up\nHis iPhones\nJust hoping that whenever he's armies phones that he refrain from discussing classified information when he is on these\nAnd just hoping that whenever he's armies phones that he refrain from discussing classified information when he is on these phones\nIs the crumbs use of his iPhones was detailed by several current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could discuss classified intelligence and sensitive security arrangements the officials said that they were doing so not to undermine Mr Trump but\nAt a frustration with what they consider the president's casual approach to electronic security\n\nAmerican spy agencies the officials and had learned that the Chinese and the Russians were eavesdropping on the president's cell phone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepting communications between foreign officials\nI mean if this is the case I mean there is a scary stuff I mean this this this is one spies are made them this is what you know espionage and having foreign agents crawling on our soil this is what they're trying to find that wants to try to gather\nAnd less than truth be known we've got spies crawling all over the world is well we've got operatives everywhere and I hope we do\n\nWith the president really really pissed off about this obviously are hence the two tweets from this morning and I I just don't believe that the whole story is fake news I'm sure there is a threat of some truth\nTo the president using the cell phones and again I just hope that if the Chinese or the Russians are listening in that\nWhatever is talking about is of no value whatsoever you know even if there's no classified information though the claim is is that the Chinese and the Russians can glean and gain some insight\nOn the president's ah conversations is discussions his demeanor and then maybe as they suggest the way to approach or manipulate or how to deal with the Trump White house and\nOf course I I Want to give the Chinese and the Russians nothing\nI understand the dangers I understand the threats\nIf I were told don't use your cell phone you the president and you are a massive target for inception trust me I Would not be using the cell phone\nI Would have an all warnings that I Would abide by my intelligence officials automatic like this Chinese and the Russians folks uh their meddling they continue to mental meddling as we speak they got the mental up to the midterms\n\nAnd I've said for years on this program that I think that we're going to have a a coming of war with China I think it could get ugly I think that at some point we will have a military confrontation I'm not saying it's World War three but I think that can be a nasty nasty confrontation and potential war with China\nI've been saying this for for years on this program almost two decades we started the show in two thousand one I've talked about this uh as far back as I can remember\nAnd to bolster the point\nThe former commander of the U.S army in Europe\n\nSays that it's likely the United states will be at war with China within Fifteen Years retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges\n\nHe senator Warsaw, Poland security forum yesterday that European allies will have to do more to ensure their own defenses against Russia\nOr\nAs we need to focus more on the Pacific and and the Chinese he said I think in Fifteen Years it's not inevitable but it's a very strong likelihood that we will be at war with China\nThe United states does not have the capacity to do everything that it has to do in Europe and in the Pacific to deal with the Chinese threats\nAnd this was a military times report and again I've bought this for a very long time and I also believe that our military infrastructure I Am also believe\nThat this is a big problem and we've got issues\nWith the Chinese a side will let me prioritize and\nSay hey get as much as I can on in the final minutes here on a on a Thursday here on that uh I don't know if you saw this but the Senate Judiciary chairman who we saw plenty of during the Kavanaugh hearings Chuck Grassley today\nHas

this bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were devices sent to a total of ten different addresses now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America\nWell I think was that the\nAbandon with which the media got out in front of what we know about\nThe sensitive which so far is not a whole lot um it was really

trivializes this kind of terrorist behavior to suggest that it's driven by\nUm something along those lines it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say give all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clinton the Obamas and to CNN\nI guess is not a far jumped to say well maybe it is politically oriented whereas if it had just been random targets\nAre kind of like uh the the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski than you might say well we we don't know what's driving him except that apparently hates technology\nYeah well I I'm not at all has it in a bad that laws I think that we're now\nAt a ripe enough points in what's been learned about the investigation that we can clearly said as a political motivation here yeah um but we will be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not and whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my faith\nIs not that you draw a conclusion that some things politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggest that the president's guilty of incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America was actually\nA convicted people or at least one person of incitement in court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult ... in the courtroom as it should be\nBecause we have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech\nUm but you know courtroom proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally regardless of how skilled the demagogue\nOr ... or ... you know some other skills speaker at a rally navy and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up\nAnd they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us and doing to our country nobody leaves from that to say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit mass murder attack well maybe they'll decide to go ring the doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and it showed up some ... you know\nA bomb people into a\nA into oblivion oh well\nThere there might even be people who say I went out and punch somebody in the face because I was so far to a political rally but then when you try to turn around and say hand it's not my fault I didn't actually cause at the person who riled up cause did\nThat CNN buying into a a kind of I'm not responsible for anything because the guy who was talking to me and saying words to me who inspired me to do that and I look I Andy I've covered some cases they uh\nUh what was a wide area and resistance case where a\nTom Mets gr are inspired people to go out and and be demand adept with baseball bats because he was black\nUh I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say you had to say\nI'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color\nAnd and they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that ... that held up on appeal but was CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's fault\nTwo days after the New York times published a uh uh uh some assassination pornography in the form of a title story about the assassination of Donald Trump and then there are calling for unity in and closing the the the divisions between has its its rank ... I ...\nYeah I look I I completely agree with that they look large there's there's a doctor in a law called fighting words mhm uh which is an exception to the first amendment or it's it's over the years\nAfter another law called fighting words mhm uh which is an exception to the first amendment or it's it's\nOver the years then cut back on an awful lot says the Supreme Court recognized as in Nineteen forty two and there's a lot of good constitutional law experts who think that it's a completely moribund a doctrine but what it basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful to you and your presence\nAnd you know turn around and uh and and clocked me I'm On account of it um you know I had a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I insulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say\nI'm the doctor and has been cut back on a lot in recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attend a political rally and then you uh you know you go away from the rally and you have some distance in terms of time and space\nTo think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act and we say it's the it's the fault of the person who's rally you went to the simply it it it essentially says that you have no agency for your own behavior which is just ridiculous\nWell Andy I I you know on the non lawyer near the lawyer but I've read that case a you know years ago because I I thought this is interesting if you walk into a bar and say something so vile\nTo a man about say his girlfriend or his wife said it could be the verbal equivalent of a punch in the in the nose and you might arguably say for something that bad you might you might get away with punching him back\nFor his words but but I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician\nBut I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder\nMaxine Waters Hillary Clinton you know and some other allies like Madonna fantasizing about blowing up the White House that if they want to start going out in identifying people who said let's go out and do violence because of this presidency you're going to find a lot more offenders on the left a than you are on the right the right tends to be pretty\nI don't law abiding I think mostly conservatives are but where do you think there's going to go we got about a minute left in this interview and\nI think they're going to capture the the person or persons behind this pretty quickly large there's an awful lot of forensic evidence that they have and unlike when I investigated these cases Twenty years ago video is now ubiquitous so I I Would think they'll they'll capture this guy in very short order\nShould be interesting because it's awfully tough to wrap those\nGay marriage had been imposed on fifty states by the Supreme Court and people are talking about polygamous marriage being being allowed by the courts how about religious liberty we used to think that was fundamental\nNow you've got you've got Christian businesses getting sued into bankruptcy 'cause they won't take part in same sex marriages\nFree political speech the left used to be for that now if what you say make someone feel unsafe the government can step in and arrest you for it and finally how about the idea of academia seeking objective truth and letting a free range of opinions you know be on campus even if it hurts people's feelings because that's how we find the truth\nNow they're they're silencing free speech on campus and all those things\nThe left walked away from the American consensus and embraced extremist views and now they're screaming at us for being fanatics because we still believe what we did when Ronald Reagan and George Bush and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton and Harry Reid all agreed on all these things we didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed in now let me ask you something since you and I are on the same page I think on just about everything every time I've talked to John I'm Talking to John ... from the stream and you're going to read this piece he's written\nUm if we were to draw just as hard as you and I could\nCould we come up with any kind of similar ... the list or or something like it I Know you I don't believe in the artificial moral equivalency were once liftoff ... both sides but if you tried to find out is there anything that the right has walked away from where it was on the same page as the left Thirty years ago\nI Can't think of a single thing honestly\nNow I Know you're thinking and go thing when we were not calling for America to be a monarchy or a Christian government we're not calling for people be put in internment camps were not calling for\n... race all supremacy we're not doing any of the crackpot things that they're accusing us of there they were just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacist evil heterosexual\nThey were just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacists evil heterosexual heterosexuals patriarchy patriarchal monstrosity so the last to move the goalpost out of the stadium and they're calling us lunatics 'cause we're still in the fifty yard line\nNo do you think that some of this the divisions caused by one side walking away from the consensus points is what's causing all of this turmoil lately violence in the streets bombs sent to a bunch of of liberals a political liberals and we don't know how many more may be on the way as are delivered in the mail\nDo you think some of that is because we're we're putting Americans in ... in a position where the two major political forces in the country\nAh one has walked away from the table in those dozen or so items and and that leads people wondering well then what am I supposed to do a riot when they're no longer consensus\nAlso another item of consensus is when you lose an election you accept it yeah\nBut but the left didn't accept even\nThrough bomb us and I know that much in two thousand eight was supposed to be a permanent fundamental transformation of the country that the election twenty sixteen that was me a formality like election in East Germany where you just certify with the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary\nLess was outraged this was supposed to be a permanent irreversible revolution under Obama so they really think\nThat they're under foreign occupation by foreign enemies that's why they have to have a resistance resistance is what you're doing the Nazis occupy your country not win Ohio votes against you\nWell and I know this happened when I was a little kid and you weren't even born John ... when Nixon you know said\nOkay I'll concede the race there were folks who said no no we could fight over this winter we could win this one you know because there was probably cheating on both sides there were certainly cheating on the Democratic side she said for the good of the country I'll do that I think that's what the left thought was going to happen\nIn two thousand with Gore and Bush and they failed\nAnd that drove them crazy and lately that that sort of\nWe're going to rush the barricades and they'll they'll simply open the doors for has happened with Kavanaugh when they said well we're going to throw all this stuff down they'll cave in and Republicans have finally grown a spine and said no we're not doing the cave in thing anymore and get over it and I think the Democrats realized\nThis is not going to bode well in the years ahead and probably not two weeks from now either\nThat's right that's right and and I hope all your listeners are going to vote in the national impeachment referendum on November sex 'cause that's what it is\nIs really what it is because we end up with a a Democrat controlled house not even the Senate you know they'll go ahead and tried to impeach Trump even though they don't know that they would get a conviction and the sun and they'll do adjusted to so they can say they ... they can do it and say you\nGot one of Trump's Kavanaugh and the whole cabinet and probably Mike Pence they're going to be complete obstruction is our government our the process of government will come to a halt and we'll be some third world banana republic in chaos for two solid years ...\nYou've got to read this ...

A. dot Gov which will be a a place for veterans to get\nInformation on everything from health care to education benefits you know the last time you know and I believe we talked about da ... hundreds of eight hundred numbers hundreds of of links to different websites that that made the process of actually\nGetting in to the system almost unbearable so this is the first of a a two pronged\nAssault that we will be making on that the the second is what is going on right up there in the Pacific northwest in Washington state and later in Alaska where we will be a beta testing\nThe electronic health record which will for the first time connect a veteran from the time that he enters the military processing center as a young recruit the time he walks into it to be a net will revolutionize the way we provide ...\nWhy don't why do you think it's taken so long to get to that when you would think that the people working within the ... system would have said we wish we had the same kind of capabilities that you know the average or a retail company out there in America has right\n[noise] well I think laws and it's something that you you talked about for years I mean you've made your living on on the preaching free market ideas increasing preaching the notion that uh if we are going to have\nA fish and government just that is possible it has to be closest to the people that government serves and a BA has been a typical government institution there are hundreds of thousands of good people who joined VA\nBecause they want to serve veterans but they've been held back by uh nineteenth century process season regulations and a beautiful thing about where we are today is that we've got a president who does not\nCare about what went on in the past I mean a a I think somebody else was called the great disruptor but he certainly has\nWhen it comes to the the system and he's he's not going to tolerate business as usual\nWell and so secretary well OK I'm sure that some people are going to hear this is a great computers that's going to cost a bundle of money but at the end of the day does it have the potential not only to deliver great care which is what we care most about but also potentially to be more efficient and less costly than the current system\nIt it does it does in the sense that it will provide us rapid\nScheduling it will and this is the most important part in the president will be announcing reforms to the state of the union in January this will be the basis for the opening of that ad\nBut sure when it comes to veterans choice and health care and that's the ability of the veteran not to be taught\nThe opening of that happened sure when it comes to veterans choice and health care and that's the ability of the veteran not to be tied to a system that\nMay be miles and miles away from his home it's going to be a system that in many cases almost all will allow that veteran to choose whether or not it's better for him to get care closer to home than\nIn the VA center I'm that's what's truly revolutionary about what's coming and the beauty of that is that\nWe do have a consensus from\nThe Congress they've given me as the secretary the\nAuthority to create this new system the president is on board and you know it's right in line with with our philosophy of government a government that serves and his in his singularly designed to serve or those people we are mandated to help\nWill secretary well can you tell me this 'cause I imagine that most of the pushback from any of these kinds of changes like allowing of ads to access private medical care from the system that serves the rest of us I've had veterans tell me themselves that they had good results by going that way when the VA has been willing to pay for it but I Would imagine\nIt also has the potential for some VA employees to lose their jobs have all of a sudden you know all the local hospital the local civilian hospital is doing a lot more of one kind of procedure another and it's not being done at the VA center that means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that have you managed to conquer that part of the problem\nRight well the president has been very clear about um the relationship with\nWith arguments when he has\nSaid that there is no prerogative there's no prerogative for Iranians or any other group federal employees in general um when that prerogative comes in between a veteran and health and\nWe have said that clearly the president has moved course we're now hung up in the courts\nBut that's to be expected a you know we we're we're blessed with a lot of dedicated work but um we are very clear that a million members who are medical professionals in VA\nIf they're going to stay the way they have\nTo devote their time to taking care of patients not spending as as some do\nActually many some nurses doctors spend a hundred percent of the time doing the work that's not what are the veterans expect that's not what the public expects them that's certainly not with the um the president of the United states demands\nLet me ask you about something this is another issue that came up and is now than you'll Bedford Forrest I remember that name from both you know junior high school and high school there was a portrait of that man who was a Confederate general uh he but he also became the KKK is first figurehead Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd one of your employees a deputy director of zero VA off so small and disadvantage visitors utilization had that portrait up in his office but he said I didn't know that he was connected to the KKK and so they've taken is down you know on one hand I understand why somebody who knows history that well might be offended by on the other hand\nIt just seems like this is where we're scrubbing every bit of American history and most of our history is filled with people who would not be politically correct by today's standards\nDo we end up scrubbing all of the history and I wanted to get your take on on on the fact that there was a little controversy about this\nRight well let me tell you how I was arrested now of course is not always um this individual or pictures of George Washington and what have you been in his office right as soon as someone complained he took it down so there's there's no complaint with the impact\nHe he removed it um and\nThat's what he did write I'm I'll tell you how I'll address this um when I was a for confirmation or there are several members of Congress who are demanding\nThat Mr Lincoln's words from his second inauguration a grade that ... where he says that we shall take care of those who have borne the battle and his widow in less than a be taken down from the VA really um I actually have\nIt's been all in the news this is what they want to get Trump for for the non existent Russian collusion or right they are section three of the federal criminal code but but James Buckingham couldn't make it to section three never got\nAll right they are section three of the federal criminal code but but James Buckingham couldn't make it to section three never got there oh it's crazy there's no way we can go after the sanctuary cities it took me six seconds on Google on Google defined accessory after the fact\nWell and and you pointed out and I remember the fight\nWe're Arizona's said if you're not going to enforce the immigration laws we Arizona will under a good governor and the Obama administration fought it tooth and nail and at least in the corner one and they want under the premise that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws\nAnd you would think that that that would make it very clear about the other thing that occurred to me you're a lawyer as you point out in the column\nAnd if we pointed out before but isn't there an equal protection issue here I don't suppose\nThe rest of us who are legal citizens of the United states could bring a massive uh you know go to

I was drinking too much and decided to quit the booze [noise]\nNow you'd almost think that that kind of answer would get you more plotted that it would critics but no that was one of the October surprise in any case is this the October surprise I guess it'll depend on who it ends up is\nResponsible for those bombs if it turns out to be somebody with a Muslim surname I have a feeling that's only going to amp up the president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives\nThen you're going to get the Democrats doing something really\nOdd and really two faced because they will say well\nIf this was a conservative than the blame goes to Trump\n... which is a bit akin to saying well if it's a lefty who commits an assassination or commits a terrible crime then the blame falls on all\nLeft days and you understand there is a double standard in the media about that you can cite example after example where the media will say well just because this happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone and they especially do that if you have\nAn act of terrorism carried out by somebody who's a follower of Islam They say you can't blame all of Islam for the actions of one member of Islam\nBut boy if one person with a gun commits a crime than all gun owners are suspect that's the double standard that we routinely see from the left wing media and believe me no matter who they catch and I expect they will catch somebody fairly soon involved with these bombs or devices most some of them were not active\nBombs at all they were just devices made to look like bombs no matter who it is I think that CNN and MSNBC and the New York times the Washington Post will try to find a way to blame it on President Trump let's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind tonight\n... or ... years love yeah thank you very much shrouded no problem I got I got out of a question that's becoming a cross my mind for a while with with all the rhetoric cholesterol and out inciting violence on cable to kick them while they're down\nYet you go on and on called day does it ever make you wander it's been making me wonder are they are they is the ocean for another civil war I mean they're either all people from other countries\nYou remember the Democrats lost the last civil war ah [laughter]\nAnd and the Republicans won and thank goodness for that uh but but are they pushing for another and by the way they'll tell you all those weren't the Democrats have today\nOh yes they are now we can you watch a couple of the national Susan movies and you'll see the evidence and I\nHave to give great credit to punish for being able to do that but do they want another confrontation I think they think that's the only way to remove this president and here's the case I'd make they demanded in September of twenty sixteen Donald Trump you have\nTo say that you will accept the results of the election not demand came from none other than Hillary Clinton and yet at the same time reporters weren't asking Hillary because they didn't think it was possible Hillary as the election doesn't go your way will you accept the results of the election they never asked the question\nAnd why because nobody nobody in the mainstream media thought it was going to go that way I did I thought it was going to go to Donald Trump and so did a lot of other people and obviously enough Americans voted for him that he won the presidency and they went nuts on the night of November the twenty sixteen they said we can't accept this result\nAnd I've always been proud that I live in a country where there's a peaceful transition of power or it has been up till now and we said you have an election and no matter whether you like to results or not\nYou accept the new president and if a sitting president gets beat after four years you accept the new president and if a president served two terms I think at this point Donald Trump is the odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away\nBut they went nuts and they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have\nTo impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not but in this in December and January\nThe Democrats vowed we will never even let him take off as we will find a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office and then we got past the inauguration and they burned a few cars the left dead you know all the pink hat wearing ladies burned cars and ...\nWe got past the inauguration and they burned a few cars the left did you know all the pink hat wearing ladies burned cars and ... you know variety to the streets and I didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have\nHim investigated for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians\nWere going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections and I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that could be the last minute October surprise ... hold it till after the election\nIf you hear stuff starts to leak before the election from a mall or investigation this will prove the point that a lot of us believe and that is the deep state is at work in America and the deep state has benefited both the left and the right at various times if Mueller's investigation leagues and the parts they leak say\nHe's going to announce after the election that Donald Trump has been involved in some kind of collusion\nLook they've been running a collusion hobby horse for two years more than two years now and they haven't way new law well I I don't care if it went ten years but the the real test is and how long it when the real test is have they come up with anything\nOf the house of representatives will change or if that does happen um the Democrats have said look this tax cuts that the Trump push through last year the majority of it went to wealthy people that's not fair we're going to reverse that I'm\nA ... a hold on to reverse that a\nDoctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\nYes um that's what they're going to have a very difficult time doing that a\nParticularly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't won't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves even if they don't raise taxes\nOr they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward consumers rather than business the last tax cut\nThe the purpose of it was to increase economic growth and then indeed that that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital he did that\nBy reducing corporate tax rate\nFrom an average of thirty five percent down to Twenty one percent and\nHe or reduce personal income taxes for everybody including the upper class and the upper classes the one that creates new capitals so the first tax cut was geared to economic growth um there is a feeling that\nThe the higher income people and they did made out better than um middle income people so now Trump is pushing um another middle class\nTax cut if the Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died if the Republicans don't he's not likely to get that and I think the uh uh investor community is saying\nA look all the things Trump has been doing to stimulate growth which appear to be working I don't have a difficult time keeping that up if the house of representatives with\nDr ... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation but the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast\nWell what is too fast and can we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing we we didn't have much inflation during all of the eight years of Obama before making a birth to come to it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive\nAmount of growth if the fed would stop crunching the economy\nYou know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that are exact point the twelve month inflation rate for the last couple of months outs higher than Spanish and the two point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we've\nPushed interest rates up new home sales the last five

up falling in the bottom of your house yeah we do with whether it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard if you want to hear Claire McCaskill's\nAd that radio ad that she started running to Missouri the Democrat and the Democrats\nAre calling other Democrats are crazy Democrat ... not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show I Albert hey good morning\nNot one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on rather Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] yes I think an oversight committee and get your message that won't happen so [laughter] yeah I Will have to declassify it uh yeah well they now have you know that the the things that I ... and and yeah thanks\nThat's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with it a ... it's a it is fascinating though because it is something look at isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today some part is going to ask because the was are where the bombs Leiber\nNot right where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a\nYou know about the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible but also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in\nIn the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch and and they see something worth these devices ready to go off could they have been detonated\nA rapidly either remotely or by opening a package I think that's information that needs to be made a available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself\nIf possible ... ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the ... down I think was at Fort Point four percent yesterday\nAnd yeah yeah uh the\nUh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more a company has come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the terrorists in retaliatory tariffs by trade partners as having an impact on on business\nSo overnight as it is up and which I which you might expect ... all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a\nShanghai up a little bit above ... percent there uh Europe a mixture of over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry we know there was in the housing market and we know for example about you know Ford coming down\nAnd and say look thanks for all the things for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and ... something like what happened yesterday in the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possible do you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen\nWe it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening or as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the markets very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and and that's something that was you know was was brought up a yesterday by you know some of the experts saying look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity right\nYou know just to disrupt the American you know an electoral above a process or it could be just terrorists yeah who have decided to do it and again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if ... if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled and then go law\nWell because I Would think that is ... there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by the handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail\n[noise] yeah because we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days\nThat they would want to get that message out and and we will be hearing that\nI Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at ... someone's going to have to answer them for honor attracts usual forecast\nThose heavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly you'll need the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south\nTheir or state you know more what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time but it was interesting too so I understand\nUh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we've got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging or not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact\nThat the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time [noise] because if you if you believe as a Democrat [noise] that the tariffs [noise] that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned it\nTwice [noise]\nOkay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we ... we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd said this when when the uh weight before that we said this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terrorist message [noise]\nThat Trump has been so loud on ... ... ... ... why are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time commercial about [noise] when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly it on\nYour and your your your really your on your ever are on the work\nYou're not if they're All right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong or the stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of people to go to the gym today and best\nTime to go or you know but but that's it if they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have\nMentioned the crazy Democrat twice and oh by the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't or I Can't think of his name uh didn't he ended up running for da\nJak yeah jak\nRan for Diego he was he became the da da da da de ... is the fact that they they ring or are in their office the whole time that we've always talked to weight loss named them on TV about getting me and I drink a lot of I think if they drink all the time after application win or lose trying to run their drinking at the end of the day\nAnd they're often not wine like right ... it was hard liquor they're always renting we thought and so when I heard that I went\nCome on come on if they're if they're prosecutors they drink a [laughter] but but yet when we get getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that\nBecause we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term ex dream as Democrat yes ... leadership of the Democrat rush right\nThere's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the in their internal were showing\nThat this was in the bay you know this was a way a hot button or that they could connect to\nThe in their internal were showing\nThat this was the day you know this was a way a hot button or that they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats\nThe ... that's that's why that was huge\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of call not research response that you get because there's there's no other way there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really\nNeck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so I I think it's it's um\nA clear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise what from the capital the problem in that is for her actions specifically with with capital because in siding with her party Kavanaugh\nYou are condoning that kind of behavior and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nAnd and and this kind of situation that is that it's going to and could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a ... if you look at these September polling a you know as the CNN or McCaskill was up by by uh by three with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was up until a was nine twenty nine to ten to and\nIt was a tie and then you know at\n... through that whole time the cabin all thing and ms misery scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters and holy up one still margin of error is to point seven uh and still nobody has said the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided they're\nUsing that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad ... by the way apparently took top other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mindset you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of\n... a ... from fringe\nTo extremists too I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy\nThat is the mindset that they view when a significant portion of undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means money you'll compromise with Republicans in [noise]\n[noise] yeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent\nIs is is this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board\nBut then [laughter] it is bipartisan we in danger of and I mean she's giving she's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given but those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those\nAre the ones that may vote one way or the other insurance for one party or the other ... and they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses ... that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of that weakness if if it didn't help create\nWell you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can\nUh the the uh\nInsults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't death and he's mentally ill and all that but you know you can look at the end you say okay that's that's an intact it's always thrown at at one

to do that's right and make notes they know like a football coach ... worked what didn't work and we'll talk about this at halftime coming up yes\nWell I Would agree with that well senator studio was signed up with one of these suppliers and he had a bill he was being charged seven cents a kilowatt hour or so he thought and we made a lot we did our work in Connecticut to change the bills for now when you look at your bill you're supposed to feed the rate that you're being charged\nFor the next month when you look at it so we looked at in ... he was being charged seven cents he thought that was a pretty good deal\nBut then when he got his building next month he realized he had been charged Thirteen cents almost double\nYeah yeah I'm a while and significantly above the standard offer rate so when he started looking into it he realized that he had been given the wrong way by his supplier and that this was happening to other customers in Connecticut as well because\nThere was not there still isn't a really effective way to make sure\nThat the rate they tell you they're going to argue and January is the rate they actually charge you in January\nWhile it's just so Ellen and again you kidding I mean this this is for real [laughter]\nWhen I first met a lot of progress yeah to center city I was brought a lot of attention to this the billing system you get your bill from either ever sourcing night illuminating and the billing system wasn't really isn't really set up to notice if they they tell you in January rate for February\nThey aren't really set up to notice that they tell you the rate they're going to charge you isn't the one they actually charge you so senators Suzy ... complaint with the public utilities regulatory authority Cara\nAnd so now we got a a recent what we call a draft decision from them saying basically to the suppliers and to the utilities\nWe got to change the system and so that will be done and within about six months or so and you know unfortunately in the meantime consumers that to be aware if they're being a sign up with an electric supplier\nThey got to really be checking their bills and make sure they're getting charged the rate the next month that they've been promised\nState consumer council Ellen Swanson\nCats you know something listening to you this morning you're the kind that we need in governor but I'm telling ya and and Lou is another one that we need that kind of government and we would be a heck of a lot better off\nOr thank you it's an honor to serve the people of Connecticut\nYou know a Ellen ...\nThis is nothing new I mean we've heard stories over the past several years\nAbout people frankly and and I'm sure you'll agree with this who are\nWho are confused about this a lot and look I'm not here to disparage any supplier year but I've heard from you know folks like you and other other consumer officials saying you know be aware of using these\nThird parties suppliers kids are going to try and make a profit somewhere and I still remember this is just me speaking I'm not as busy merging anybody I just don't understand why people ...\nYou know they think they can save a few cents here but if you don't get it directly from ... or from you why you see we always seem to hear about these problems now and then\nAnd save a few cents here but if you don't get it directly from Seattle and the average wars or from you why you see we always seem to hear about these problems now and then\nUnfortunately the that the people who market for these third party suppliers are very very persuasive and a lot of times we see it's our senior citizens and [noise] um are are\nA row income folks people who wishes and their first language are being targeted and so\nAh you know with somebody calls you and says I'll give you a twenty five dollar gift card if you changed your prior to me and\nI promise he'll save money [noise] you know that people don't believe in them and we've seen their stuff then filming investigations that we've been involved in and and the a lot of the price of paid a lot of money and fine\nBut we don't have our hands around it and we it's just I don't know if it impossible problem\nYou know I got a a I got a card and I got it on my desk\nSame thing same thing when the thing\nTo do it wasn't it wasn't for this kind of ... it was approved by yeah\nAbove but this is to switch because you're a senior yeah yeah of course so the hope is out there ... yeah yeah\nBut we've done a lot of research on this market and what we have found that\nOver a residential consumers who are in the market over on Seventy percent of them who contract with a third party supplier pay more than the standard of standard offer a ... for a one year like from September two thousand Seventeen through August of two thousand team\nThey overpaid to the tune of thirty eight million dollars and that's real money coming out of people's pockets that they really you know what I mean you don't need to pay extra for electricity\nOn rarely eight yeah I mean yeah like a\nState consumer council Ellen Swanson cats Ellen thank you so much we appreciate it absolutely\nNothing about by you know by by this is the need is you guys Ukraine's crazy and and I don't understand why and and if people are still a little\nConfused what we're talking about here you know the state has two main power company C Olympiad resource and you are so you would think OK I'm ... and they're a handful of towns that have their own power companies but those are only nine or ten\nSo most people will say okay I get my power through ever source or for you on a Brad they have these third party companies\nThey come to you and say well we can they come to a lot of unsuspecting people\nAnd say time yeah and say well we'll give you cheaper power because they buy the power wholesale from the main companies and they hook people they give them a lower rate like Ellen just said for the first couple of months and then they end up screwing him\n... ... ... lives last month so their bills I don't understand why Brad these third party operators are allowed to operate I don't get it\nI don't know why they don't have especially yeah electricity products like this year a controlled yeah you'll they know exactly what's going on they don't they showed\nThe state has been dealing with these these ... like like

that's right I Want a job they do what a company this is ... what a ... whether you're Catholic Jewish proud as it doesn't matter ... memorials\nYou know Brad it's amazing I mean it wasn't that it was probably what three four years ago where where if you now it's changing across the country I get it but you know three or four years ago\nIf ... is the the the the push in most states to legalize marijuana was below fifty percent oh and well looking at now sixty seven percent in the states it's really it's it's in yeah ... yeah you know what it is rather it just I think people see I really think Brad people feel\nThat the ... you know the horses out to the bar now the cat's out of the bag you know I never you know I really thought that we could be that but we you know listen I ... and again I I\nKnow people I listen I'm all for letting people do what they want with their bodies were they want to but again the fear I have a ... was it was it was a two prong fear I have number one is again there is no real way to check or test\nFor real and toxic ... they're developing a device\nThat would use a ... a saliva test in the field not a not a cardboard ... not not a a a sensitivity test with district but something like a breathalyzer so they're developing that number one the other thing is you know there's a lot of research now rather says that\nThe smoke of some marijuana is actually worse than cigarettes so it's not the panacea everybody thinks it is\nYou know absolutely it it's just a crazy yeah Twenty one that is after the hour of eight o'clock let's go to Linda in Windsor Linda good morning good morning limited morning on\nThe show and it gives me hope or Connecticut or let them comment about what you're talking about it and the cat it depends on how you ask

with legal we before we are tolls was kind of surprising to me surprise surprise people don't want\nYou know I Know well you know something that is something that that I Believe is in the mix your because people don't want to also I think you're absolutely right on [laughter] they'd rather sit home and get high yeah yeah\n[laughter] kind of comedy as you're unlimited time on the other night and it was in my town which is Windsor all legal women voters in North central Connecticut and it was all the candidates running for a legislature who were part of their district\nOverlap the town I Know

behavior\nAnd she's an educator who spoke yesterday Brad ... hometown yes and she wants to talk to us about will do kids really have less self control or not and a cat and good morning\nThat morning thank you so much for having me\nHow was your uh how was your address yesterday where did you speak\nIt was wonderful I Am this gorgeous brand new and young high school bell thing I did I talk at four o'clock for educators at seven o'clock for parents and really had a wonderful set of conversation there aren't there by height the and he said that for early education an empty out\nAs you talk to those kids as you talk to the kids what did you think were were were they the way you thought they would be\nAs you talk to the kids what did you think were were were they the way you thought they would be for do they come on a different way you know\nI heard a lot of stories on yesterday about kids and and feel that are very similar to the stories I've heard across the country as I travel talking about my book and about his behavior and more and more teachers and parents are seeing just\nOutright defiance from kids they're seeing kids who can't seem to resolve their own problems who won an adult intervened to negotiate and then you know the really extreme behavior flipping that's silver her saying and kids who are really just\nDon't seem to be able to they have the way that they're supposed to end the school setting\nYou know Kevin ... in a short time we know draw all actually the the the sixty four thousand dollar question here [noise]\nOur kids are less self can ... than they used to be are they are they less mature it it is some of the violence and bad behavior we see is that exaggerated has always been there orange really worse than it's been in past years\nThat is exactly the question I wanted to ask in this book because I was also skeptical I'm One of the key statistics I found from the national institutes of health study is one and two children will have the mood or behavior disorder by Eighteen flat anxiety depression ADHD something's addiction and I want to know is that just\nOver diagnosis or more awareness maybe than twenty Thirty years ago and the other really chilling statistic I found is looking at the suicide rate from the center for Disease Control and just the last decade the suicide rate for kids tend to fourteen years old has doubled down on a forty one percent for kids sit in the Nineteen\nI and I'm pretty young I I don't know about you I was I was fortunate to have a happy child who was to but to forbid a cat and you know the phone and rabbits that that a ten to fourteen year old ... they'd be so upset that they would think about killing many lives is mind boggling to me to me it is\nYeah it's really sad and and scary for for us but I think it's this mandate to parents and teachers that you know these little upsets\nThe kids to melt down like\nThose are problems we need to solve when they're three or five or seven teach them how to manage their emotions teach them how to be capable so that they don't get to be twelve and hopeless and on social media all the time and not really having any skills to deal with their feelings or the way that they interact in the world\nYou know ah when this may sound corny to you or your husband for ... I Believe one of our big problems in America today is the family\nI truly believe it's the family that they're not together for the little things Hi mommy Mm Hi daddy yeah that kind of thing I I Believe that that is missing and that is one of the problems that we have yeah yeah\nI agree I think that that connection in the family just being together not feeling like you should be working or on Instagram or doing something else that says that ten Fifteen minutes a day that check in with your child to just be present with them\nAbout eating out on everybody eating eating dinner together at one around the table right ... yeah yeah\nRight and and it doesn't have to be I see families now who deal with family breakfast\nAnd dinner can be a hard time with schedules but you know a lot of people can take twenty minutes sit down and have some cereal have some ideas together and that can be a connection time so more and more I I I Do the families trying to get\nBack to the point where you know you're not all just running around and you're able to be that source of support for your children and then you don't feel bad if your kid melts down because you enforce the rule and you're able to say you know what I Love you\nAnd these limits and these rules are part of that love and it's okay if you're a ... I'm not going to melt\nAnd and then the kids learn okay\nI'd not these big emotions are the problem there just something I Need to learn to manage my parents are scared of them and there's so much fear and parents today we're here they're scared of doing the wrong thing they're scared of being blamed for how their kids turn out and we need to hear it from a place of courage so we're not just\nReact yeah we're not trying to do something to cover our ourselves and that we're actually leaving our children and creating the characters that will sustain than in life\nAnd you know so the gathering there's nothing wrong with selling the kids that you love 'em for\nYeah yeah yeah that's sort of the foundation\nAmazing how many now adults that you and I talked to we read about famous people who say you know I knew my mom and dad loved me because once they provided\nAll too we read about famous people who say you know I knew my mom and dad loved to me because of what they provided but you know my father you know there's a lot of our guys to get my father I knew he loved me but he never said I Love you I mean that she's a mind boggling to me you know\nYeah you know one thing I'll say last night and and you know there were\nAlmost as many dad in the audience there were a mom and that's something that's a wonderful development on kids need their father they need their mother but they\nThey need to see that that could be nurturing that they can be die and mentors um and ah and yeah and some of the stories that that parents shared were wonderful that parents and and it's a new role for dad so it's not surprising that they're sort of finding their way but um but I see a lot of hope\nAs long as parents can be confident in their own ability to lead their children and that this is important that you know yes we all have responsibilities and it's hard when\nThis is a very very important case in that what the Supreme Court said to all of the lower courts was you should defer\nTo the decisions of the agencies the regulatory an administrative agencies as to the powers that they have actually received from Congress\nCongress issue statutes make statutes agencies then are empowered by those statutes but the question is how far does that power extend according to the words\nThe statute and traditionally the way the frame or thought about it the courts would decide that\nHow far the powers of the executive went based on these statutes but in Nineteen eighty four in this very important case the Supreme Court said to lower courts no no the ones who have the power to interpret the statutes\nAre the agency's themselves and you should defer to their decisions if those decisions are reasonable\nSo they horse so they changed that gave\nThe agency that gave the agency's tremendous latitude to extend their powers beyond the actual words in the statute\nDid you ever read what was there and know whether you you obviously read some of the opinions of that case what ones they are thinking in in in in insane that Peter I mean uh if you can break it down away from lawyers began here what was their thought process going on there\n[noise] well it it really came out of uh some\nUh ideas that were developed in the late Eighteen hundreds I'm calling for the progressive movement in the late Eighteen hundreds wanted many uh many of the agencies\n... one of the people in agencies who were disinterested intelligent um and capable of managing the economy\nAnd that idea while a was came came from the Eighteen eighties Eighteen nineties through through the election of a um [noise]\nWilson and twenty well in Nineteen twelve up to the new deal that\nWhole period of had great faith in the ability of these very intelligent people to run the country in effect and that's why [noise] in Nineteen eighty four the same ideas\nI'm kind of infected if you will the the Supreme Court\nAnd the Supreme Court decided that it ... it was much would be much better for the country it'd be much easier if we just allowed these very well educated credential disinterested smart people um to make these decisions for us that's got to stop\nBut again when you look at that and analyze that the people that were elected\nWere the people the people that these people knew that these people trusted and if they had something that they wanted to get done it would get done and what ... what happened and I and I think it's tremendous that you wrote this book is to let people know today that\nThat's not happening and it is in having\nIt isn't happening now the good news as you know I Hope you know is that we're a Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme\nOf the good news as you know I Hope you know is that when a Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court barren out five justices on the Supreme Court\nWho are a\nConstitutional as they understand the way the constitution was structured\nThey understand why it was structured that way and they understand where the authority ought to be to make the rules there you go out and I believe that they will be modifying this Chevron case ... while the case\nComes to them so that that is that is the good news this is a problem we have today but it's important that people understand that it's on its way to being ... if the court does what I expected to do\nAnd the reason the book is called judicial for the food is that when the court does these things that will be a tremendous\nAmount of blowback oh of course by the U.S especially by the last\n... off yeah yeah I Will send more fake bombs yeah yeah\nYeah [laughter] they want the decisions made by the ivy a administrators in Washington because those are the kinds of policies they like not necessarily the policies that the people at the United states would vote for\nThe name of the gas the name of the book rather is a judicial fortitude our guests Peter Jay Wallace and Peter and um you you you mentioned here that Alexander Hamilton one of the founders\nCall the judiciary the guardians of the constitution budget your opinion they have failed and we can see what what you're arguing here\nHere's the question why was it was it a lack of fortitude which we could phrases other things we won't do this morning or or was it just pure partisan politics on members of the judiciary why did they fail\nWhen I think it goes back to what happened in the new deal um there was always this sense in among some judges\nThat that uh the uh Congress was providing too much power to the regulatory agencies that that was inconsistent\nWith the constitution and in Nineteen thirty five in two cases the Supreme Court decided to strike down to laws on the grounds that they provided the president with too much power\nUm the next year and then the election Nineteen thirty six FDR won a huge victory an overwhelming victory and he retaliated against the court\nUm and threatened to a point seven new justices make the court\nThey're member that he wanted to add all this is a classic jak Roosevelt wanting to pack the court yeah\nExactly exactly and now that was not successful but people didn't like that and it didn't pass Congress but it it scared the court\nAnd and and after that uh in addition a lot of the members just started resigning and Roosevelt between Nineteen thirty seven in Nineteen forty one appointed\nAlmost all the members of the court he points about seven members of the court plus\nA chief justice and so\nAll those people who he appointed where people who had grown up in the progressive era and also supported the idea of very many um a lot of the power being concentrated among the administrative agencies where they thought the really intelligent credentialed\nDisinterested people would\nWould run the government\n[noise] um so now you're seeing how that connects\nTo the decision in Nineteen eighty four of the the Chevron decision same legal principles same ideas are coming up as far as Nineteen eighty four and being at being harden into an actual decision that allow these agencies to a\nLot of these agencies to have so much latitude\nUm but it's a it was a it's a long process and now and now we're in a position where a different attitude toward the administrative agencies dominates the Supreme Court and they have to have the fortitude\nTo stand up to the ah the ah groups in Congress and in the in the presidency who want to maintain that power\nUh and that's why judicial fortitude is necessary now as it was over the two hundred years when it was not exercise appropriately\nPeter I got to ask you\nNow as it was over the two hundred years when it was not exercise appropriately\nPeter I got to ask you you are interviewed my favorite president\nUh you know who I'm Talking about Ronald Reagan lord of the power of conviction and the success of his presidency\nRight what was he like a well\nRounded rating was Ronald Reagan was one of the most extraordinary um individuals' of course

his\nRoom is\nThe oval office or helping him in the hospital or what I was his council um or a\nPerson who was a member of his cabinet a Ronald Reagan respected everyone he would never raised his

then the Russians were going to have\nTo retaliate ... they're going to start targeting those countries\nAre that's a that's a very direct threat at the same time a U.S backed forces and us equipment

[noise] it is not beyond the pale wasn't remember Russia was literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to do people in Great Britain [noise] we notice so it it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked the we're not real bombs fake bombs\nDummy

and using it\nAs much to visit and is in chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to to do I mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the INS treating because you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the IMF treaty last week\nOn a ... and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria\nIsn't there even the barest possibility\nThat this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time and just to type for it to be that kind of an operation\nBut it is possible I mean what they just ... nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states and I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters all over the former Soviet Union and I I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time but let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about and I agree with you wholeheartedly at the time has\nCome for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries\nI ain't get talk so what does it what does that mean\nAnd and how ... what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with the person chooses against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just\nTwenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations and so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinates of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time I suppose that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which\nIn two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThe you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations it's you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with I have I'm Scott violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national\nSecurity columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the ... show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is 'cause that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I\nHave a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realized that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point in and you and I thought to talk more about this because I was always a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to us\nBut the hottest show dog she was on a show [laughter] so not but my my question I Love the people what they don't understand is that is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about reestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire\nAnd and all you're exactly right until the end of things like me well thank you but you got ... [laughter] I think it was supposed to be able to claim that a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a port roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said to you know really half the world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later I got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them that destroyed them\nEconomically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strength it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and as you want to lose in the Bahamas or their their entire administration on down the ones that clue to go to Russia and still probably are in some ways\nA ... you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump to associate cetera I mean there was\nIntricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so it's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good working and doing that I listen to how I get in touch with you want I Want to talk Russian whether you're\nA well I can always go to ... dot com T.

cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and\nSo uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefits are real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in\nA in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians are really want is they want chaos\nOf my thank you very much for the call listen when we come back\nOn because I Do want to talk a little bit about the primaries and a couple of folks have asked me to talk about the caravan and the chairman situation or we are going to talk about that in the last hour the show are going to be joined by Steve Cortez a because it it all fits into what's going on here\nBut we're going to be joined by state representative Katie Arrington uh she's from South Carolina she's running in the south Carolina's first congressional district\nI Want to talk a little bit about what I call the fly over a fact\nUh how we cannot discount what is happening on the ground in these states in a whole host of areas\nUh and so she was going to be joining us we're going to be talking about the mid term elections where are we talking about what she is seeing and hearing on the ground there but in the meantime you can get them to treat me at Andrew underscores anger on Twitter you can call in eight five five forty Laura I'm Andrew ... sitting in for Ingram here on the lower income show\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that loses Tom Kelly studio a biology teacher making every American safer from the effect divided up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip\nWell and and listen and we got this uh on on the Twitter line here I'm at\nAndrew underscore linger on Twitter from an imaginary Adam on Twitter the only bombs we should be talking about is the caravan bumped here's here's one reality right and again the the thing that makes America great one of the things that make makes America exceptional is that anybody can come here legally and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation\nThat being said\nSecurity is an essential aspect\nItaly and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation\nThat being said\nBorder security is an essential aspect of sovereignty if you don't protect your borders you ... the only McChrystal General Stanley McChrystal not some you know right wing bomb thrower was on CNN this morning talking about a ... he was asked about the Caribbean and one of the things he said was that a\nA a up the border security is an essential aspect of sovereignty\nAnd your it's clear your constituents and their potential constituents get that why is it that but what is your opponents say about this I won't get our power how would the Democrats in his district taking this\nSo I I don't it Joe Cunningham rough and mayor of Los Angeles gar SETI\nHere to campaign wow do I need to go any further\nDo you really you really don't I mean that that seems that you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard city from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\n... it's just because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the call right yeah Democrats don't have a platform\nThis year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact\nThat we have the ... economy we had in generation ... the lowest them wind that amber\nAnd if people don't see that they\nI I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country they are toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be\nWe should and proud and strong had gather as a country\nMy ... my justice South Carolina state representative Katie Arrington choose the Republican candidate for Congress than the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody will it's obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them or because of um uh uh because of the other things that are in the news is fake bombs story\nA and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter a President Obama when he was an office said we were never going to the GDP above two percent of the Trump McConnell is turning that around obviously this is very important to\nOther folks are talking to they see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets ... how are they on those sort of the the Trump ... tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly oh love more money in our pockets of Trump the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path\nWe need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class get permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that\nThat is that's going to be a huge focus on going into the ocean but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area of bowling being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people the tariffs\nNo one likes to tear up no one likes the tariff\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the world's best negotiator left demand do his job\nYou don't need to regulate it got\nNo no go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd think well I get ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we do them in the\nFundamental belief and I'll give Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit because he told me and it's been part of my ... a Democrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republican believe government is the problem and that\nIs what I'm doing the government's the problem you getting rid of it finally we got Congress working with him on that and we have to keep the momentum going at paramount as my\nMy colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove your walk from their lawn and he's already been a little bit that sort of my one of my other Bailey works is is the is this issue regulations but but you know and it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and\nAnd and Trump [noise] um I I have a I'd formulated a theory on what I called Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a fondue thing the friend your rules of acquisition and\nRule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table right we're number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and rule number three\nGo away from the table right we're number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nThat you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the great folly\nOf of ... you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years is that they've always print negotiated and eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we are you understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on let's say a looming them or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is a negotiating tactic to take the strongest positions don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day it's going to be a little bit cranky for a minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick or we have\nTo prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really is\nOur country group we are the greatest nation on this planet because the hard work perseverance and the guts to stand tall and we need to do that right now China is not our friend\nThey're never going to be our friends you know that we have a president is going to stand tall against\nThem I guess you know I was going to ask you about about how your constituencies sort of looking at this this foreign policy but I really want to focus more on substance here I mean what about what is your what is the sort of your ... response when when he talks about do you mean he literally I'm assuming he's you know\nFor the rest of the Democratic playbook which is to undo all of the great games here\nWhat how does he proposed to housing for both of the ... the economy jump started\n... ... not that smart the only thing he's done the only thing he runs on as he walks around he says I'm for offshore drilling in South Carolina well yeah no one is because there's no oil out\nThere that the only thing he he is\nRunning on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina\nWow ... ... ... ... and well number one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job that the president were put that aside and then he comes out with he's the only one who's had bipartisan experience well the only thing he has experience in doing is lying to some people about offshore oil\nGetting them to enjoy them otherwise there is no one he has nothing I debated him it was it ever get to a point in your your you know in an argument with somebody and you're down and there's just no response from them and it was my debate with this guy by the term Democrat\nYou need to get below suspending his campaign ACLU and he's raised on a money so your listeners are out there I Need help ... dot\nCom on and do any support you Republicans wherever you live across this country the port ... can candidates we need to stand strong together and not let this\nYou know and I don't even called the blue wave I just have to say that they knew that the blue

are in connection with this bombing\nUh both Fox and CNN are reporting it as a federal authorities are ever arrested a man in connection with packages I'm a and then a law enforcement to those Fox law enforcement source confirms one person arrested in connection with packages\nOr MSNBC is saying a one man taken into custody for questioning\nA different sort of ways of looking at this we all know the listen narratives can be made depending on how you how you spend these things are they're saying that it's a a man in his fifties or there is an auto parts store that has been cordoned off that's what we know right now\nI Will find that interesting Kate Baldwin on uh CNN or was just talking about a\nA a devices or the question is whether or not they would depending on the political um the political connection of this person whether or not they will call them bombs or whether or not they will backtrack and call them um you know fake devices or whatever however she referred to it just a moment ago\nIn the meantime this hour by the way we're going to be talking about the caravan going to be joined by Steve Cortez he's a scene and political commentator\nPresident of a of a president

Am Andrew Langer sitting in for Laura Ingraham today on all more anger him show taking your tax taking your phone calls actually taking your tweets at Andrew underscores anger on the phone number here eight five five forty Laura listen so yeah uh uh yes I've you're tweeting and asking me if I Know that someone has been arrested yes I Know\nThe FBI moved very quickly cover up other trucks the van that they are in common with a tarp a there is well you know something I'm not going to speculate looked fairly we're all sort of sitting here we we um we noticed that there may have been positive Trump stickers on this van that's being taken and so so we we have to we have to sort of take\nAll of that listen here's what I Know I Know that up until they zoomed in on the stickers on the truck remember MSNBC been saying a person detained for questioning as soon as they did on the stickers\nAnd there was some indication that the person may be a conservative or maybe a Trump supporter that's when MSNBC change their their uh their their teaser there at the bottom a man in his fifties arrested in connection with the bomb probe in any case we're talking about this\nAre taking your phone calls so you're a let's go to a Ross in Arizona Russ welcome to the warring from show [noise]\n[noise]\nOh you're adult you're doing a great job or talk to you about the St ... so called caravan ways and I think I have an answer the answer for President Trump who's been loaning the disgraceful laws which the Democrats passed which is tied his hands\nThe answer is in plain sight all you have to do is they got your dictionary and your constitution and uh [noise] because you know words mean the absolutely of course\nAnd ... every definition of the word invasion this is an invasion check your\nShower no absolutely I Believe me I've I've seen those dictionary definitions I listen to it as a force of large numbers coming to try to cross the border illegally believe me I I get that\nWas once a month that let you go because I I I Want to get John on before the break off because he's calling in an answer to my earlier question John you're a former postal worker you can help a elucidate us on this uh these issues [noise]\nDid you say John or Sean I said John John good yes\nOr no worse yeah average it's the same yeah I\nI I was I worked for the postal service as a a color can I fill in postmaster for ten and a half years after my uh twenty seven years of a air force service\nAnyway this is not that unusual when you consider the characteristics so these packages [noise]\nUm I don't I have received things in the mail personally that are the things that are more into a calculator or something with\nStamps on there that have not been cancelled wow the reason or knock Andrew is because those are called SP ours which stands for small parcels and rules they can't go through the processing machine or\nWhen you get a letter that goes through the machine\nA machine just spray it the cancellation on there for efficiency and speed it doesn't do that with those types of packages had those packages had a\nPipe and they're not a PVC pipe but the actual lead pipe or something that could do damage yes it would have way too much and it would've alerted people that there's something wrong with this so it's not a gun through clerk\nClerk at the counter will look at it ask a bunch of questions and canceled those there's a stamp\nShore so\nAfter the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nWell let me ask you this and ... who are running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWell I think that's probably a a they're basing it on the fact that one of them was mailed and then ended up with a Rick being returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly sure how they got FBI is a lot more collaborative and I will say\nWell this is this an listen I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information and in the end right I mean we can speculate I can offer my opinion I can\nWell this was an old so I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information it in the end right I mean we can speculate I can offer my opinion I can offer my perspective but we're also in the business of providing facts oaks Sean thank you so very much for giving us those value of a a great weekend or\nSomething oh no expert but I think are underwear no from work and you know just to be dangerous to make us all more dangerous for\n... that was when we when we come back\nWe're going to be talking more about these issues were going to be joined by the court does we're going to turn our attention to the Caribbean we're going to be continuing to take your phone calls a at a a five five forty Laura also your tweets I'm Andrew longer sitting in for a ... show\n\n\nHave you ever taken your car for an oil change in your mechanic find something wrong and surprise\nAnd it looks like that's going to happen to these countries and the reason that's important is right now under US law is crazy but if a Mexican comes across illegally or he or she can be repatriated almost immediately but if you're not from a continuous country shore um Central America that's not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed\nUm but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across a through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of the travel ban but I think ... here's the bigger point I don't want to have\nThat confrontation less incentivized Mexico and find somebody else me kind\nOf threatening or threatened Mexico to take care of his problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like on this issue and they have gladly pass the buck and allowed and even facilitated these caravans to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them particularly a train\nSays it will happen I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which she'll have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece\nAnd they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their content it was ... ... it's interesting you talk about this is talk of the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Want to say it's a high five I don't remember I thought I thought that that goes north south I think it is I tend interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea of someone constantly walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me it it then I'm thinking as he was relative\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic a\nYou know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of a lawless for of course border here's the reality the president wasn't far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners of\nFor example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know and this is a conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from some far right a website the Laredo station on the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred Bangladeshis\nAre crossing illegally not why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from Bangladesh I'm there with us also happens to be a country that has\nA real problem with Islamic terrorists\nSo there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think is very eye opening shore and tells us you know that that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught [noise] um so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for our national security\nIt's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico to do their part\nWe need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way that doesn't work\nIf it comes to it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope you don't have to get that trick pony in but I think that option has to at least be on the table\nAnd do it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get better ... but I think that option has at least be on the table so that we don't have the prices of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for his interstate eight this south of interstate ... is right along the border in in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it it's funny because I I come back to ... you

are currently on getting baby that number killed 'em but we also have an eight month old daughter and so we're not quite to the college saving yet\nUh but we do have grandparents that instead of buying on Christmas get their birthday presents would like to put away for her college savings and I'm just wondering what's the best way for them to go about that\nUm I Would go ahead and open the child and you say an educational savings account how much money are they talking about that they want to put in the\nReally decided but growing up I was getting savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I could I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each Earth Day and age Christmas I'm not sure\nOkay All right well you can open some mutual funds ... two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there is a thousand minimum to get them open\nOkay but you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an E S say it requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of the ... be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of a view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account so that you\nCan and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you're just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money together maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that is a lot of help thank you\nThank you for joining us America lodge a is with us in Singapore\n... how are you [noise]\nI'm busy part well thank you very much and good afternoon how are you going to get a better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nYeah so our first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together\nGreat um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that I'm ... and ...\nSo I can put up to thirty five and seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and that would get tax relief on that without going through your ... which translates to about four thousand dollars a factor mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand jumps gosh blowing it from my salary mhm\nOrder the penalties for withdrawing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what you're\nYeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need\nAn fire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand a month to keep taking Fifteen thousand and put in for that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency finding about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built that because I feel very comfortable with having ...\n... and what is your income a year\nAbout a hundred and sixty okay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about join she three thousand\nOkay that will be three so that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month okay\nSo you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\n\nYes but I'm not a citizen I hear I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my ex patriots and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my furs and ordering the mhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra well so what happened and that's why I feel what happens if that ... that event occurs of while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\nSo it's very unlikely\nThere's a while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nThat it's very unlikely um I just received than your role at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe and my work life\nMhm okay\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bother me\nIf the proper amount to have in your emergency fund is thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no don't drain it down because this is not an emergency\nYou use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund which means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later so you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is\nWhen all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back\nWhich tells me you don't agree you know you've got ... in your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think\nIs what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement don't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies and don't monkey with it\nAs merge and she found is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind\nSo you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around and so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nAnd thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I Want to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run the type of ... that that may be your advice dawn [noise] ... model to maximize ... on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that\nThat come through our training to do that is it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that uh because it's it's very much\nUh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours and the day for enough money to equal a good living and I it can be done\nBut are coming straight out of school difficult to I'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart visceral prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's ... there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do\nCoach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home you're coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is that really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that\nYou're in a sense your financial coaching them and so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with\nHigh levels of integrity to do the right thing so you might explore\nThat angle because truthfully you can make more doing that then you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as a whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you you know\nSchool as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you you know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah\nJust saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as an exclusive lake but we did you know we started doing events we started having a class we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can fill out an

I started my own business I fortunately and I just saw last year um I'm twenty three year old and I know I Want to do something else on degree narrow um but I didn't have to figure out what that is I Want to do something I'm Talking about\nI mean I have been in cartel to last year hoping that sounded as I Would come out of it related to part but I just haven't come up with anything and ... and so I was hoping you might think about it [laughter] okay\nWell that's very interesting so obviously you love cars is that right is that what I'm getting out of this\nAre you already told me about that what specifically do you love about cars\n[noise] I I just I Love 'em I mean what can drive down but I also get I think that there are so unique in a way that they're\nUm designed and built and trying to gather 'em I enjoy feeling different ones and um you're kind of\nA gun learning more about that and\nThey're All right okay so the ideas you thought if I go sell cars I'm going to come up with an idea for a business to do with cars and you have yet to come up with that inspiration\nSo let's let's look at what you enjoy doing besides cars what kind of work a function task do you find yourself really enjoying\n[noise] [noise] yeah\n\nBack America\nJoining the conversation on today Ramsey show it is our career our taking your calls about who we are do you do would you please do not how do you figure that out and what you get that clarity how to use stuff for my name's Ken Coleman host of the ...\nOf our Ramsey solutions media productions and thrilled to be sitting in for Dave this hour Tripoli eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Cody how can I\nCan think of for taking my call so I'm about five years and she my career field and I teach in cybersecurity and I'm currently make\nA hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed a all of these baby stop so I don't have a wife or a cat and\nA and then they have all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job got is less stable other than a full time and have a approximately three hundred thousand a year a hybrid appear to ... hoping and\nUh I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job\nCybersecurity consulting and ah I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know you'd be on five days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but\nI I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know an off the support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either saying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome or the or the field itself I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going a job but like a Chihuahua or anything like that I I I enjoy it so yeah I Know you opportunity to uh to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half okay two times what you're making OK\nSo where's the stability issue meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work that out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hour earlier it so it can fall things so I you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be out of nowhere close you know months on end\nYeah but you're gonna make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nAll the ... not even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there is some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... not ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position and um and they they say the average um yeah OK yet but they have some months or they they get a paycheck and\nYou know but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat than Fifteen thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty you know a ...\nWith like our position\nYeah or just in this new position 'cause you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money\nAnd take you know my point is is let's say you're getting into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it but let's say you're killing it the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you've got no risk at all 'cause you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I idea to celebrate tonight oh my goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the always is going to love to be work ... right now [laughter] I mean bloody this is the kind of smart ... risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all\nI'm ... ... ... and here's the deal you're saying that ... are you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week and that will put your three hundred K. if you only do it and you're still going to be making about the same as not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so\nAgain go go go oh that is fun stuff AAA eight to five five two to five just as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for dates\nGo to Rachel is on line and Madison, Wisconsin Rachel how can\nHow can things they're talking to

twelve months so first of all that's out there and it's not job hopping you left after six months you've been in the legal world and you now know\nFirst of all that's out there and it's not job hopping suck you left after six months you've been in the legal world and you now know very specifically where you want to go so congratulations of being twenty four\nAnd and knowing where you want to end up so uh the first question you asked me are your skills that you have manifested in learned in the legal industry transferable to the business industry and the answer is absolutely yes\nStew a

action\nYeah everybody in America as well so that going wow that is extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody who can do that [laughter] pick the industry I mean think about how valuable you are

seven million it's historically there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great it's systems in processes and you're really good at

four companies in the ... circle and say I need to learn more about those companies I Need to get in proximity\nNow the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances\nOr who dabble or worked full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well and so you need to take them out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in and so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one\nWhat was your path what are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow up what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nIt was any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive and so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available because this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time it doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is\nYou say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say ... shadow you for a day I'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people and those new people\nWill help you get in the right places are going to open up doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your buddy that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is\nPeople in places so again the folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you [noise]\nHe needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out and find the answers ... when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what

I'm looking at a I'm kind of continues you know I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if if what I got as a hobby or district careers but just a little bit of a back story or what a good paying job that excellent back there to pursue and I thought was my passion I think about ... percent pay cut to to make the switch\nAnd and I went to this new profession you know I quickly learned that I don't know could write a faith I mean I think I might have jumped the gun and I just read it and in fact probably\nWill tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a ... a

it's it's a it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero lead\nOkay why did you jumped into the I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause you didn't plan financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly\nWhy did you jump for this why financial\nPlanning\nSo you know the life of the day for the last ten years

that's what's going on and I don't know if straight commission sales is the thing for you\nThe reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders are and maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this is working in pretty quickly you got to make a decision or and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place

I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy ... there's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a portrait of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned by half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ... but you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and on your husband\nAnd I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that um I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's like I don't want to be paying for something I Do not need then it cuts but you have on it\nIt's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan right up land has now changed yep cause you to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nAre you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings should come as a called a pinch him from my company and that overall is about eight percent of my total as a\nMatter of your favorites or ...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is\nThat would be ... percent of my total assets you know and and the question is whether that is a lump sum yes or ... okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you ... when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of yes\nAre not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone and I think if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay\nAt a rate of about five percent in this current market so it's as if you had\nAn account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and\nWhen you die the money stays with your family\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still out of your dog then yeah you gotta survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them to either race and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a close to to cause that it's probably about four oh well they're total tone that where the assets house hopefully\nWill launch our congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my um my family and my wife honeymooned\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\n\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents I Would I Would typically I'm kind of a point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nInside his home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool because I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell uh certainly you got to ah live well below your means lives they are a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think you can limit\nStupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that [laughter] big\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now yeah I Believe has done or will do stupid\nThings but didn't you can minimize those ... things along the way and\nLive a modest lifestyle will blow your means I'm no Lloyd\nSo do you think it has to be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize the stupid yeah maybe I didn't minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... on the math on that works to your benefit at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death for sure\nOut three hundred grand to have [noise]\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us

see what they do they'll make hay out of that tonight\nFor but here's the problem with that too is I agree with that and if I were if I were Trump would play this thing with this alleged my really really quietly and I would also prior you know for it and say look we're going to offer more protection for all of these political you know a democratic followers and things like that\nBecause I think about it is is that if he keeps quiet on the tweeting\nAnd the longer that this airplane on his alleged of what we're trying to discover here about the alleged bomber\nWe keep them mediate doesn't regulate their coverage on the discovery of this bomb or\nIt could actually end up helping Trump's as long as he keeps his nose clean because my concern is this caravan we're going to have a ... do
