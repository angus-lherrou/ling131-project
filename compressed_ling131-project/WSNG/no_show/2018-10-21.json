across\nThe media or which then here's a sample headlined probiotics are mostly useless and can actually hurt you talking about a click bait headlines [noise]\nUh this is a story that is highly and accurately reported a steady based on a mirror Fifteen volunteers\nResearchers at the Weitzman Institute in Israel gave probiotics to the volunteers and lo and behold they discovered that only in some of them did the probiotics actually\nAppear in their stool samples\nAnd as a result of that they claim that provide acts are useless\nAnd this is something that we've long noted is that when you do is to test on somebody taking certain ... sometimes the robotics don't appear in the stool suggesting that they don't take root they don't colonized a however\nThe researchers themselves readily admits relying on fecal samples as an indicator what goes on in the gut\nIs inaccurate and wrong and I'm quoting the researchers themselves never was a journalist so fit to publish the headline probiotics are mostly use was based on this study\nAnd here's this study that came out just a couple of days ago actually just yesterday to Georgetown University medical center headline probiotic use may reduce antibiotic prescriptions and here's what the researchers found\n[noise] used to provide access linked to reduce need for antibiotic treatment and infants and children\nIt's in the European journal public health and the study found that when the results from\n[noise] it's in the European journal public health\nAnd the study found that when the results from twelve studies were pulled together\nInfants and children were get this twenty nine percent less likely to have been prescribed the antibiotics if they receive pro buyout acts as a daily health supplements I'll take that any day but then they refine their analysis and they repeated it\nThey looked at what they term only the highest quality studies\nAnd then this percentage increase to\nFifty three percent reduction in the need for antibiotic soaps a spectacular result the findings are very intriguing the researchers say quote given this finding potentially one way to reduce the use of antibiotics is to use pro by onyx on a regular\nBasis\nThis according to the lead in a study in best to gator Daniel ... he's the Georgetown University school of medicine and they go on to say we already have evidence that consuming probiotics reduces the incidence ... verity of certain types of common acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nAnd more studies are needed in all ages particularly in the elderly to see if sustained provide accuses connected to an overall reduction antibiotic prescriptions if so this could potentially have a huge impact\nOn the use of probiotics in general medicine and consumers in general this according to Sarah king from Cambridge University who also participated in this study so what's going on here so to provide acts it's purported\nTo not work when you take a probiotic and to provide it doesn't show up\nAnd your stool sample so is it useless then will the answer is but doesn't necessarily mean it's useless and I've got to say that I myself have dabbled in checking my own stool samples using the various services that are available\nAnd mostly what I found was disappointing is I on a daily basis take up robotic doctor here as robotic which contains like facilities had taken many other robotics and consistently I find that I have zero lactobacillus in mice tool in\nMany by patients a similar find it so what's going on with that does that mean to provide acts are not working they're not taking sort of like spreading seeds in the Sahara Desert it's an act of futility 'cause the soil is not conducive to their gross\nSo does that mean that they're useful the answer is no because probiotics may work in a different way in some people because there's something called bacterial crust talk bacteria in the intestinal tract\nInteract with our immune system a large part of it which resides in what are called the tires patches in our large intestine from these players patches\nAre actually receptors for information from the bacteria that populate our intestinal tracts are micro biome and if you have a healthy microbiomes you have healthy beneficial cross talk\nAnd if you have an unhealthy micro biome was bad bacteria and a lack of good bacteria your immune system gets the wrong signals\nAnd so based on this idea of cross talk it certainly is plausible it even if I had to buy the stone implant and grow in your intestinal tract they're doing something more over\n... may be responsible for the synthesis of beneficial compounds\nVitamins nutrients that are essential for the functioning of the immune system and for the bodily functioning

back\nSo we're calling a number of a woman business executives in the manufacturing field and we're going to start with Barbara act shoes CEO of dirt go manufacturing in my home town of Waterbury rate to start right uh in the neighborhood Barbara great to meet you things are joining us on the program\nWell John thank you for having me on today I really appreciate this opportunity\nSo tell us about ... what are you guys manufacture\nWell with the ... in Waterbury as bad and we made in his ... her scheduling components or only animal across multiple um market\nAnd run and tell me what is an e M\nA rich you know as you Eric manufacturers\nOkay and then\nJust apply to a diverse a bunch of clients\nHe had everything ... called aero space or ... or ... or even going\nInto so so what brought you to ... were you involved in this kind of work or at your entire career your entire life\nOh not at all not at all I'm ethnically wet and how I ... a part of dirt bell is my dad was a very have multiple there's an owner and\n... and I became a feeling it when my father wanted to buy another company and\nIn that at all\nAnd I became affiliated when my father wanted to buy another company and\nIn that acquisition and it was a a machinery acquisition\nOn then it turned to let's see what we can make with this unfortunate the uh several years after we started a believe like eight years after we started off the only thing that company and my dad was killed in a car\nAccident and that led to read at the helm ... and now or ten years later here we are growing\nUp three hundred percent um since his untimely death and a continuing and hoping to go more than the next five years\nReally sorry about your Deborah blew up into Bhutto's own\n... well how big is your workforce are you a big manufacturing mediums ... how many folks working Dirk ... factory\nWell DARPA has twelve employees that present and we are considered small ah we occupy us ten thousand square foot facility in Waterbury um where diversified um in our client greatest\nWe may make a lot of green parts as well so that was strategically are beginning on but now it only represents three percent of our market\nUm we are trying to diversify into larger markets we're exploring FDA approval uh to enhance the capabilities that we can confide to the manufacturing sector\n... with all\nDue respect sales drives it so that's what we focus on daily\nWill lead to switch gears and talk a little bit about the\nWomen in manufacturing and tap your expertise Barbara would advice would you give to a woman or whether it's a young student who's thinking about their future career or um or an adult to might be working to get into the workforce\nGoing to tell us a little bit about\nWhat you're hearing back from the front lines there of your workforce\nMhm they love they love it they enjoy being a part of the problem solving a nature of it\nThey love 'em you know interacting with with the products and and the process um you know I think I think that there's some natural instinct that women have to sort of\nA ... tons of questions and get under the hood and and really find out why things are the way that they are and and how they can improve so I you know I think whether you're a man or woman is it's just an exciting I'm industry to begin and now that there is a much more women than there used to be\nA in manufacturing industry it's just it's just become a really really um [noise] wonderful place to be\n... and and and as you're talking to your colleagues across the state ... especially those whose manufacturing companies like yours are part of a multigenerational situation where there probably were mostly if not all men working in a company up until relatively recently\nUm or or or do you share an attitude with a growing number of manufacturing leaders across Connecticut in terms of seeing a high value and are diversifying the workforce and uh\nUh not only welcoming but ... potentially targeting in recruiting more women to come and work for them\nUm yeah I think whether you're targeting a women or men I think it's important for manufacturers in the state to really think about how they're going to be engaging that the workforce that comes in\nUm I think in the past weave the way that we've trained as either you know shadowing\nUm some someone who went before you are\nOn the different mentor and you know some people aren't the most natural mentors I think mentoring it's great I think it's absolutely necessary but if people aren't natural mentor helping the mentors get training so that they can be effective trainers I'm to the to the young people coming in I think would be helpful and then engaging people in certain projects\nUm versus sort of just one area until that area's mastered no um that would be my suggestion\nProjects um versus sort of just one area until that area's mastered now that would be my suggestion\nFantastic well great advice and great to talk with you a Joe Joe Bryan mayor is president of the multi generation a bead industries with offices in Milford in Cheshire I thanks for joining us in helping us uh\nCelebrate manufacturing months here in Connecticut and are are getting ready to gear up for the thirtieth anniversary of the federal women's business ownership backed a great to meet you Joe\n[noise]\n\nAll right next we're going to head out to broaden to acme wire products their president is Mary Fitzgerald and she's on the line with us now Mary great to talk with you thanks for joining us this morning\nSure I I just want to mention the acme wire products is in Mystic Connecticut um so we're on the stoning to inside\n... mystic so a ... is still out there uh in kind of a pocket of of manufacturing or\nThe uh the military base the sub base out there and an electric boat or a that's kind of a\nAn area of the state where there's a lot of manufacturing isn't it\nA there there's a manufacturing pockets um but it's a little harder to find them then in some of the other areas of the state ... um the mystic area does a great job of promoting um\nThe wailing surgery and the poor and they don't realize all of the other hidden gems that they have here with the manufacturers in the area or an acme wire products is a manufacturer of\nCustom engineered stealing stainless steel wire and metal component parts ... ah we primarily focused on close tolerance applications\nSome examples of that would include handles levers axles than light and machine guards a shell grids baskets that you would be using for processing or material handling mostly in a factory ... uh supports furniture components\nAre we're a job shot manufacturers so we have none of our own products all the parts that we make our customers specification on customer owned tooling\nOkay well you bring up an important point them because I'm a I think a lot of people that might be listening to the program pick of manufacturing is just a you know going in or if necessary kind of suiting up but to keep the environment clean and\nDoes and building a or a a manufacturing of items with the machines but I'm a your company I it sounds like those a lot of interface and create this development was your clients\nA yes or we're not product designers but we assist a lot of designers and other manufacturers making the components that are more manufacture a ball you know I'm the one thing and the costs\nIt's one thing the dream an idea but it's another to get it out of the end of the manufacturing process and indecision and cost effective way right\nThat that's true [noise]\nSo do any of the products that are that you make their act we want our products or end up and consumers hands anything or\nOr any of our listeners might to put our hands on that um my dad was an anywhere product item in\nSome of the things that you might recognize our um we make baskets\nThat go in high end fishing and hunting coolers ... um we also make chair frames or some of them used in the bottom or the frames of school chairs ... um we make face masks for La Crosse helmets\nUm we do in the medical sterilization baskets an IV poles that you might see when you go into a medical clinic or a doctor's office or we make kitchen accessories a high end to think like trainers and down get\nLaw that's quite a diverse line how did you uh find your way into the company was manufacturing something that you decided on a ... during your school years that you've gotten into what's ah what's your buck story\nA while the company was started by my father Edward Cullen at it in Nineteen Seventy and um he would be bringing my sisters and brothers and I into work during the summers\nAre to do a lot of non machine oriented um fabrication ... we would be working either in the packing department the quality department doing some assemblies I'm as we got\nFabric Haitian ... be would be working either in the packing department the quality department doing some assemblies\nI'm as we got older and we would be filling in for vacationing employees in the office running or some of the computer programs um\nYou know doing a lot of the other non machine types of um manufacturing jobs ... and um [noise] I came when I when I graduated from college um I actually went to work for another\nWire fabricate her in the state of called durable wire in Branford\nI'm In the main reason that I got the job there is because they had the same computer system that asked me why or did and I knew how to operate the system from my summers working at acme wider ... okay I'm In a than a transition to that position into an inside sales in customer service role\nAnd um after a few years there I came back and started working at acme wire professionally\nI'm In sales and marketing and\nOkay ... well before we let you go marry or we'd like to hear some wise advice that you might have whether it's for um a young woman who might be eyeing\nA stem career of some sort of with an idea that manufacturing\nAnd staying here in Connecticut and working maybe even in their own home town of might ah might offer them in terms of an opportunity I'm told or or for a a woman who might be I'm just getting into a career as an adult or changing careers or to tell us what you would advise a\nYoung woman or a woman of any age in regards to uh considering manufacturing as an option\nWell there are many career opportunities in manufacturing companies some of them are technical in nature such as welding the and the programming machining a assembly or cost estimating and others are more administrative such as finance human resources even purchasing\nShipping and logistics um management and the production control so there are a lot of different opportunities and manufacturing for people with all different types of skills\nUm and you really need to keep yourself open to new opportunities don't be afraid to apply\nTo a job or to position the enemy any factoring company a because you may have a preconceived notion of you know while manufacturing I'm going to be working in the shop is going to be you know dirty or allowed or whatever a lot of modern manufacturing companies aren't that way\nAnd you may have to start your manufacturing career in one department but then we may be able to transition to another area after you've proven yourself or get a baseline of skills and and some skills can be transferable and valuable to different industries\nOf the thirtieth anniversary of the federal women's business owners are about\n... and so I guess ... bears discussing it for the moment or two that we have left or\nThe ... it's not all about working on the manufacturing for either a couple of our other guests of talked about are the diverse range of jobs that are available under the umbrella of manufacturing that don't actually involved putting your hands on product or machines\nThat's definitely true ah\nFor us systems and technology are very important we produce all of our products custom to order so we have sophisticated systems that allow us to\nAh create configurations and manufacture exactly what's needed so we have people that are involved in IT in logistics we actually have in the house marketing here\nAnd that's really important we sell our products through college bookstores all over the country and one of the things we do is we work with them and provide them with marketing tools and expertise so that they can be successful selling our products\nBecause we really find we have to do more than just shifted into the store and wait for it to sell\n'em and we also have a website diploma frame dot com and were able to manage and maintain that entire website here ourselves we do all of our design work and we also can add new products and manage the website so there are so many aspects finance\nCustomer service we have real people you answer the phone so there are lots of opportunities available in a manufacturing company like ours\nCustomer service we have real people really answer the phone so there are lots of opportunities available in a manufacturing company like ours\nAnd I imagine it feels great to be able to work and maybe not in your home town but at least in your home state and be able to provide a\nVery viable product successfully and be able to compete economically against ah the companies that might be making the similar kinds of products outside the U. S.\nThat's absolutely true I think that's one of the most rewarding parts for me is knowing that we're providing good quality jobs and we have also been able to take advantage of some state programs

Monroe and uh she is hoping a celebrated October as manufacturing ones here in Connecticut great to meet you Lucy and great to hear about your fantastic success and look forward to visiting with you again thanks\nThank you very much John ...\n\nAs we wrap up our special report celebrating the thirtieth anniversary\nOf the federal women's business ownership out here in October which is manufacturing month or so pleased to welcome our final guess Beverly daisy who's president of ... products in Bridgeport Beverly thanks for joining us on the program told us a little bit about yourself and the company a\nFirst or a little bit about your your product line and\nHow you came into this leadership position\nMy company is a a manufacturing facility in Bridgeport we have always been in Bridgeport and it was established in Nineteen fifty eight by my parents mhm uh Sylvia ... my dad was a printer and um it encountered all kinds of frustrations with printers banks\nAnd consequently he and a chemist friend developed a formula for staying removal a specific we sort of taking on skin\nAre and how to get a hands clean and such and over time the product has evolved now to become the exclusive leave formulated a stain remover product is so based it's not solving a solvent that will work on um fabrics and skin and surfaces for taking out not only inks\nBut all other kinds of things food food stains and blood in Greece and die and um all all the things that make us all crazy when we do things on our favorite shirt\nRan a so so we are in the business of making stain remover products or God oh and our our our our our our uh our our ...\nProbably proudest accomplishment with our product is that we are the only state removal a product that is recommended by newer brand to make sharp ... odd because they haven't actually actually take a short the\n... and your client base is global\nIt is yes yes well we sell a all over the world\nYou know when when you think about a new products or\nYour uh your family certainly is a has hit the mark but a a ... at what point did you uh it was always an assumption that you would um move\nInto this business in some capacity and eventually you you find yourself in a leadership role of a of a president\nAbsolutely not\nIt was actually the polar opposite I have two brothers and uh I think that my parents my father specifically must so my mother anticipated that if the company where to stand a bit in the family it likely would be taken over by one or both of my brothers\nAnd over time they went into different career directions and decided that this really didn't suit them uh I always had had an interest or had been in academia and um when the time came where my parents at a crossroads\nI stepped up and said no I Would like to take over the company and um my mother compelled him to think seriously about it and decided that yes they would pass it on to me and\nHere we go ... go so I took over in two thousand five ... and ah and then I have a four children they're two pairs of twins actually my and as they finish college and did their thing out there for a while they uh eventually come into the company and now all four of them work with me wow\nThey finished college and did their thing out there for a while they a bench we've come into the company and now all four of them work with me wow that's wonderful\nOh it's terrific yes and one's an engineer so he was perfectly suited to take over all of the plant operations in formulation and uh so I said I have this tailor made a employee base here which is really interesting so we are your quintessential family business\nTesting so ... is so are we as we spoke a few moments before uh we turned on the microphone I'm an important thing that we haven't really talked a lot about was our other guests over the course of the report has been the ... the\nValuable element of apprenticeship of all let's talk about that\nWhen you're speaking directly to a woman that might be listening and thinking about\nWhat am I going to do or where can I go or I'm hearing that there's a lot going on in manufacturing and maybe that's an area either as a student I should focus on as a future career or as an adult or someone\nEntering the workforce for the first time we're transitioning uh in the workforce\nOr that a ... and maybe apprenticeship a is a a going to be a valued element of\nOf that advancement\n[noise] yeah well what I um when I think is very much a a misconception these days is the perception that out there in the workforce manufacturing is a very a boring repetitive type of uh of work day\nAnd actually it's I Believe the opposite I'm world the world and manufacturing has evolved to something extraordinarily dynamic\nAnd who am I speaking to the women out there I speak both to people who are looking at career change\nAnd also to um people guiding their their daughters and will in options for their future and and things to consider and recently a thought about a year or two ago a manufacturing innovation fund which is a a a ... state sponsored fund\nAnd a and I sit on that board um we established an apprenticeship program whereby people can basically get on the job training be compensated for that training get exposed to different op opportunities out there in the workplace and manufacturing\nAnd I think it's an ideal setting to determine whether your skill sets in interests are suited to those um employment opportunities that are out there\nOnce you get into a a into that arena\nWhen I think people probably don't realize is that in your factoring so dynamic\nYou may find one thing you're doing at one time\nTo you outgrow it or you want to move on to something else or there's something\nA another dimension in that operation that that more that is of greater interest to you and it's very easy to move out and move on to something else within a company or companies operation because uh the manufacturing world has so many layers\nIt's not just production it's not it's not just supply chain it's not just a ... a marketing it's all of that together and successful\nThat request for

you have some sort of root system growing\nYou're putting fertilizer in there to to help that [noise] and it might actually help the roost system long term in there\nOne of the other things uh like to see you do in my father had talked about this prior uh and it was something that I I was I've looked into myself\nIs when you clean out the garden or leave the plant\nIn their cut this cut the the tomatoes that cucumbers whatever all the way back to the ground leave about an inch would leave that root system intact until spring until you go to replant rise what it's doing is at root system is is is working and doing everything all winter and continuing that\nUm that flow especially if you have um\nThe Mike arising fun guy that is in there so you use like on a plant starter in ... ad in the soil are consistently instead of a start stop to what this\nIs the U.S before about something like winter wheat or something and I thought about doing something like that\nYou could do that but the other thing you know what I'm thinking this by putting these bombs in the ground they do have that dorm and see period but I think it's going to help by having some sort of root system in their\nEarly ... when you do your guard and later on I think you can only be beneficial for you okay I'm going to try thank you very much Jim thank you so much for the phone call thank you and good luck with the with the garden [noise]\nThank you thank you [noise]\nThe phone number here eight five five six six zero four to six once again eight five five six six zero four to six one\nBeer till seven o'clock eastern time to answer all your gardening questions so real meaning of calling their everything we can to help me out to be careful\nHow would you like the guy to be green this year yes that's possible with virus they products aren't safe as an organic wheat and graphs killer roundup\nWell my question as to why she didn't want\nIt to our yard we have a big\nThe question of well my question is I Do question why is it in the yard we have a big a big uh\nGrad is like very odd and we have five or six years and they've always done really well this year they still well one ended up uh\nDoing better towards the end of the summer and the other one uh it had some rat but not a lot and I'm Wondering whether the symptom of just the weather or if there's anything that we do here\nI figured out a little bit to do with the weather or we you know\nEven on Cape Cod you guys had a little bit of a crazy winter like we did a in the northern part of the state where it's really snowed in February versus any time in a December January we also had that warm up in February so really do some damage to plants\n[noise] um do you usually a cut the grass is back\nAh every fall or do you let them go\nLet them go at them in the spring\nOkay I mean and they either way works there is no wrong way on that if you wanted to uh cut them in the spring perfect I just wanted to see if that had something to do with it\nOr this year um so I go ahead\n[noise] I don't know it was a just really weird and then there were a few others on our street that we're a similar issue\nOkay and are they close to the road or the closer to the house\nTo the out\nOkay well you know it it really does sound like it could be a weather things\nOr maybe you know just the way the weather was we did have that really warm temperatures in February and then it got to freezing cold one of the other things that happened was we had that warm temperatures than we had a nor'easter that was actually rain versus snow the first one\nSo plant starting to see the warm up and then what they from there the plants felt the rain and they kind of thought okay maybe it's starting to get into April they started to warm up and and start to you to wake up if you will\nAnd then from there we had those nor'easter is that we're snow or down the Cape you might have a little bit more rain on a few of them but it got plans thinking and got them warmed up and ready to go [noise] and then we had the snow and that could be one of the things that actually really hurt the plants\n[noise] okay then my other question is about rose to erode the other part of the yard or one of them is actually a child that very bright yellow yep a racket Matt now that we do to prepare them a ... [noise]\nOkay so\nI wouldn't be doing any huge ah pruning at this time you can cut some of it back if you wanted to but your biggest pruning should be in around April twentieth April fifteenth [noise]\nUm [noise] my father would always say that uh it would be around the time that the red Sox came back to Boston in the spring and started playing for real instead of like spring training games once they start to come back that's about the time you could start to premier roses [noise]\nAt this point in time\nOnce you can actually do is and I wait a little bit because what I'm about to tell you the with the ... using of salt marsh hey are mulch\nCutting that around the plant can ... can create like a um a most hotel if you will by putting it too early mice and small are rodents are looking for shelter for the winter the looking for water et cetera [noise]\nWhat I Would want you to do maybe closer to Thanksgiving [noise] taste either get salt marsh hey for some malls and going about twelve inches up on the rows and cover it all the way around it [laughter] for winter that's going to help protect the base of the plant and keep it that\nConsistent temperature versus a the free saw facts that could be happening [noise]\nLike I said again you'd want to do that closer to Thanksgiving and you can like you can either use salt marsh hay or you can use mulch\nGreat thank you so much\nChris thank you for the phone call and good luck with the uh what's your plants\nThank you Bye bye bye by\nThe phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six once again eight

welcome to the ballpark garden club how can we help you\nThank you [laughter] I have a question about doing okay doing ... ... you need to have you definitely going\nAnd\nIt didn't seem to catch up and now we got about three feet on the ... just got a black and it's kind of either estimate that he\nIs or what I Would do is I Would cut the blossoms off 'em right below the stem maybe go to a junction where you would see some leaves and just get rid of the blossoms from it one of the things ... and got\nThe whole thing I Would in at this point uh depends on when you can cut them on what style of hide ranging you have\nA gym and have it and they'll have already know they're paying okay they started off in the yeah yeah okay so the most likely they're and they're in a full sun probably\nMhm All right so it's a a\nA ... a lot of the ... will grow a new growth and on old on\nOld wood or was this one would have liked to see you do is cut the flowers back\nLeaving a plant the way it is by leaving the flowers on there when it snows or when it gets really heavy rain that type of thing that can weigh the plant down and and break the inside um give it fresh it would it would cut the the main stem that type of thing\nFrom there and what you can actually do is to buy the high drained you up almost like a Hershey kisses\nUh-huh the bottom is you know is is more around and the top is a really tight you use like a ... it's like a green wine that I'm as biodegradable\nSee I'm tied up there like I said like a Hershey's kiss\nAnd then in the next couple of weeks maybe closer to Thanksgiving I'd want to see you put a either salt marsh have or some ... close to the plant itself salt marsh have probably your best bet there's no weed seeds it can breathe and grow through there if you weren't going to get it\nOr early in the ... you know remove it early in the spring\nWhich you could also what I'd also like to see you do is spray\nThe plant was will proof

ballpark garden club how can we help you mining the morning\nI had a red maple it probably five or six years old but you know the guy that started a little tiny thing maybe three or four into that confront\nAnd it bart first of all losing it believes already with\nIn early in it was even a losing leaves over the summer a little bit it bart is falling off first ... blood and then at all or been in the ... and\nNow we're about to visit a falling off how far up the plant\nUp as far as the bird by all of a limb coming out of that probably I don't know maybe three or four feet out\nOkay or when you go in there is it really soft as the woods soft\nOh I didn't look no no my husband and now it's not\nOkay so it's just the bark this feeling off it's not the inside of the tree itself\nA lie don't think it's been bad but it sounded a egg scarier bark\nAnd as a God and I don't know if that is looming from down the very bad and um where the uh try to make the ground at the bottom\nOut three or four inches is coming out in a more bold that way as though it bore me new bar over the decaying by\nThat I don't I don't think that has um is hurting its there what I'd be concerned about where the bark is coming off as where being open to the inside of the plant in insects getting into it or or diseases you said you noticed leaves falling I'm In like August and early this year\nOr in August uh yeah ... ... ... ... ... it seemed to me ... or\nEarlier than usual went into a bright red low yeah\nSo it could be a ... a sign of stress for the tree I'm you know dropping this leaves right now I'm I'm not completely surprised on it just based on some of the phrases that we've had lately uh the oh Thursday we had in the ... high twenties it shocked some trees\nAnd then we had some rain the past um\n[noise] we had some cold weather\nI Believe again friday night and I I noticed in my yard a lot of maple leaves were just falling everywhere to some not surprised with that part that the one the thing that gets me is when it's dropping leaves in like August I'm In early September now have you fertilize this tree at all\nYet we tried to fertilize that and we tried to play it for about ...\nOkay now um when did you fertilize it lasted recently\nUm maybe a month ago\nOkay perfect so what I'm going to want you to do in the future is in the spring fertilizes again use a tree tone a product from ... and use it it's what you want to do is you want to go where the drip line of the tree is so however far out the leaves the branches though that's considered the drip line\nAnd put it into the soil around it I usually make about four holes it's like the end of the shovel opening up a little bit and then place about a quarter of the um recommended amount in each of those holes and then water everything in\nThe other thing I'd like to see you do is um maybe you could take a picture of that park where it's it's it's appealing\nAnd maybe take a look at it and maybe send it to us on the from our website at ... dot com oh okay I'm all the way down at the bottom of his contact us maybe some that picture to us and we'll take a look at it might take a couple of days for us to take a look\nAt and do what we can to answer you um but that might give me some some more information on it\nLook at it might take a couple of days for us to take a look at and do it we can to answer you um but that might give me some some more information on it\n[noise] but I was I I definitely think you know it if you're fertilizing that type of thing what would work for it I don't want you to use any type of pruning sealer they felt like a sealer out there that covers up where damage is happening I don't want to see that being use\nA because if there's something in there it keeps them in there\nIt doesn't allow like an insect out it just seals the whole area that's one of the reasons why I Would want to see the picture as well okay\nSo if you can do that that would be really helpful and I can get you some more information to help you figure out what's going on with your maple tree them at a really good if they can see thank you for the phone call enjoy the rest of your ah did\nThey do that by\nPhone number here is a five five six six zero four to six one again eight five five or six six zero four to six one for the call and try to answer all your gardening questions\nOr a beautiful morning garden that's healthy as they used dramatic liquid plant foods by tram the organic choice to produce grill fruits and vegetables that are healthy for your family\nGet more on what is the best way to go into how to knock out\nA knockout roses I mean the best way to really do is make sure there are you have them in the ground right now that pot it\nOh I'm Sorry I thought you said powdered I'm ... I'm just trying to I was wondering here does it have powdery mildew okay so potted rows of sorry I'm so the potted rose the best way to do it as maybe keep it underneath a porch or keep it up against the side of a house\nOr it's going to get some sort of protection\nAnd then for the winter cover around it with either mulch or salt marsh hay\nAnd usually do that around Thanksgiving with that but those are what the covering like mulch or or salt marsh hey that way you're not inviting you know a rodents or insects that type of thing to live into that area but if you ...\nNo I understand okay so if you take the pot and put it up against the house or underneath a I'm a porch and then put the the salt marsh hair around it\nSo that it protects the pot and keeps the temperature consistent\nSo instead of the the pot being above ground at the root systems above the ground so when the ground free when outside is freezing the roots are going to freeze 'em\nEasier than if they had something around that to protect it so that's why I Want you to put the salt marsh hair the mouse around the pot for the winter\nSo that it can ease some of that stress in there obviously some of the cold is going to get to the roots and make them go dormant but by doing this has really helping protected so it will over winter the right way for you for next year\nI have a um a front row seat it would that be a good\nPlace for them it whether they were [noise]\nWell so they a lot of the shrubs that we have a New England uh do need that doormen see period a so bringing them in it might affect them long term a ... you might have some you know decent size Bush's growing longer\nOr but over time you're going to have something along that you might not be able to bring in and so the plants going to get used to having those warm temperatures throughout the season it really does want a dormant period and that's why I Would suggest you know up against the side of the house I'm ...\nI'm Sorry I don't know what a garage\nYou could put it in the garage but it's going to need some of the sons oh okay 'cause it still needs to get the sun during the winter um\nAs a window\nOkay this is that you know is it what kind of a light to going to get do you think it would get you know half day quarter of the day\nOn the line I mean the window you know hey in tonight\nYou know it it could be fined and she had like that or to allow it to go dormant and keep the temperatures consistent\nWater at all\nI Know you you kind of you will water it until the ground freezes outside so once the ground is frozen that's when he would slow down on the stop on the watering you wanted to just go dormant for the winter\nPutting it in there in front window in the shed\nRound is frozen that's when you would slow down on the stop on the watering he wanted to just go dormant for the winter\nBut putting it in there in front window in the shed\nThat's fine it would be like it was outside except the temperatures were just cold\nRight okay that's that's what we're looking for\nOkay and uh I have a TGI danger\nBut I caught the blossoms off now wait till\nI'd cut the blossoms off now just to help protect it for winter the big blossoms on there if it gets snow on it gets heavy rain it can bend the plant over him maybe rip it off of the the stem versus having a nice fresh caught 'em you have just the the Bush former do you have the tree form\nThe tree farm [noise] yeah I'd I'd cut some of the bigger ones off you can always cut them now and drive them and use them and arrangements during the winter or you can just you know get rid of them are cutting some of those blossoms back in just a blossom itself don't do a heavy prune on it\nBut I just got in the early ... just cutting the flowers backs can help it so it's not going to put so much weight on it over the winter you know having snow sitting on top of it can just really flat in the tree out and and really affect it\nOkay I'm not quite sure I'm a I'm a I'm a vaccine carry it they do oh okay so I if I put them in the shed near the window and um how about water\nNo water over the winter you want it to just be natural\nOkay we'll just put them in the shed and um let me at the window\nYeah I mean the perfect situation would be to uh put it to keep it outside so if you get all the elements that would have just covered around the pot itself\nOr by putting it in the shed allow it to go dormant that way have some of the light we don't want it to be in a dark period because of the dark beard can really affected and not making survive a that's why you know you want to have some light in it\nSo that it will I'm outside or leave it outside and and put a um hey around it\nThat's that's what I Would do I would have to put it up against you can put up against the house under a deck may be close to the woods where it's going to it's a wind isn't going to hit it as heavily\nThat type of thing I'm just looking to give it some extra protection and that's why I say next to a house or under a porch um you know where it's going to get some of that sunlight and get the elements as well\nOkay thank you\nAre at you and thank you for the phone

York where he feels very comfortable center\n... year he's got one of the most intriguing books out in quite some time even though his knee deep in politics and policy and he knows the the amount of emotion out there he's looking at the big picture he's written a new book called them why we hate each other and how to heal senator welcome Thanks Brian good either but I also like the ... you also um\nYou're the book did extremely well too because you thought about the big ... picture you thought about culture what each other\nI think it's because we don't have the natural tribes that were used to as the place that you find happiness we have a collapsing nuclear family structure we have fewer deep friends than we've ever had in statistics on this stuff we have declining local worshipping communities and we have shorter duration jobs so political tribalism is ramping up\nNot because it politics politics matters but it doesn't matter all that much it's not the center of life but politics is trying to fill a void as people's neighborhoods that are collapsing and we should be attending to the first things first which is not politics\nOr bombing a bomb in the house uh watching uh watching on um my Apple TV and then I pick up my iPhone on taxing a bunch of people and interacting with people that don't exist yet that I don't see you said that the stats one from average\nAmount of Americans with friends had three French three point something it's down to like one point something now do you have is because of technology it's a huge\nPart of it so I'll thank you for reading the book by the way a we have half as many friends in America today as we did twenty five years ago the average American Dream to have friends in Nineteen Ninety today at one point eight as you say\nAnd so the smartphone is great lots of wonderful economic things come from her smartphone but make sure you turn the dang thing off tonight and have dinner with your kids because it turns out that matter so much more than your smart phone if you go from two hundred five hundred social media friends you're not happy are statistically if you know the neighbor two doors down you're happier\nBut you're just saying the right now with America's for the most part a looming\nVery lonely you talked to researchers at the national institutes of health they think that loneliness as the number one public health crisis in America it drives most of obesity for instance being lonely for a day is the equivalent of smoking Fifteen cigarettes I Want people to read them because I Want them to be healthy or not just physically but in their neighborhood\nBut we can't do or you know it's very frustrating to hear well the nuclear family has gone away and we hear a lot of the minority communities that's part of the problem we I Do about that makes me want to throw my hands and say what am I supposed to do about everybody else making decisions not to have nuclear family yes so the first thing you should do is invite people over in your neighborhood you got lots of listeners who are blessed to have a stable nuclear\nFamily there are a bunch of kids who don't know their dad two blocks from you invite 'em over for dinner hosted a coach little league ...\nTo have a stable nuclear family there are a bunch of kids who don't know their dad two blocks from you invite them over for dinner hosted a coach little league joined the Rotary Club joined co want us all that stuff is more important than who you're angry at in politics again politics matters\nBut it's way downstream from the stuff that really matters which is probably within five minutes of your house to is that very interesting\nThing we could all do but here you are a knee deep in Washington the big policies the emotion ... Lindsey Graham says that was being spit on two weeks ago being spit on by people I've never met before Senator Jeff flake is being accosted in elevators by women he's ever seen before so how does someone look at that and think ... book really spells out how this happened\nYes so I've had those experiences to ... I mean\nI think everybody around like life gets death threats now I my kids I have three kids aging from a ranging from age seven to Seventeen we host water stations at local marathons and people come up and and screamed that when the water when I handed to a twenty year old woman running buying the marathon they'll scream don't drink at it's poised and he wants to kill you\nThey think they're doing that because we differ about legislative issues there's something much deeper wrong in their life if they're willing to scream that I'm trying to poison somebody when I'm volunteering at a water station\nThe only way you can make that stuff's better is in the neighborhood where you live that can't be made better by legislation in Washington you can't pass a bill that mandates people become friends but your listeners need to become better at being friends in a world where the smartphone is telling us we don't have to live where we are\nSo if you have an example of Washington I'm working across the ILO with a buddy let's say shoe movies more likeable and he felt like you could work with him I'm so Jeff Flake said this on sixty minutes and then I think it applies here\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could ... who have done this if you were running out of ... and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp too partisan and ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that's the problem that's the identity but is that the reason you shouldn't I mean if if the bench that saw somebody of like minded could cut a deal with on the other side are you concerned about you a political future if you do it\nNo I don't care about that stuff I Want to eight people out of a hundred in the Senate has never been a politician before and when my wife and I decided to run a we said for four and a half of the next six years will act like we're never run for reelection so we're due to\nPray about it and not all and I've talked to some wise counselors in July and August next year and make decisions about our future but I don't worry about political incumbency has a core motivator for me um but the problem is Washington DC is filled with political addicts those are not normal people people who want to go to Washington DC instead of their whole life they\nAren't good representatives of the people listening to your show we need term limits we need people who want to be from a you know all the community of Syracuse a New York and in Fremont, Nebraska and want to go back to those places because that's the place where you love those are the communities that really matter but\nSays that this is also the fact that we'd safe spaces at colleges or the fact that dates and therapists to dorms after the election does that play into why you wrote this book\nYeah that that's a mess we do to touch on the same space movement in this book I was a college president before I ran for Senate\nAnd one of the reasons moms and dads should be writing checks to send your kids to college is so that you encounter ideas you didn't already know if you want to go to a college where you have never have to encounter any idea you didn't already know I don't know why you'd spend any money that's called education I don't want my kids to be safe from New ideas I Want him to\nEncounter new ideas but I Want to do it in that context of human relationship where after you argue about philosophy or politics or whatever you didn't want to go get a drink with somebody and have dinner with them because they're actually\nStill humans created an image of God\nSo when you decide for example I think you might be a good example use told me something I did not know you've been critical of the president not at his policies but a lot of it is is a is a is demeanor a lot of the way approaches do things but you do still talk to the president\nOh I Do I I like talking to the president and I'm grateful that he's willing to to take my call so we wrestle through issues I think he's done a great job on a bunch of cyber issues for instance and\nI've been present on that and I wanted to take a tiny bit issue but I it demeanor obviously there's a ton of stuff the president does which is new that a lot of people are just having to wrestle through and make sense of my my their issues where I agree with the president on policy their issues where I disagree and he's grateful I'm grateful that he's willing to\nTo wrestle with me and have a conversation when I'm really worried about though is not this president or the election and twenty twenty I'm worried about what kind of country we live our kids and ten and Twenty years\nAnd we need to be having long term conversations about what America's about why we have limited government why we should do entitlement reform and the kind of stuff we talked about in them which is America believes in limited government because the center of the world is your community not D.C\nSays enter you live in a state that likes to then there's like Fox it what are the so called fly over states if people are ignoring before Fox came along I Would argue that Los Angeles DC and New York or just would program every single\nSo called flyover states if people are ignoring before Fox came along I Would argue that Los Angeles DC and New York uh just would program every single sitcom and every news broadcasts we didn't try to do that or an audience came different what do you know in Nebraska that New York DC and California doesn't\nUh that even though we're all insects right now the Oscars are still the football team in the last fifty years in every state are you a better get ready for the but the best of luck fifty years I granted we're really good from fifty until about Seventeen years ago ... will be back yeah go dropped off a lead us back to the problem is that right but football side\nDo you guys are you guys are not caught up in Nebraska you're not in the play by play you're not into the palace intrigue\nNo I think the vast majority of Nebraska and know that the really important things that happen in the world are what kind of character your kids going to have two months and two years from now right it's about whether or not the people in their neighborhood want to go to the same neighborhood gym\nNext Saturday Night and share on the same team even if we differ about politics politics can't be the center of your life they can't fill the vacuum of the worry we all have in our soul who's going to comfort us on our best bet that is going to be family and friends and coworkers is not going to be some politician off in Washington yeah I Do agree with\nAnd he said he's pushing his generals to fight to the men who didn't want to put a cold in the back of a frog nudity had to push generals to have one American shoot another American is that part of leadership doing making the tough decision that may rank who your rank who your instincts\nWithout a question he once said how strange it is that he who had hated violence in even never even want it to kill a turkey when he was young would find himself in the middle of the bloodiest war in time\nAnd yes you have to be both merciless and merciful you have to be both patients and persevere and\nAnd he was both things at the same time he encountered that side of the great place where the apathy comes out is once he is winning the war once the union is coming to an end with the war he gives the second inaugural and talks about reconciling with the south but until that moment of triumph he was willing to expend every bit of bloody hot to in order to get the war one and get slavery ended at\nIt's amazing to or if you think about uh the ... do you think humility has something to do with great leadership some say you choose weakness to say I don't know what somebody else whose ideas come out and not be yours that could show vulnerability where does humility and vulnerability commit\nSome way some for some reason in today's world it seems vulnerable to admit weaknesses in the earlier days certainly for Abraham Lincoln money runs for office the first time it's a wonderful statement he makes every man has its peculiar ambition mine is to be as teamed up by my fellow man\nBut I'm not sure up you'll understand me and I'm not sure if he'll vote for me\nAnd if I Do lose I won't be too chagrin because I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated and then I won't try again I promise\nBut he's setting that opening statement if I don't know something I'm going to learn it if I say something wrong I'm going to correct it right from the start he comes out of the gate with those qualities of resilience humility and empathy and they stay with them the rest of his life\nSo tell me if this was a leap did you could take lunch or notice book on grand talks about how grant slaves after the emancipation was issued more and more slaves were designed to run for freedom\nAnd when they were running to grant grants idea to say let's give these guys some uniforms and let them fight and he sees how they thought they got together and the galvanizing came into a unit and that's when we can start getting an idea of how with the world with this country is going to look like when this war is over\nNow I think that's right once the black soldiers became part of the union army as they did when he finally opened the door to the black soldiers they fought magnificently and even the generals who have been against the idea of bringing them into the army began to see that they're helping the cause and they're doing an amazing job\nBut Lincoln was reluctant at first to do it I mean he waited and waited until Nineteen sixty three because he feared that the whites in the army weren't ready for it he fit the north even the north wasn't ready timing is everything he said so we watch the changing sentiment he watched what was beginning to happen\nAnd that's another quality of a leader you can't do what you may want to do unless the timing is right the timing was perfect for the Emancipation Proclamation and for allowing blacks in the army\nEven though it was driving Frederick Douglass not that he was waiting so long right exactly\nBut Frederick Douglass said once Lincoln takes a stand on something he'll never go back he maybe slow getting there but it's true I mean when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation there was a lot of blow back in the north north and license legislatures passed\nRules sang or a statements saying we're not for this we didn't fight for this where just for the union and some of them were threatening to secede from New England and yet Lincoln knew that the timing would be okay that they would come around and they finally did and then Douglas finally accepted yes you are right on timing\nA Doris Kearns Goodwin here so if there was a natural leader even though we started off grew up sickly and he was somebody had to be home schooled it had to be Teddy Roosevelt it seems he built up his body because he couldn't early\nEven though we started off grew up sickly and he was somebody had to be home schooled it had to be Teddy Roosevelt it seems he built up his body because you couldn't early he did later became physical weight because he couldn't early right\nNow you know what's so interesting about that is that he made himself a strong person and that became an example are for the rest of his life he said one time there are two\nKinds of success in the world summit when somebody has a talent and nobody else can develop no matter how hard they try like keep for a

person but he was a great bird or he wasn't that\nGood of a shot but it became a world class hunter um he wasn't a good boxing but he somehow last to die at one point but he became a good boxer everything came to hardworking made him south Philly was boxing in the basement by the White House ... unless wrestling matches boxing the his favorite thing was taking people on these hikes in wooded\nAreas of Rock Creek park where he made a rule that you couldn't go around any obstacle you had to go up Iraq if you've got to go down people were falling by the wayside if they're trying to find him in the woods two hours he would exercise every day it's one of the things I think about my leaders which is\nThat they able to figure out how to find time to think and relax and replenish their energies we think we don't have time and not twenty four seven while they had pretty important things to do the civil war World War two and they did and they surely did\nWrite a doors or when you talk about the Roosevelt he took on the monopoly he felt like the day uh too much power and they did maybe perhaps it would control too much of the economy and if you want to take on the uh the big guys the bullies maybe it helps that you were a hundred and ten pounds suffering from asthma your whole use and maybe would picked on yourself\nAnd maybe you don't lose that ability to try to avenge it\nYou know that's really interesting I'm not sure I fully thought about that but I think you're right I mean he was bullied as a child\nAnd he felt that some of the big companies were bowling smaller companies and getting them out of business and he was going to defend the people who needed to help the people who win the independent companies and and wanted to have their own life and their own sense of accomplishment and they were being taken by the big hand these monopoly is I think you're right and thought about that well I Want to\nTalk about the power plays of FDR in LBJ or do we
