Jackson every by the way every ticket you get the paperback version with the brand new afterward\nAnd in Nashville tendency on the twentieth ... on the on the twenty first that'll be seven thirty\nI'll be able to talk about oh three books America great from the start is what we call it and therefore I took about three books how we got to the point where all these books were written George Washington secret six Thomas Jefferson the Tripoli pirates in Andrew Jackson miracle New Orleans you also find out or what is in the works and has been to the last year\nShe'll be done in about seven months or the other project to a gym exchange excited about so there's more than that\nOver a right after those three events the book comes out on the twenty third and on friday I Will be in St Louis hope we get everybody here from Ninety seven one listeners\nRepublicans have systematically suppress voters Mm probably as many or naval does twelve million voters were purged by Republicans governments and state between twenty twelve and twenty sixteen\nSo we know that Democrats have to turn out an even bigger numbers and a lot of congressional district and said to be successful because they're\nBeing you know push back by a headwind that is trying to prevent them or discourage them from voting\nAnd we wish you get that for well I don't know all of the statistics and people that are on the right would be able to argue that\nPoint by point number by number with her or go through each state and explain why actions were taken too I mean take dumped on people who were double registered off the rules are people who had passed away off the rolls things like that\nUm she's speaking to something that the left truly believe I'm voter suppression as I call it is something that they think is happening as it is not even a conspiracy theory for them and it's just the fact that Republicans are are trying to suppress people from voting\nRepublicans would say no we want more people to vote but we want people to register to vote and to do so legally and therefore that's why they're trying to like for example Nikki Haley in South Carolina when she was governor said\nA voter id actually will encourage more people to vote it will get more people into the system um anyway what Hillary Hussein is a talking point that they use that it might sound a little crazy to conservatives but Brian they truly believe that that's a good topic actually for\nMe to do a Tucker next week they for that yeah it does do I don't mind you starting their conversation me going I was talking to Brian on the radio with that and he'll need on the radio yeah as we used my wife and I don't want them to use them as like someone other Brian right like I don't know who else would I possibly be a pretty much don't even\nNeed a good idea actually because the electoral college one is want something that people talk about but they don't have a lot of they don't have a lot of the statistics behind him on the history behind them so that's what I tried to do with that and voter suppression in the issue of it I'll do that next week\nSo there's a big story out today people making a big deal of Eric Holder saying what he said on top of what Hillary Clinton said there's no time for civility basically as long as we keep losing elections until we get the house or the Senate so do you have a problem with this\nDude it's time for us because Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are going to be dedicated to arms have used the ministers who says you know when they go low you know they go low we can [noise]\nThat was his new democratic warnings about\nThe president on Fox and friends to this\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're discussing said but for him to marry for him to make is that I've been to like that is a very dangerous state but you know they talk about us we are\nExactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I urge somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies that my rallies or really calm and and well run and and packed\nWith people we don't have problems that arose and I would say is that it wasn't so successful for those protesters but that to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous for an older so\n[noise] so I play that for Chris Wallace and he says I'm totally blowing out of proportion that it is not a big deal with Eric Holder said Dana Perino way and you could usually\nObserver I I'm an and looking at it so regardless of what I think Michelle Obama didn't like it right he was using\nYou don't deserve or I I I'm an and looking at it so regardless of what I think Michelle Obama didn't like it right he was using her language and she said no no no that's not that is that what I meant that's not that's not what I'm born she's trying to be the leader that she wants to be and that she would like to have for the country\nI oh I didn't know that Michelle Obama weighed in on whatever yeah and I only saw it on Twitter so I didn't say a lot but she was basically like oh no\nThat's not that's not where I Am I'm however I also think that there is a way you can blow things out of proportion for example when all of the rallies Trump starts to chant lock her up or or somebody starts at lock her up and and not that the president does it but\nAnd it's it's a a laugh line if you look at what Eric Holder's doing he was trying to rally up a crowd small crowd and a little room\nBut they all laughed and so I can I I don't want to blow anything out of proportion\nI Am concerned do more about the deeds right because Brian you know personally like it's not that much of people say oh go harass people and say nothing happens no but they're actually harassing people so for me when it turned goes from words ... that's a huge\nHuge concern so everybody's talking about\nA ... position which has got a new procedure because of prison United States or put them on the nurses ... council and that's his open chair now ... at the un and a lot of people have their candidates who I mean we've heard\nOur Ryan Zinke he was in there for for an interview uh people are brought up senator Ayotte I've thought Joe Lieberman might be fined for this but also the leading candidate is thought to be Dina Powell oh aren't you you would deal with talk recalls ...\nPowell seems like a nice person lots of people like her is she the right person for the job that's the question what she's worked on behalf\nOf virtually every idea that President Trump ran against in his two thousand sixteen campaign trumping remembers that it was time for America to act on his own behalf for once internationally and to avoid the pointless and counter productive wars ... views they are not\nBefore joining the Trump Administration she was a partner at Goldman Sachs was president of the Goldman Sachs foundation that's the nonprofit arm of investment back\nWhile they're short extensively with another ... famous foundation the Clinton Foundation and they work together on various goals that most from voters would find Republican\nShow me your thoughts on this well so um I I get I'm agnostic as who does who the president supports um I hadn't heard that Joe Lieberman one that's interesting but I think the president is going to want some of that he knows and trust that's really important to him\nSo the Ryan Zinke he uh take would make sense to me Dina pal worked for him and\nI think that ... that he just had something wrong here like she didn't work for the Clinton Foundation and actually the\nProgram that she worked on she created what's called ten thousand women and it was a way to help young women entrepreneurs from around the world to figure out a way to become entrepreneur self sufficient they did not use a dime of government money I'm pretty sure President Trump would like that\nThere was no government money but Dina Powell at the national Security Council actually wrote\nPresident Trump's national security strategy when that document came out it was widely praised\nBy most except for on the far left and one of the things that she focused on most is\nOr what the president is concerned about and because I watched Tucker I Know he's concerned about the number one enemy the United states identified as China and not the middle east um she was in Russia and she was really strong about pulling out of the Iran deal right supported the president on that so I think that um criticism about her on those things\nAre probably a probably on his ... way back when when I first met her she worked for Newt Gingrich well uh\nI Do get two people write me big saying that she would be the best person for that job so and I don't think it's it's a it's it's I I don't think it's a small back to the Nikki ... woman and I think that he could have more women and more minorities is\nCan he knows her and she's worked for him on foreign policy and so he could trust her right now I think that that's really important I don't think that he could\nGo with like a as an outsider like a Joe Lieberman because or even Kelly Ayotte who I think you know because of the Gorsuch shepherding during the Supreme Court nomination but doesn't know her as well as he would know Edina palate used to brief him every day\nWell and by the way Kelly Ayotte at first after the Access Hollywood tape came out she says I Would not want him as a role model yeah I Know we got over the Nikki Haley snob but maybe that might be an issue I Hope it's not me more about your issue about Mrs Obama coming out you're a hundred percent right the Daily Caller rights you know take the calls from their\nMoves Obama said she stands by her motto and things holders alternative is not a proper message for children absolutely here's a quote beer is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised\nI Want them to think about life in their opportunities do you want them to be a breed of their neighbors do you want them angry do you want them vengeful which model do you want them to live by and I have to think about that\nAs a mother wow yeah that's ...\nAngry do you want them vengeful which motto do you want them to live by and I have to think about that as a mother wow\nYeah that's pretty that's a really strong pitch that's better that's a better word a ever ever ever view of the comments but the thing is Brian\nAnd the Democrats are just they're so frustrated because they can't find a message that's working they're always on defense and the base the progressive base things that they're not fighting enough they think they should be more cynical meaner and it's not a great way to win elections even though they might be able to win back the\nHouse I don't think it sets them up while the wind back the Senate\nAnd I think they're in a real deficit going into twenty twenty\nSo a Bob Corker who's Tucson and I never remember he's always been pretty candid especially now that he's leaving he came out and said that he was offered a few weeks ago a opportunity joined the Trump Administration I Want to share the soundbite with the ... would you ever except the Trump Administration\n[noise] you know who knows um uh you know they they discuss something with me three or four months ago and [noise] and ah it was a it was a you know certainly an honor um it wasn't a particularly tough assignment and you know as you know I mean yes of to me\nThis is all about public service if the white\nTough assignment came up where you felt like you were making a difference or certainly I Would never say never\nIn three years we'll have a

the other foot if Republicans said that\nWhat would the reaction being how much coverage where they get he went on to say let's say listen I'm not saying do anything inappropriate he followed up with it because it clearly when you say something like that you know it's going to be incendiary the question I have\nIs how do we get to the other side of these issues which you over so many different issues all the time and I don't see that these leaders are ... and and it could be true as well for for conservative leaders and Republican leaders about but you know we had the same kind of conversations about civility but no one gets the other side of them you know we don't end advance them in any way\nAnd I'm really listening for the person that's going to bring the next level make us think differently and\nFor their you know President Trump has a lot of positives to have a lot of faults so one of the things that we do its foreign news is that we're completely nonpartisan I like covering the news an unbiased way but he has challenged people to think differently about issues rightly or wrongly and I think that that's really important for the civil discourse today whoever you\nAre to ... born in Saudi Arabia but work has contributed the Washington Post seems to have been lured into a shower or the Turkish embassy\nAnd killed a that was where does he think he's dead they picked up into steps and it was a big set up to Fifteen men are Saudi teams may have arrived taken him out we're trying to get to the bottom of it\nOh what does it stay here I mean we asked the president that here's what he said cut a cook thirty four\nChildren in America and you can be killing more or less has everything in every now sir is that in jeopardy now I have\nTo find out what happened when I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what happened\nI mean where he's extremely tight with Saudi Arabians a crown prince who's really running things that you not take too long and my ... well listen\nLet me ... dream retarded would Saudi Arabians a crown prince who's really running things to to not take too long and my ...\nWell listen and he asked if he wants to pass drought a turkey as well so the relationship with turkey is also tense right now to think about this story number one is a journalist it's operating freely in America I think just should be a lesson to all journalists and all consumers of news there are so many people here stateside that complain about the treatment of journalists you want to know what went bad\nTreatment of journalist says go anywhere else other than America\nAnd that's what you're going experience I mean it's interesting that this happened in Turkey one of the places that has the most journalists in prison than anywhere else in the world and yet this is this you know the Turks are coming on and saying you know the Turkish government's\nComing on and and trying to take a stand because they're they're not happy with Saudi Arabia so there's a lot of different undercurrents here I don't know how big of a stand the president can take on this issue I mean obviously clearly it's bad I mean what happened to this journalists you see some of the graphic reports it's frightening um but\nThere's a lot I mean there's just a lot ten actor I'm really looking forward to your conversation with Senator Corker I just don't I don't know what the I don't know what the right call it for the president I think it ... it\nOffers a lot of perspective for those of us who value freedom and the press and really want other journalists to be able to operate freely so we can all have an idea of what's accurately happening in the far flung places of the world I mean really important for us\nWith us from your top stories the Iran\nWe have a ... you know one of the big stories that was sort of I mean because this list and it's not the most exciting has been about got you know gas prices that's been really ... you know the gas prices are near for your highest we haven't seen the levels in oil and all of a long time and some I think this is an interesting fact Ryan every recession in the last five recessions has been\nPredated with a spike in oil prices so there you know you see what's happening with the markets and you see what's happening\nWith stocks and questions about interest rates and inflation oil as a part of that so we're really taking a look at that and the president had interesting announcement about wanting to make the fuel that's more a mixed with ethanol corn byproduct available year round and they're you know there's a lot of strong feelings about that\nIt actually damage your car Brian I don't know if you knew that but some cars can actually take that blends and um so it's really it's kind of I think that this is happening with fuel and the economy is a really big one it's one that we're really covering this weekend's Bernie's because it\nAffects every part of our life even if you don't drive so that's definitely one of our watching\nYou know and we'll see what's going on or economy's doing good tank yesterday ... point because the ruse interest rates because everyone will panicky but it's weird to help the war as an economy the more the interest rates go up ... to go down that\nMakes people nervous just because it's a it's a way that makes them more expensive for us to borrow money you know but let's see it's hard to watch the markets has every every other day you know you got to kind of take it in a month period and see what's happening but it definitely scared the people and when people start throwing around the world word recession I think we have to be careful you have to do it responsibly\nAnd we were nowhere it clear that near that were near full employment but you know we've been on a ride for a little while everyone's wondering when\nThey'll be a little bit of a breather and I think that that's a fair question to debate\nWho was is going to launch with Jim Brown and the president you know to a prominent African American wanted to know when I bleed activists who was the president's agenda should be a who should be their agenda and gruesome documentaries agenda on looking back\nAt a at the black vote over the last three ... three Republicans all are under twenty percent McCain Romney and Trump and the other three Trump actually got more than the other two\nYou ever see their rebalancing back to a party that actually read the sleeves Nineteen sixty and had the black vote up until Nineteen sixty\nI think when it comes to vote for anyone whether you're talking about black voters women's vote or Hispanic voters I think there's a tendency to just try to\nThink about all of them in the you know get these very specific groups that have very specific needs and and a lot of ways divide all of us I think there's some very you know there's some interesting analysis when you've got to dig into the way people register to vote and whether or not they vote\nBut at the end of the day I think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the um the results in the mid term election are\nWhen it comes to a different categories based on ethnicity and then moving forward I just I tend to believe that people are kind of affected equally when it comes to some of these major issues with the economy like ... you know can I get a job can I take care of my kids and am I safe and those are really basic questions that everyone needs answered so\nYou know I I don't I think all of that can change is it a long way of saying ... short answer I think all of it's going to be changing and I I don't think I'm just like we've seen as you point out in history of different parties represented different platforms\nI just don't think at anyone's dependable every party should be fighting for a vote and they should not take anything for granted or would we\nIs it represented different platforms I just don't think anyone's dependable every party should be fighting for though and they should not take anything for granted\nBob would we uh so how do we get smarter news\n...\nHer smart H.

in fact as going or right up through the roof where we're talking about we're consuming Seventy million gallons per year than we were five years ago\nSo this concept that was quite down just isn't true it's a blatant lie\nAnd the second thing Brad that really was not talk about it at all I was just spectacular pre posture as one hundred billion dollar plan that the governor put foreign that no one ever really questioned it would just let's go spend a hundred billion dollars to fix our roads and bridges\nAnd the reality is that uh that that that the the details of that plan were never tested and never exam and by the legislature everyone just assume that was the amount we spent\nWell you know what you're going to spend a hundred billion ... trillion I mean the more you spend obviously the more you're gonna have to raise taxes or do something uh we we're on the Republican side of the court were to an alternative plan a that was called prior to prioritize progress\nAnd ah it it's about Seventy billion dollars a quite a bit of money a and it showed that we didn't need any tolls or tax increases just to sustain that\nAnd as the up the special transportation front was going to be more than adequate so are people gonna want to toast they shouldn't want the tolls because it is a tax or but aside from that we don't need their calls\nNow senator uh we got that situation that the the governor the governor wants but realistically okay realistically how long would it take Gabby made it will be two three years anyway\nOh yeah and and Pratt you know everybody talked about this Seventy eight told locations yeah that's I guess what Brad\nSome of the reports some of the cause of reports suggested one hundred and Twenty one toll locations they were talking about going not only the interstate highways they were talking about going every limited access right away in Connecticut so people don't realize how we're going to be the only state in the country if they had their way that\nEvery limited access road would have been told no one the state in the country has anything even close to that\nAnd then they say well look at all the other states have tolls just weren't forty nine thousand miles of interstate highway and the country and about thirty five hundred told about Ninety percent or so of the interstate highways are not told that or Rhode Island doesn't have a toll until recently when they put the the uh the truck tool in\nThe only told they had prior to that was the Newport bridge\nOr they don't colder there roads so\nI and when you if you go around to other states it's only one road here or there are New Hampshire has an atoll in a limited part of the highway around Portsmouth and the and that's it so you know there's a lot of lives and distortion being done\nTo justify it and confuse the public and then tell the public oh it's so that we know that we have no choice we either have to have told we have to increase the gas tax\nCreate a crisis a precipitate panic in the public's mind and then give them a false choice ah neither of boxes are totally just tasteful and not really needed\nWell set of there there's no or a question about it and everybody and I'm Out a lot to talking\nWith folks and you have no idea that now it never used to be but now it's the first thing that comes up the first thing a robotic but again I uh I\nJust my my answer is don't worry about it right now because it's going to be at least three years maybe\nFor but I don't think we're going to get pills so I just don't think so because of painful just uh I I've never heard so many people are one right after another essay about talk about the tolls because they say as you say and I say it's just another tax\nRight and bread it would be ... be a close to five years before they could ever be installed by the time all said and done and by the way the projections would be if\nThey put in those hundred and Twenty one solo cases we're talking about six hundred and thirty five million dollars was a project it costs for that and and that's bad and twenty Thirteen dollars here we are five years later you know it's going to go up another ten percent we're talking seven hundred million dollars\nIt is not needed and that sort of throwing fuel on the fire by the way the governor with this ridiculous study this Henry and our study regarding tolls or is it ...\nThe way the governor with this ridiculous study that Henry and our study regarding tolls a is it's preposterous ended\nIn you know what it is by the way Brad it's kind of study again about whether we need tolls or why tolls or a it's a study about environmental impact\nOf cold if they're installed but why would you want to spend a million dollars and something I'd never been done it's not like we're awash in cash right now we we we well we are going to have a change of government that's going to be really important\nI had the privilege of meeting ... over a year ago and I got a call from ... Scott who was reading about this new guy you met\nWho seem at running for governor to lend you gotta need them you got an oppressive background and I didn't meet him back about Thirteen months ago and I I I was very impressed by him and the and he's calling impressive in terms of his education in terms of his experience\nOne thing that really stood out to me was he the listener he's not just the talker he's willing to listen to people and listen to people who know more about certain areas than he does\nWell you know one of the things when I first met him I mentioned the state income tax and mentioned that I\nWas there when we had forty thousand people the people didn't want it and Lowell Weicker said we weren't going to get it but then he gave it to us and we've had nothing but confusion since we've had that income tax\nAnd uh that's when he said look he said I'm not just saying it but if I Am elected if I Am elected I'm going to get rid of it and I know how and he explained it the whole thing so you know it's not just a a a problem is I I Believe them\n... there's no doubt in my mind you're dead serious about a ... ounce of just kind of a campaign gimmick or something like that I I again I met him Thirteen months ago and he was talking about it back then and I met our lack for the economist to advise them I mean he's put together a very impressive team of people and that's a good sign of a good leader to\nAnd Lambert Laffer was the guy that would help to Ronald Reagan\nThat's right he was the use of one of the supply side economics and try\nIt again and again Ronald Reagan when he was elected after a couple of years the economy exploded under his leadership because of of the policies and the pursuit and that's what that's\nWhat the ... saying he saying look we got to get the economy going again in Connecticut can I guess the only state in the entire country when the economy has shrunk\nSince two thousand eight in fact our economy right now is where it was in two thousand for fourteen years ago so that's just making it worse for us because of course we're spending more we have less economic activity going on which means you're going to create a crisis in ... the tax revenues aren't there\nWell I mean you either have to you know have\nThe uh you know the state employee unions come back to the table to renegotiate um I mean I you know honestly like I you know seems like a seems kind of like a long shot or you know people have floated the idea of unilaterally changing the contract\nA which is you know legally you know going to be difficult um\nSo right now I mean this was this was the big problem with this this concessions agreement that you know it was passed by it was passed in the Senate with the tie breaking vote by lieutenant governor ... Nancy Wyman and\nIt passed just barely in the house so I mean this was a very divisive a contract that was there was ratified uh but that was the big problem is that\nEverybody knew that we're going to be having these big deficit is coming up everybody knew that there was going to be a new governor and a new legislature and everybody knew that this was going to really kind of\nTie their hands when they came to trying to deal with this upcoming deficit\nSo you know what can be done about it that's really going to be more in\nThe labor leaders court as far as what they what they want to do and what their what their members want to do a cause right now it's a it's a binding agreement and\nYou know I'm a lot of people may you know kind of raise the red flags on it when it was being debated but which what we have right now and uh yeah it's going to make things is going to make things difficult or the foreseeable future because you know even even after\nTwenty twenty two when the the lay off you know but no layoff pledge ends\nYou still have the pensions and the retirement packages and things like enshrined into twenty twenty seven and there's not anything that you know the legislature or the next governor will really be able to do about that\nIn trying to tell twenty twenty seven and there's not anything that you know the legislature that Governor will really be able to do about that and those are some of our biggest cost Abby on the on the pension liabilities and medical retirement benefits but we're not you know but state never say or until recently\nWell I'll tell you a mark a I Hope\nThat in the next several months that we can talk to you or a frequently because I'll tell you you are on top of all the things that the people never get an opportunity to understand\nAll they can read it and and so on and so forth but they don't understand and you just explained it this morning and uh I'll be anxious to see what the\nAh the governor or whoever it is that selected a will ... will do about it if if anything and I thank you so much for sharing it with me this morning\nOr your bread I mean this or this is going to be this this see back deal is going to be like kind of the defining thing going into this this next you know administration so I'm happy to be here and always always have to combat\nFast above ... radio program and the answer to safety things stand before the seventies I talk of Connecticut so fast above ... radio program on themselves because they see things had at Fort seventies to talk of genetic yet\nJill Cooper Web editor Hartford Business Journal and the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee urge the U.S Justice Department\nLaunch a quote unquote rigorous review of the proposed mergers involving Connecticut insurers what is this all about well that's why Jill Cooper is here Joe good morning good morning\nMorning Brad thanks for having me on and you know it's great to have you back really we enjoy it now what is this what is this all about whether Connecticut insurers\nSo last week Senator Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee he called on the assistant attorney general overseeing the Justice Department's antitrust division to look over these proposed mergers of a\nSignal express scripts and CBS and now I'm both deals are valley to sixty seven billion and sixty nine billion\nHe's worried about industry concentration and and what kind of happened a prescription drug pricing and he he believes that there's a there's a possibility that these these proposed mergers are going to increase prices for consumers and that's the main theme of this letter to\nLight you Joel do do that and I was I was reading about this too why would why would that you know the the mergers why would that increased prices I Would think just the opposite\n[noise] well there's um there's some contention on both sides about what this deal will do for the prescription drug market um some say by streamline this health care model\nI'm ill simplify the healthcare experience that's what the insurers and CBS are saying um but on behalf of some of the people who are opposing this deal\nThey believe that it's going to hurt the market competition and uh that these insurance companies in pharmacy benefit managers will be able to control a market and these women competition\nAgain or how long how long job before we the public will know\nI mean it or is it going to be a [noise] there should be a big meeting I Would say could say hey what are you guys gonna do we don't want you to kill us what are you going to do\nThat will regulators right now are are in talks with our all the companies involved in\nUm cigna shareholders are actually expected to vote on friday a lot of industry experts are saying that there are expected to overwhelmingly approved their purchase of express scripts for sixty seven billion or so and the as far as CBS and now\nThey've said multiple times that they believe this I'm proposed merger is going to close by the end of tore Eighteen so over the next five or seven months we'll have some clarity on what's going to be happening here and if you remember\nIn two thousand and Fifteen the Justice Department had actually blocked a anthems proposed perfect purchase of segue nine\nAt in this proposed purchase of Humanae yeah so um they have a have a strong hand in this\nAgain when you look at the fall of these various\nVarious companies you you just wonder what is going to happen in the end what what is your Joe you're on top of this all the time and by the way you do a terrific job I'll tell you the hard for a Business Journal I think is one of the best now or if not the best in the in a state with what you\nTo a terrific job I'll tell you the hard for a Business Journal I think is one of the best now or if not the best in the in a state with what you do because you're everywhere and that's important [noise] so what as somebody who was on top of these things what do you think yourself your gut feeling about this\nPhone this ... and the letter to the um ... what really struck me was um a Kaiser report that was cited in the city in that report said that\nIf this if these deals are approved a signature CBS United Health in Humanae for control ... about eighty six percent of standalone drug plan enrollees in\nSeventy one percent of all Medicare part D enrollees which is um Medicare's prescription drug program and none of that that really stuck out to me as far as putting into context of how much control these foreign entities will have and I think that's something that the uh the department of justice was going to be looking at close with a Tony ha becomes so close\nWell just as you described it now that would be overwhelming it would be overwhelming\nIt would be and I'm not sure if\nThe market will be able to handle something like this as right um the shareholders are very confident and they've come out of time and time again especially segment of recently with Carl Icahn is a major investor and cigna he had some opposition to this deal and the shareholders came on overwhelming support the deal the very confident that this will not\nHurt market competition they think this streamline healthcare model will be a benefit to their consumers and they really believe that expanding health care choice will improve affordability and increase healthcare innovation\nJoe how long do you think it'll be before we the public know what's gonna happen [noise]\nI I think that's still a gray area and I think that shareholders um our after they have their say this week I think it's going to become clear and clear um opposition has been a\nSlowly dwindling as far as I'm Carl Icahn and some of these other and fees on my no the American Medical Association has also opposed the CVS at in a merger [noise] um I I Would say towards the end of the year will have a better picture of what this means for consumers and their whether or not\nA local employees for both a major health care or entities will will have a new partner\nThanks a million for being with us this morning and I know I'll talk again with his own\nAppreciated for I look forward to a\nFast ...

I always twenty twenty when he want to be covering something or you\n... the way that we cover things and maybe how much attention we gave to then candidate Trump or for any reason I mean you look back at some of the stuff\nAh and it's just hard to believe it at one of his campaign events I wasn't there I think my colleague tiny Jay power as well as she said that he actually brought\nOut Trump Steaks and put 'em on the table [laughter]\nAfter thing after thing at like ... it was just unbelievable so I think a lot of those that covered that campaign will always remember little tidbits here and there but but again I mean we're not done yet this chapter is not the book is not Britain I mean that is still going\nYou know of who their room ring\nOr who is going to walk into office with those dollars and having them spend it on you know programs and services and not keep us uh you know thinking about the future as we should be especially when it comes to our unfunded pension liability\nNow again would I couldn't believe for that\nI saw as of twenty Eighteen\nFringe benefit rates for state employee pensions jumped from I thought this was a misprint\nFrom Thirteen point six percent in one year and her now sixty four point three percent of the payroll is that true\nIt is true um it is true\nHow can something like that happens\nIt happens because of our spiraling health\nCosts and you know the parts that we provide for state employees which you know certainly I'm also a state employee and we have to provide some of those benefits but we have to be able to rein in some of those cars and one of the reason that gets out of control\nIs when you go into an agency and you don't want to say OK how much does it cost us to run for instance the state department of education\nWhen you go that far in those fringe benefit cost or not in the agency budget all of the fringe benefit\nRelies a sits in the controllers are thought yet so it's very hard to really explain to taxpayers in legislators\nHow much a stolen agency ... staff is costing taxpayers eight because it's not a full complete picture of exactly how much the agency is carpet because all the friends and allies and the controllers a budget\nAnd it's because we haven't gotten the control of negotiations where we are talking about some of the additional benefits of our pay structure\nGuinness change\nCan chains I mean you know it's got a we have to wait for the back for some of those uh things to change but we can statutory change some things which is why you quoted Republicans last session talk about removing the overturned out of tension calculations\nUm you could potentially look at the teachers a plan we have modified that are already um but you know again we're one of only four states that do it this way and when we talk about changing something statutory early\nBe immediate a cry on the left is you want to create a a you want to abolish the you get so that's not true we have to have moderation and we have to be able to talk realistically about\nThese huge skyline corners and get them under control you wouldn't do that in your household if you had one bill that kept spiraling out of control year after year you want to just\nSay yeah we're just going to let it go you would sit down and you would make some tough choices we need to do that in Connecticut\nWell a Melissa thank you so much a state representative Melissa Gibran my special special guest and uh again as you look at all these all these plans and we look at them all the time and sometimes seriously\nUh I think there's been a misprint or something because I Can't believe or some of this goes on a now I Know somebody like yourself when there are others like you\nThat that go after it but then there are those who who don't want to do or don't want to do anything and then you look at all other costs but when they retire and you just again think that you're making a mistake that it really isn't true but then you find out that it is true\nYeah well I think you know that's why you know I I I didn't know ... ... ah well I've been reading some of his plans but he uh\nIs talking about something that a few of us have been talking about at the Capitol which is a zero based budgeting\nUh it's never been done before God it's something where you start instead of\nHey what a what a government costs us last year let's stick that number in and and add to it and that is let's start with a clean piece of paper and talk about the most efficient way that we can have government uh serve the people and do it in a way that starts with no preconceived notion\nAnd I think those are the kinds of people we need to start a electing to Hartford because we can't afford to do it any other way\nWell again I thank you so much for being with me and I know that I'll call you again ah because I Want to keep on top of this on behalf of our uh radio audience\nI thank you so much for

just a great venue it is and let's forget when I interviewed Willie Nelson yeah what's your name sun yeah [laughter]\n... whose son on that one he called me off [laughter] he told me that what is your name that's on that and the guy yells at Yale is that spread day man who who [laughter]\nSo mayor how our what's ah what's ah what's new and interesting in that city of hard for it I Know you're always busy I'd Mayer's first elected when are you guys and gals are always running around others\nThere's a lot of good stuff going on and we we can talk about any of it but you know ... one of the coolest things I think that's going on and we've talked about this a little bit before bread is the innovation work that's happening in the city so we talked about the insurance companies that launched the accelerator where they're bringing in startups or the you know the innovation weren't they used to doing\nSilicon Valley or elsewhere around the country and now doing here in Hartford and Stanley Black and decker are bringing their innovation team as well as a advanced manufacturing accelerator and we're we're moving faster do the same thing in the day or the health arena\nBut last week was a big big global annual conference focused ON Technology and insurance ensure tech a and they're about six thousand people you know Fifteen hundred for companies that because they come in and\nAh Hartford had a huge presence there\nAre companies flying the flag the city there the state metro Hartford alliance innovation places and there was a real buzz out there a it's sort of this national global innovation community talking about what's going on Hartford and that to me is one of the er the untold stories about what's happening you know maybe just below the surface but really important stuff\nWell I can tell you what's happening right now it's alive again it really truly is what you have been doing what you have been doing and it's a\nIt's just a it's just come alive and and there's more and more people they're not every night but during the day and uh it's it's a it's exciting it truly truly is well you know I Know not just saying that I go there all the time\nBy your your your me both uh but you know I always say that it's always appreciate you saying that I always say we got a long way to go but there's a lot of stuff going on and a lot of things in motion and you know right now it's about trying to see those things through that are that are underway\nMarried you really is an attitude and little thing you really have to look you know I'm I'm a big hockey fan I Do play by play all the time and\nI tell people Wayne Gretzky had a great line when he was coming up soccer player goes you don't go where the ... going to be you've heard and writes don't go on that corner because of ... going to be an act\nOn it and this is really what cities like Hartford New Haven of Bridgeport are looking at now what are we going to do for you know say people my son's age twenty four\nThe city's like Hartford New Haven of Bridgeport are looking at now what are we going to do for you know say people my son's age twenty four something like that how do we get them to stay and rebuild and ... invigorated cities aren't\nExactly right and and the opportunity is that folks like your son and your son's eight I don't know about your sons ... for that generation it's no longer affordable to live in New York or Boston that's right and uh and people are getting priced out of those cities every single day\nCompanies are getting priced out of the land every single day\nAnd so the competition now isn't necessarily between us and those cities is between us and smaller cities like us and so that's why I think is so important that as a state as a reason and we really rally around this idea that you got to have strong vibrant cities that can be the heart of that economic development effort because if you do that if we can offer folks like your son\nAnd your son's generation at a vibrant place that he wasn't enough stuff going on it doesn't have to have as much stuff in the New York or Boston but enough stuff going on and enough people around\nUh then we're gonna be able to compete for them and that creates a momentum builds on itself and the other beauty of it is you know Hartford size can actually be a real strength or out of this ensure tech a commission that was a big part of the discussion look if you have a start up and you're trying to decide where to go and you want to work with big insurance companies were big advanced manufacturing companies\nIf you're in New York City are anonymous nobody knows where you are and you're never going to be talking with the decision makers those big companies here in Hartford you're going to start running into them you have access they wouldn't otherwise have and same for folks who are just living here you can become a part of the fabric of a community in a way you never could and those bigger cities and I think that's what a lot of people are looking for now\nIf you're just joining us or the mayor is with us like he is a\nEvery week adds a a missed a mayor\nOr have you looked at your calendar for the twentieth of the month to have you seen that yet ah because ah maybe you don't know where you're going I don't know I'm going to have you know you're going to be right back here all\nRight you're going to be here like you are it is a it is a Monday at a at eight o'clock and are you are going to be having a chat\nWith Dr Richard ... is one of your admirers and he uh is is coming by that morning\nAnd I talk to your head guy and the everything is clear is a it's a Monday the twentieth well I'm On a second by October twenty it as a Saturday So no no no no I'm Sorry they're twenty ... twenty second All right what does that can twenty second\nIf I like this are doing these aren't a flyer on my I got my I got my right here on out in an area or any of those areas do this is a in down in the area that he is so proud of\nUh and and you've done a lot of things there and he just said I Want to sit down with him I said of course you'll sit down with you I said he's everywhere\nAnd uh so I'm Glad that you did\nA show up this morning well you know ... Richard Frenchman has a ... is one of the early folks who stay committed to Albany avenue state invested in Albany avenue are located business there and do it and also it stays\nIn in ... involved in community or\nYou know organizations community meetings so I really look for that conversation and there's a lot we're trying to do that you got the Albany avenue street scape project underway right now or you've got a a Westbrook village in both park are under construction to take those blighted old housing projects and development a new modern\nHousing you know further up you got Weaver and soon you're gonna have work on going on Martin Luther king school on that area and then on homestead Avon you know we're we're trying to get the first job creation than about twenty five or Thirty years so there's a lot of stuff and I really look for that conversation with ...\nWell he [laughter] he looks forward to that to that is the\nTwenty second right here on this program from have a two\nTo eight thirty how about that a very good yes yes I've had her let's take a break and then we'll be back there is another area a man Mr Mayor that you know the people just it's it's growing growing growing everywhere\nAnd what they're doing [noise] yeah I Know you know our our hospitals are for health care or St Francis they've they've really been a stepping up in so many ways I mean they they already provide a world class care but they've been very very involved in the community and they've been very uh\nCommitted to starting to offer those specialized a world class or a care in in specialized centers\nI was just over to Brett groundbreaking for St Francis and and uh recently for our hospital as well and for them to do that work but stay focused on this kind of a you know fundraising not supportive of causes a great thing we should all be proud of that\nI'm Sorry but I go ahead no go ahead a one one thing in a couple of minutes we have left to I Want to get your opinion what are you seeing and hearing about\nI was just a great thing we should all be proud of that one thing I'm Sorry\nGo ahead no go ahead one one thing in a couple of minutes we have left I Want to get your opinion what are you seeing and hearing about the new the new CD rail service and I live in walling for and we have a new ah\nStation they're new stations being built a these lines the more frequent service now between New Haven all the way up through Hartford and into Springfield new casino up there wouldn't be heard and seen there how has that impacted the area\nSo you know the word of mouth or it has been phenomenal I've I I've heard great things about it uh you know if I\nCould always was even more frequent service eat up but that the difference between what we've gotten our we had the Ford is huge and the fact that you can take a train from you know New York or from southern part of the states and come up to Hartford without having to sit in Union Station New Haven for thirty minutes away for a transfer that's a big difference and the fact that you know you don't\nHave to say well if I go down I made missile wanting trained a day that's coming up and you could actually\nTalking with the mayor of what it Barry at Neal only very you know something or a misdemeanor and one of the things that are I think\nThat was a tremendous accomplishment and nobody has equal that yet\nIs the way that you when you were had a you know when you were the chief when you were running or the department and the way you worked with the young people\nAnd ah ah you had all kinds of of of programs and you didn't have any of the problems that we had in Hartford that we had in some of the other cities and that's the reason\nAt one time that I invited you and I didn't know whether you would come or not because you're so busy but you helped in Hartford uh I just want to ask\nHow long did it take you to create that before you became a the uh the mayor\n... the the most favorite uh Braddock the requirement to lift her as the ... program we created it up to thousands for you and Brad amazingly enough for now servicing four thousand four hundred kids every year wow the way on a we own our own school we own our own athletic center\nUh we only six other properties of the north side of the town of most of them are gardens and ah it's been great for the kids are learning how to plant supplying their families are prone to\nUm it's been you know we've gotten since July of last spoken and have gotten about for national awards over the last couple of years\nAnd ah I'm really happy to say that the ... of our listeners really studied the program carefully and as looking at ways to enhance the ... program in Hartford and\nA tyrant in as well uh we've worked with New Haven as well and I'm really I'm as a particularly in Hartford together ... has really um I'm [noise]\nStudied the programs carefully and and I understand the impacts of course a that it can make on the on the youth and and uh you know our cities today Brad are struggling you know our kids are an urban environment are struggling the poverty levels are higher and our studies it's no secret\nAnd uh you know we're just trying to provide these kids and their families opportunities to get keep them on the straight and narrow and you know here in Waterbury we've had a particularly a large amount of success but that actually\nOur youth crime is very very low um and ah most of the lowest quite frankly we entire country of cities over a hundred thousand so we're really uh we're really excited about the programs and working with marriage at first like men\nTo duplicate sort of these programs are you know in other cities in conflict trying to get\nTo see these kids now Brad we've got kids are getting high school scholarship so\nI'm In college scholarships or through the ... program and it's really fun to watch these uh these kids who are there opportunities for so limited before the program so now you put you put them in the right structure and like the Nextel just like any other child\nWell I'll never forget when are we went over in ... for the first time and you took us all through this and uh\nI I just could not believe but again what happened as far as I was concerned is these kids wanted to be part of it that that and they filled that right away while I'll\nNever forget that day because I saw you and you and I were just kind of you know one another and I thought he would tear down your face and I said to myself my ... really loves gets but uh\nAnd we're just kind of you know one another and I saw you with tears in your face and I said to myself my here's a guy that really loves skipped but a\nSupporter of the program and of course of the early stages had been enormous uh and it helped the program grow quicker and quite frankly the supporters of what a very Republican American without all the positive press all the all the community and the surrounding towns are really got behind the program enabled us\nTo buy the buildings set the curriculum and get the programs going on\nAnd we've really enjoyed uh we've really enjoyed our relationship where a building between the support of gray and by the way Brad now it's very much regionalized or\nA lot of our small community now are participating in our power programs because the the the just kids outside of what a parade liked to commit to Waterbury and participate particularly athletically with our\nWith our kids and so it's really been an amazing thing to see these gets actually are working together and playing together and studying together and swimming together or from the communities outside of Waterbury what do you have been a population here in the city\nNow one other thing I got something that I Can't miss what was the final inspiration I mean I remember when the uh that\nMountain was was kind of losing its luck and so on and so forth and you and your dear friend\nI decided that you wanted to do something or what what uh what happened how did it and how does it take place\nA hopeful Brad so a holy land or ... and unfortunately I'm Nick looking for for many years uh the cross had finally are falling apart and uh so is it really started in the campaign my current smear\nCampaign of two thousand eleven I I've visited every uh every senior living facility every nursing home won't do what candidates do and\nParticularly the elderly population Brad said now you know we we believe so much and you know wanting to support your candidate C and we're only going to ask what a paper in return and this was the common question throughout the summer and it was can you please do something to bring the cross back on the top of holy land\nAnd uh I had been talk in the first place is about it I was actually amazed at the number of people who\nWho spoke of the uh cross and holy land consistently\nAnd ah you know for it's a you know being for it's a bunch of there's something about it and we were we were fortunate archbishop Henry Man so I work closely with us we're fortunate enough to be able to put together a great group of corporate partner sharing the sea water brand by the entire mountain which is Seventeen acres and I'm\nAn unbelievable a skill or\nA manufactured came forward Joe ... of Waterbury a came forward and he said you guys bought the land of the my part with built across and that he did and uh it sits up there now and we had a mess up their breath three weeks ago now in\nOver a thousand people showed up on a rainy day I was the most basic thing I've been to quite a long time\nAnd it really is amazing the inspiration it provides the people coming through water and of course for residents and the region it's a it's a beautiful it's beautiful up there it's peaceful and the crowd is really a demonstrates are rarely but I think the people are pretty it's all about\nYou are going to stay for a while aren't ya you're not going to get thrown up a\nSlice of people as long as the people are happy bread you know where I'm In my thirty eight years old and have between the police balding amongst office but I really enjoy it but\nI my family a judge said in a and I still have a young one in high school and she gets a kick out a little hope but uh you know the truth is it's been it's been a very rewarding time but\nI had an unbelievable career and the police department I never thought of the top that but the last ah\nDied six and a half seven years here have been amazing to see some of the things jumping up and it gets done in the city and the support that we've gotten from my you know governor mulloy commissioner rhetoric or in the projects that we've spoken on that really transformed the city that go with a different direction of maternal\nWell that's a tremendous there are a lot of people think he should be governor to you know\nWell yeah it's a I Love it here so much I I almost bought it at some of those kind of frankly I I think this is where I Belong I Am Waterbury guy you know I get the I really enjoy getting up in the morning and work at a great people are proud that's a great city it\nSure

I Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent or you can't just brush this well if\nIf the investigation points to the ground branch and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally say he can't come to the United states and she uses bank accounts or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs the and the Saudis are not working with the Turks and the Turks a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest and not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states so again Laura you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral decision you gotta take which is this is an outrage it can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against the individual someone suggested it to the solution is going to be the inevitable road agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\nNow and they wanted to give the crown prince ability right I mean I\nMean this is ... and ... ... exactly and over again you know when I was running against are considering running against George W.

Atlanta in ... like say bingo where the borders we have no national sovereignty Without Borders\nAnd I'm I'm also perplexed why we cannot just stop books at the border returned back though and secondly on branding I Will say that the the left you like to call themselves progressive you're really not progressive they're ...\nThey're going back to the bad old days of the twentieth century of fascism and marks it'll condos\nAnd by going backwards there just who inflicting their brand of economic so called utopia on all of us\nAnd I just like they up random summed up and what they're going to ruin liberals liberty is liberal their ... their heads with liberty\nYeah ... and what they're going to ruin a liberal liberty liberal their ... their heads with liberty\nI agree with you I agree with you it's it's not it's not right to call them liberal now they got more migrants heading for the border a thousand [noise]\nMexico but it'd be told you better better on these people upset I'm home I got around them upset among\n[noise] my uh sorry Linda very quickly in Florida Linda\n[noise]\nWell I I rounded out it's not out to eat out than hundred I don't understand you know I mean my problem with it I Am so upset because the gunmen a mix sequel is reading that in the U.S happy they don't care icy\nCopy foreign aid from make the call a dog on Dora ... I'll be doing the right but we need to pull out the gate or I don't care what you want to we need to do something I don't think I mean I Am\nWell much of the alligators would survive that particular part of the country has some climate I'm not sure that that wouldn't be my first line of defense but I think your sentiment and passion is very much appreciate it don't go\n\nAway [laughter] [noise]\nI share park right to talk to you I got to get you to chime in on this uh Portland, Oregon violence over the weekend and also what we're going to see again at our southern border just in time for\nUh the election uh your reaction to the desire for lawlessness on the part of the left\nWas no ... no doubt about it or it's great to be on with your real about this for a long time now the political violence being advocated for by the left denounce being carried out by this group of thugs and that's what Anthony ... is ... they're not the embodiment of anti fish is ...\n... I'm I'm Sorry they're not the way they are they argue buddy metal fascism an American in defense of the frontline officers of the Portland be they're under orders but I've railed against the upper echelon of these police agencies\n... softness with which they're handling at\nThe foot elemental put shows up they show up prepared for battle they're not counterdemonstrators\nThey're not counter protesters they aren't insurgency group an anarchist group and the police state to be more sort of early on to keep the peace to defend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on once the crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think it's different strategy of more of a circus strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states as necessary because we are at this stage now and I I've been seeing this for two or three months using the term political violence of people on the lips go up and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not no it's on\nAnd this I'm a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago an end to flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for Bill\nThey start fights they like conflict and like I said a the police are there to keep the peace not let the stuff happens\nNot been but don't break those are failed strategies and until they make it clear\nWith a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protests because this has not pulled says I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentators I'm not talking about you but there are commentators uh on the right who continued to refer to\nAnswer the phone and some of this other political violence is when they're shutting down uh an intimidating people in the restaurant they keep calling a protest it's not protest it is insurgency answer for calls for the killing of police officers they call for the don't\nFall of the United states lawfully in to the government\nAnd I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation ah it's it's the type of a\nPolitical extortion too when they do it to the senators and and the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why is this even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to\nTo get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them\nIn in the halls of the uh the capital that should be allowed\n[noise] right and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators and ...\n... not much is going to be done about it and I write ... senators than another congressmen congresswoman to\nKeep their decorum but then some of this is happening to a private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group a in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to that we have to have more effective counter measures and and people say well what does it look like and I could tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they've you\nTurn on the other cheek taking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness in like you said lawyer you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to\nIntimidate an insight fear in people to get them to alter their\n... their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this political violence it's gone on for too long it's gone on\nToo far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is good I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the the anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and they we I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or along\nWhich I agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and other\nThan that about mob hit by people who do not want the health care for only about women who want to be listening to when they feel that it's time to talk about their prom I set for self because not about mob\nThat you're running and maybe the food would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is talking about in painting Brett Kavanaugh for inventing painting Donald Trump I and the resistance is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nIowa reaction to that\nSame on gun in Brazil you know but the Brazil\nOr I'm not too long ago we had a great conversation I Know and she told me the truth she said the stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it out when I hear people like her and I hear others not denounce\nThis violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage she saw the backlash when she came out with a book that really took the or the DNC the Democratic party to task\nAnd she saw the felt the blowback ... she better scurry back on the plantation and that's what she did at the end of her ... her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate\nMe those zip is leadership called this crap all for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do see anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not she's trying to to frame of narrative [noise]\nAnd um ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they try to uh\nWhen they're forced I should say to say that ... and some of these other goons this I'm a feminist movement was pulling their crap you know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence give tacit approval to this political violence\nAnd share of Clark before we let you go or the Democrats Stacey Abrams and other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented um people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claimed to represent\nA and now we have this is mad a crash about to happen again in the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with a with children\nBy this is dangerous to continue the meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on their stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody or citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges\nThat are in the constitution or belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing the the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nYou know and again this Congress must work with the president both on the wall and of course allowing for immediate turned backs at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening and it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America and to this country\nTurned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening and it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America into this country completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there ... there are no one's going to make 'em leave [noise]\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment truce it really is\nOn terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThis elite is broken ... immigration system to\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't steal the border we just saw last week we're still a guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen a beating has been deported six\nTimes lore six we've heard stories of people who've been caught that have been deported\n... thirty times it's not a made

maintain the house I I I Hope when I say we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're not going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship [noise]\nTo some measure of illegal aliens and let's see I'm Talking about ... and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that in the Senate that will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and I'll squandered [noise]\nTwo years for heaven's sakes with a very\nHere's campus in rocky hill proceeds raise toward better at outreach programs by a TNT veterans and Connecticut department of Veterans Affairs naked toward our veterans Saturday November to\nSign up and run the sign of stock car can out of ten sign up for their virtual rape and support are better\nTime is running out to capture the son have you noticed all this oh what's it going up in the area if you had at least for our design laid on your ... per day and a really good condition you may qualify to receive solar at new cars were limited time only Connecticut homeowners can save up to thirty percent author ... electricity bill not also are companies are the same make sure you get the ... and\n... transfer Romo warranty for your home for more information visit my age so let's see the schedule of free solar evaluation today\nIt will be our sci am WBRC FM HD threes Hartford goldie ...

is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes like one is used up and the other one is just getting started at that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired\nUnder the hood of that new yawn at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example for no chance I Want that thing but if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean again Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck a Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing you think about that it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I wouldn't think anything about that at all\nUh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice of car you one obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something moment and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but\nGenerally speaking the the I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote\nThe ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it um because I'm just I'm just really don't yeah I can just looking for is dependability and how much life is less than it was a cool question very interesting\nDustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey they think I think ... ... what's up\nI'm Seventeen years go on a haiku emir I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating shut eye in bed and I do it in China and you're going to college here I mean the college within a pilot program in St Louis and the olive tree okay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... ... the maturity and I keep them at the community college of either and you're right I\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... or but not by the maturity and I keep them at the community colleges they dined and you're right I Know of course yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that okay so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or\nWhatever Mm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it or ...\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and is a better investment than a mutual fund is\nAssuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\n... field of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the\nYou know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may\nI talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage uh with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study whether it's a two year\nWhere the certifications and the ... tech field\nOr or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to\nGive you the tools in your belt the educational tools and your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any of that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm Gray Davis an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can pretend for retirement and we're using the excess and our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine prevent that we're already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from all the coloration so when we say the thicker than our able to save a lot for a mortgage to toleration though is it okay to do that or am recommend they really are twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that a a ... choosing an investment for that or is that pension\nAt the end and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory it's a pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty thousand uh okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent yeah okay\nSo the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect 'cause I I probably would split the difference because I don't like the\nPension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through\nIts horribly run state and now we're bending on those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so ah but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line\nWhat if we counted it as a four or five if we Canada's before then that means we need to put it in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is\nI'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers was put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but you know as a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nI'm you know go do it uh that's that's what I Would back it off a little bit ... thanks for the Gulf\nUm you know go do it that that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit and say thanks for the call appreciate your joining us she lives just a day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid we don't do that yeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe that it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four and it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that\nIt takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board it can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend\nToo much [laughter] with drew generally true\nHave soil I also think that um they need to focus on why they're doing it though to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that my reason why might not be the exact same reason as his wife but at the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward\n... okay go what was your why\nRight here I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy and love are leaving behind and I think that um if we wanted the chains like we have to start teaching it\nMm mhm modeling it in teaching it yeah\nI Am change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and and it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what you if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders Illinois or some people that kind of went yay you be more nuts\n[noise] you know we have ah we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have someone who's had to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors that were local that were definitely coaching is on and keep going and not only through our you know scenario but also helping us leader view so ... ...\nBut not so when he came home that first time and said uh we just bought this car it's killing me and listen

college ... about how the today show he's taken out ... and I stopped contributing to a four one K. and see if I've got a beginner babies to say but\nI just feel like I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm not doing everything I could do my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand ... ... ... the two of you you and him a cash flow the scoop and stop the

wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather give them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason that it landed on the phone to\nKnow if it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers there will be going to college tutor lecture years\nWell ... maybe some four or five and six were simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and the retirement fathers kids' college what your cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt\nTo eye on your mortgage is which is the indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nPay on your mortgage is\nWhich is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of are considered that we should just have a a a three three maybe four months emergency five and then\nAnd then and then let's let them stop taking on student loans and clear him out\nAnd then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about ... we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay or the ... 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for what was the only ones only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good but then my son is still alive and take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to make the math work All right\nUh yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimum and take care of college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other one's\nLynn how about first we're getting back in the world one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well known as soon as you get your emergency fund merge and she found is maybe step three and then babysit forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nThen we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things\nWill start throwing it at the rentals in the house at your order of attack baby steps four five six in order actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent\nWere taking care of college and then if there is money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages ... is that there's so there's still a prioritization even though it's ... is is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skipped tree or two and three I guess technically\nYears given five or ... yeah yeah yeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you're on our lawyers with what you buy an order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI'm In the it's an honor to talk to you can go ahead and for you okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now the list and it ends alive for two Fifteen [noise] um [noise] I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um [noise] what struggling with here we paid ... one of the for the how the average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then ... and set out to the Haitian 'cause it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation are\nYeah so you're not an either how in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast ... up here in New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nThe dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in a main and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right\nAnd you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell you other than\nA is there anyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere they kinda specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurt the things\nTalking about your the real estate agent in that area is there's\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurt the\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that\nResort area the higher end stuff\nI'm not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving\nWe need to get at where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay can you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like do we say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising a you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line all there is workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through them and they realize where it was I walked away there were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor I'm the same set up as ours his hold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the law you know\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another will call yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do is go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone gonna look about ... million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it\nAnd that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the\nPerson that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you\nFor the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers and it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area and they and they don't have a central buyers for it and ... it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation\nI'm Sorry this is the day Ramsey show\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was you know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and simply wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to Iran's ha ha ha ha or out of the beginning so I mean I'm\n...

get older and ... and and what do we want to show then and then we had you know we kind of had\nTo have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's a beach with the legs that kind of stuff with the income you've got no debt\nEven do anything you wanted to

to see for yourself\nOh hang on to say oh my Allah or what the hell of we've gotten ourselves into so they ... they clearly had to come clean and now they're going to do is begin to they're going to absolve themselves as a whole and they're probably gonna pennant on ah\nSome of the interrogation team members and then they'll probably make that individual or individual sacrificial lambs there'll be punished they'll probably be executed\nWhen in fact uh they probably were doing exactly what they were supposed to do\nMake him disappeared like a Roach Motel to show each activity doesn't check out to the the Saudi conflict so that I'm telling you\nThey realize that oh we there's low we we are in deep all this we can't carry this charade and ms lie on any further we've got to just come clean [noise] All right so I promise that I Would come back with little music and of course we're talking about the whole list was Warren's situation\nAnd I got the Trump audio from the rally back in July which is a key here\nAnd it really is fascinating audio to listen to and\nThen we have the chunks of audio from the Elizabeth Warren little five and a half minute documentary short film modern life which\nIs obviously trying to clean up her little acclaim mess of being\nIt's going to run in twenty twenty there's there's no doubt about it so everyone that ever ever running for song time everyone what to sing along here I go and I'm On every now and we'll do it\nOne is\nSix and seven middle age is\nA one little is with Lauren everybody\nI think we had enough of that All right so\nAll right I'm not politically correct but isn't that I used to sing that so I was in like preschool I remember when we used to sit Indian style\nYou know you you you don't say now it's Chris Cross applesauce bears with political correctness you can't say Indian style and be more dollars is Chris Chris with us sending a semi circle the teachers to say All right\nAnd every once every third over here I remember being like a little while you know them for a four year old kid and we all we all sat Indian style and then one day some time but I think one of the Nineteen eighties boomer no more sitting in the style Alice kept the some of the audio here and and again\nWho\nThought that this was a good idea to shows such a modern new potential amount of Native American DNA who want to lose with Warren's team for the fence was\nSmart I I I don't know [laughter] I mean this bloodline is so scant this bloodline is so yes that\nI mean even Democrats are trying to say what\nThe hell is she doing one wants to achieve released this I mean this doesn't show that she's a quarter Native American I mean it potentially she is one and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American potentially\nWhich is I again I think a bowling ball has more Native American DNA than that\nSo why would she do it as why if you open yourself up the even further scrutiny here why I Want to live with why would you do this\nWhen the proof is not\nUnbelievably conclusive at Wal she is a huge chunk a Native American why when she opened up listen Trump is going to jump all over this why won't you won't put herself up the further ridiculed from a really ... the universe but especially president ... why would she do that\nAnd even Democrats today that are wondering\nThe same exact thing why when she engaging they're so close to the mid term elections I've got the answer\nShe's a whack a doodle I she she's a weirdo she is a weird weird bird\nThat's that's that's the explanation I she thinks that this scan evidence is actually exculpatory and helps her she's out of out of our GDP ... [laughter]\nYou know she thinks that Trump's haunting actually energizes her base\nA boy listen I as I said when we first opened the show I this is a clear indication she's trying to mop up this mess binary she made it worse\nWhen how low the potential Indian DNA is in our blood\nMean that's that's crazy I mean this is the same sort of\nThere before I get to the audio or the\nThe actual analysis was done by Carlos the bustamante he's at Stanford University professor expert in the field I guess he's consulted to like twenty three and me and some of these other a DNA uh companies\nA and a bottle and there's some stuff on the around that he contributed a to um Obama's campaign\nUm we're it's not the same guy so there's a different um some are trying to say oh this guy's an operative for the Democrats um but apparently he's never donated to Elizabeth Warren\nAnd it was a different bustamante the donated to the Obama campaign back in two thousand eight now his ...\nHis ...\nHis conclusion was called the vast majority of lives with wars ancestry as European\nBut added that the results strongly support the existence of an odd mix Native American ancestor that goes back potentially just to a degree of ...\nOne thousand twenty four\nI mean folks I ...\nI mean even a ... I don't know how to get to a thousand twenty four I mean it's even sooner than the in good film was where there was slice it up the garlic the garlic in prison so was waiting for the little rings of what I mean you can slice of that there are let's get audio and then I'm a squeeze in some phone calls\nIf you want to get in if you are Native American any thoughts does anyone think this helps Elizabeth Warren\nWhere do you think that this thing just makes them more of a laughing stock I'd go back to July\nLet's go back to a great falls Montana and here's how the president got into the one million dollar offer and now they're trying to call Trump on the carpet for this\nTopic oh God [laughter]\nI think either [noise] think of a [noise] she\nOf the great tribal heritage what tribe as a let me think about that\nOne [noise]\nJeeze base or life on being a minority oh God this they always want me to apologize for saying it\nI'll use tonight as I Apologize to you\nKnow the real poll no [laughter]\nThat was causing problems you know that name go because that even the liberals are saying that get\nThat hey can\nYou know the I shouldn't tell you 'cause I like not to give away secrets but let's say I'm debating Pocahontas right [noise] I promise you I'll do this I Will take you know those little kids say selling television for two dollars a pound learn\nLike Ninety nine bucks but I just I was born in Scotland turns out he was born in Puerto Rico and that's okay [noise] you know as as I was born in Germany well he wasn't born in Germany who was born someplace that I'm going to get one of those little kids and in the middle\n[noise] when she ... planes that she's of Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones [laughter]\nThat her mother ... we won't take that\nKids and say oh we have to do it gently because we're in the me two generations right to be very ...
