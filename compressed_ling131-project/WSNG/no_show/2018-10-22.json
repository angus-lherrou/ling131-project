I just can't get over how Florida is still in a dead heat with this with this race\nI you know we don't know how this happened uh my own reporting has been up to the deputy chief of his intelligence service\nI'm at a loss for a a has a been instrumental in forming a little while I was told was a tiger team to conduct the covert special operations last month we learned about this and of the reporting is that he is the person the Saudis are kind of a den of flying as\nThe the the the the fall guy basically the designated corporate [noise] um he he worked closely with the with the crown prince we know that I'm about half\nOf the people who the Turks I came into into his stumble at the time of this killing were members of MPs as personal security detail so\nHe's going to have to speak to the issue of his own culpability the ideal length just laying it off on well my deputy did this I don't think that's gonna wash\nWell I'm I Know it's not going to wash with the Republicans and Democrats in the house listen to what Lindsey Graham told us\nHow did I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nSo go ahead and we all heard we all heard that when Lindsey said those words on Fox and and they went viral in the Arab world I have ... friends who called me said every year of his listen to what Lindsey Graham said\nAnd we we we hear him saying you know the the ... there must be accountability uh I I I think you're right that in the house and Senate um people are angry about this I think President Trump understands that there there's a lot of anger out there [noise]\nUh but but again it's it's it's not that this was\nI think President Trump understands that there there's a lot of anger out there [noise] uh but but again it's it's it's not that this was a A R R guide the Washington Post it would it's that he was living here as a as a resident and as such was entitled to certain protections\nAnd uh we need to take that seriously and get to the bottom of what happened what was the breakdown why didn't we know more as as he is he walked toward that conflict or from which he would never merge why didn't we know more\nAnd you in your column today go over some of the questions you want answered for example did you know you want to know if our intelligence agencies knew that he was being targeted pursued like they knew that they could so he was actually in danger like he was you up some stations do you\n[noise] well I Do ah the ... so there there are two possibilities one is that we knew and people didn't act in a timely way and what they know\nAnd that really bothers me but the second is equally worrying and and that is that we just don't have visibility into Saudi Arabia here's this\nGuy was a power president loves them and and the president's son in law loves them but we don't know much about how he's operating so we we don't have that visibility so that's kind of effects that that's just not that's not a good situation for us to to walk blind into something it was as disastrous as as so\nI think this is what the congressional oversight committees were were were created for his moments just like this they should that should that's a very secret\nI wouldn't expect to hire anybody else the media would hear about it but I think they should review everything that was produced as ... you know take the psychological profile of NBS which\nCertainly is a CIA responsibility [noise]\nYou know it should be reviewed that that would that was a straight up what was the reaction of of people in the White House when they were when they were told us what they caution this is a volatile personality I could go down the list of Brian of all the questions I think should be\nShould be asked again there should be asked in private and asked in a bipartisan way but this is one where we got to get it right\nYeah I don't don't people the king is not in charge it's the prince and you say that if the prince who's going to be removed NBS it's going to be removed you say your last bullet point your column that they are that the people are rallying around prince ... bin\n... these the last remaining son of the founding king or a king Saud so he and do you think they might actually be a change in leadership because\nI think it's way too early to say that I I I just think that that our intelligence agencies should be should be doing due diligence to see what's what's going on [noise]\nUm the ... this is a moment where in truth ... it is king Solomon not MPs who's running the show he has in under the Saudis system\nAbsolute power and he can make decisions as he sees fit and if he decides that the kingdom\nIts future are in jeopardy or with the current leadership under him he's going to act I mean the one thing I've seen of the Saudis over many many years watching them is that they know how to play the politics of survival\nAnd you know sometimes I make pretty cold blooded decisions so um [noise] you know can somewhat as the person to focus on ... I met I had missed it at the rather a surviving sons of through them including some on [laughter]\nBut but prince I'm at is the one who um all the Saturdays I've been talking to us two weeks or\nYou know he's a person we think represents the values that can come on [laughter]\nSo so does it does it I don't get me wrong uh Brian is not a big movement ... are being very careful there were just watching\nThe way David but they're waiting for us\nThat's interesting and we're waiting for them to do their own investigation even though we probably have all the answers already\nWe'd have a lot of answers but they need they as they need to own it you know for it to go forward as a country that's going to war they need to own it\nDavid if you put thought into that type of thing that would actually a sweat the type of thing they come out of this investigation is actually a ... wage Democrats and Republicans in the house I was in Congress\nSo I think this is a rare moment you know we've had these very partisan into intelligence ... in the house of Russia you know let's just put that aside for the moment and let's say\nAgree that we ... we have a big national interests are efforts\nTo challenge Iran which I think are good depend on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's strict so we we we got to get it right and I think Democrats or Republicans are are going to agree on that so\nThat that writes starting point is to have a solid foundation of intelligence about about the place that people and the policies and everybody I think can agree on that and I ...\nOh and foundation of intelligence about about the place that people and the policies and everybody I think can agree on that and I ... I Hope I Hope the White House would support it and say yeah we agree with this this is the right that writes starting point you know the Saudis have to their investigation but this one we have\nTo do or not it's not a partisan issue shouldn't be a partisan issue\nI lastly I think the listeners need to know\nHow well this administration has been working with Saudi Arabia to achieve mutual goals and like the previous administration they're all in so we're helping them with the who the rebels supported by Iran\nWhere we are the Saudis are helping us to help bring around to the table by hurting their economy the best they can and the end result would be starving Hezbollah Hamas uh\nThen and maybe settling things down in Syria and the Israelis and Saudis are working together under the wire like they never had before so there is a lot at stake here by misstated anything\nNo use everything you said is correct or we have a lot of interests in common with with Saudi Arabia and as you says Saturdays are beginning to help us see a world where Israel is part of the region that set a rabid lives and that's really important [noise]\nBut this one has to be sold for all those good things are going to begin to crumble after a day that's that's why we need to seriously\nAnd that's why we have to read your columns because your contacts are as good as anybody in America overseas and in the middle east because we've had so much conflict over there in the past David thanks so much ...

say that is right on the money at the age is only talking now\nAbout a New England money that's what he's talking about the only the New England states\nYou show a let's let's listen to that\nAnd find out just where we are are going I Know there are young people out there the oh my gosh I tell you you got to give it to them they're going out and they are knocking on doors very politely telling them to vote and so on and so forth I think there's this tremendous [noise]\nNow we've got something that we've got to ... how do we do it though Tony how do we win this battle does it go on and on after this election after the next election how do you look at it\nWell the facts don't lie and I think that's the most important part is the fact that Connecticut's economic indicators they tale when compared to games\nThat's happening all over this country at a national level and what really brought to bear was just last week\nThe national association of realtors economists pointed out that Connecticut has the highest a negative net population out migration we talked about that about three weeks ago Brad yup\nThat migration isn't just that we're losing population that we are\nLosing people in this state\nWe're losing some of the most productive some of the most influential and wealthiest individuals that have contributed not only to the tax base but to business successes to land therapy to community civics we have lost\nPeople that said we have choices and we're making them and Connecticut is not their choice how do we fix that we think that by saying we hear you loud and clear and that the policies that we implemented has not worked when you talk about\nHaving the flow was increase in home values and and having that impact on regular people\nYou know we talked about migration of of of the influential in the wealthy and and\nBut but what happens is that puts the pressure on the middle class when you at home values that are the slows increase in the country it puts\nPressure on people who are looking at their biggest nest egg rising property taxes rising cost of energy\nThey see less and less in the value of their home and they're stuck Brad\nThis is where people have so much frustration when you talk to them is they're stuck in the middle they can't sell their house they can't leave but with\nEach passing day they're losing value because the state stagnating they're losing value because their cost of living in this state increases we have to help\nPeople and middle America the third thing I Will say this we gotta keep the young people in our state Brad you talk about it all the time our young people that graduated from technical school graduate from college\nAnd graduate from high school they can stay in our states because we don't have jobs for them\nAgain this is one of the big ones and you know I don't know if you were listening early early this morning but some of the kids they're out there knocking on doors very politely telling them to vote and I think that you are going to have in this particular election I thought this the other day\nWhen I when I read some of the files and it it was unbelievable the number of number of young people who are are going to go out and who want people to go out and vote so now that's healthy I don't know where it's going to lead\nA I've got something here this morning if you can believe it or not\nVote so that's healthy I don't know where it's going to lead a I've got something here this morning if you can believe it or not I don't know if you heard President Trump\nWas talking to some people and he wants to know if he and a miss is below sea could get along and talk together can you imagine that one\nWell I Do because the challenges we have in Connecticut Brad\nAre enormous and we can't solve it with one party and one way alone you got to do it in a bipartisan basis you got to do with some\nRational commonsense people get together and say it's not about party first it's about people first and the bottom line my point on the young people being active\nBrad they've got to know what the issues are not go by emotion you know my dad always taught me that if you do anything based on emotion usually regret it\nMy hope is for all the people that are engaged that are looking to participate in the election process that is awesome and it's great but you gotta do your homework you've got to find out what the issues are\nAnd you gotta look at the solutions we've talked about challenge here Brad yup but the bottom line I think I Would leave with you is this\nYou got to have people that says we have to have solutions you've got to prioritize you're spending\nBefore you start asking for more money in taxes from people you have to evaluate and look at government and what their job is and create efficiencies\nYou got to create a model where people have confidence in what you're going to do tomorrow and the next year\nOur budgeting process under Governor Malloy has been a roller coaster ride that schools ... and businesses have no idea what's happening the next day\nSo when you're running a business when you're trying to teach kids an educational system\nYou

are apprentices please reach out again at the U.S or to to uh uh kept workforce partners any number of places because it's so important to have those workplaces a step up and say you know we want to take some in terms of ... and show them\nHow it works the only thing we've tried to do great some year round opportunities you know we've talked before about the use service corps which is right now put in about two hundred and fifty young people to work part time year round of doing things in in the community that uh that they can see them you have an impact give them a chance to earn a paycheck and get that experience\nThere's no question there's a lot more room for that\nSome of our insurance companies uh have stepped up and are doing apprenticeship programs as well you know I Know that the travelers and the heart for both have a versions of that and then as you mentioned the police department I'd like to fish when we have a a kid that program which is one of the really important avenues to try to get\nHeart for residents on track to be\nMembers of Hartford police department and uh there are there are spots are coming open there again so I Would encourage anybody to reach out and apply for that but you know you're you're absolutely right about the importance of those things and um there's always far far more that we can do in that we will try to do\n'em and last you know that school you mentioned it is a historic and beautiful school and it is at risk of\nOf falling apart you know there was some were able to put some money and destabilize it uh it's got some environmental read a lot of environmental remediation that needs to be done but uh you're absolutely right it's a critical place on Albany avenue and we'd love to get that building a saved restored preserved\nUm and I think you know we talked about a before about the broader context of what we're trying to do in a in Hartford in the north end the Hartford one of the\n... from the very start the way we kind of defined mission in you know hard for a defined it for our administration is to to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make Hartford the vibrant heart of this region of a million and a half people\nAnd to make sure that everybody in every neighborhood feels like they got to share in Harper's rise and uh you know if you look at the blue hills neighborhood Albany avenue court or a north than\nA between the\nWork that is now underway to bring Weaver back a comprehensive high school in the north end the rebuilding of Westbrook village and a ... park the a commercial piece of the west village development will be right on Albany avenue the Albany avenue street scape\nEconomic development that's happening on homes that avenue and then you look down to the you know a little bit farther north of the sweat factory there's a lot of work under way that I Hope will not just help\nChange the the physical appearance and make it more attractive neighborhood for everybody who lives there but also a great some jobs you know especially in the homes that avenue and sweat factory those are going to be job centers um so you know we've got to just keep keep\nDoing everything we can do and and push hard aggressively uh and and build on momentum and I think ... you mentioned three things that are really really important to go after\nThat [noise] well and so I Would just love to see um some people step up a you know that that's a neighborhood right now that has a very dense population\nYou can't really get a hamburger down there you can't really get a pizza down there there's just a lot of stuff that if there's anybody listening here um you can even call me up I think anybody that's really dedicated would be able to do very well there and then I Would love to see young people in it\nUm you can even call me up I I think anybody that's really dedicated would be able to do very well there and then I Would love to see young people in the neighborhood get hired into those businesses and along with what the mayor is talking about some beautiful ... going on there\nUh I think that we ... ... and I just I even have some names of restaurants you want to hear from\nYou have said yeah yeah I Do a lot of thinking brand go ahead go ahead one of them is called Adam's Rib Oh yes a rib joint yup another one maybe for southern cooking might be called southern comfort maybe a ... you know he he he really there's no um\nThere's a kind of stuff has got to get in there yeah that's that's yeah there's there's ... and then if you go down there and it becomes a night is for\nA Caribbean food and night is for you know southern food and I just for ribs and night is for soul food then that becomes a destination in of itself and people will seek that out and they'll come down there were not that far away from it but\nWe need that extra step and the extra step can't just be through government the extra steps got to be through private citizens I Believe\nYou know I think one of one of the things that I I'm the host talk talk about revenue as we've got such an incredible a richness of cuisine of\nOf restaurants in the city you know not not in downtown alone but in in our neighborhoods you know amazing places like you know done river a upon north main um they're you know but we don't have enough sit down restaurants are and especially on the main corridors where you're talking about north main or Albany avenue\nAnd that's something that the neighborhood is really really eager to see I'd love to see us get some more sit down restaurants and you know an actress when you're making an important point the Albany avenue corridor has the highest traffic count of any street in the city there are about twenty to twenty five thousand\nUh cars that come down Albany avenue every day and all too often you know that those cars they travel you know from garage door to door at home to you know parking garage a downtown uh ...\nI think that as we work to complete this street scape or to try to fill in some of the gaps and development to get that Westbrook apiece developed I Hope that it becomes a a an opportunity not just to provide sit down restaurants are that can help a\nNet our neighborhood together uh and serve all of our residents there but also I Hope that some of those cars that are\nPassing through Hartford start to stop and spend some money in Hartford uh because ultimately you know I think that's an important part of a great opportunity creating jobs and creating place\nWhile I agree with that and I think one of the things that I and I think media has a lot to do with this is the stories you hear about the north end of Hartford are invariably stories about bad things and and I I there's nobody at this table even the mayor that sees as many people\nFrom the north in Hartford as we do because we've got a business there where we see a bunch of patients every day and\nA ... most of the people I mean the vast majority of the people are are very wholesome you know very nice people you know and so I don't think crime is very high in that neighborhood I really don't so I I wouldn't have my kids working in the neighborhood of that is what I thought it was but that's the image that people have and that image needs to be\nIt needs to be taken down there need to be real statistics what is actually crime in the north and the Harvard has not very high it's not a dangerous neighborhood at all\nI have absolutely no fear whatsoever of electrical yeah yeah and my kids are there is just but that's the image because that's all you see on television or even the newspaper even politicians\nPresent company excepted it um\nWhen they talk about something wrong with the state government they talk they say it's happening in Hartford but it's nice to hear it hard for\nThem to drive the most grave you they'll people refer to hard for what they mean is the state capital [laughter] you know the the you know the the legislature or the or the the governor's office but I Would do their pluses and minuses to be enough to be in\nThe capital but good [laughter] but it's like almost a dirty word in a you know the north and it's really a neat place you take a place like blue like blue back square in West Hartford that is a twenty first century\nA kind of an impression of what the north end to Hartford was light not too long ago in Canby again where people live and there's a lot of businesses and you can walk to things and it can be a very vital and they know that that's such\nA great point ... ... over the country\nYou know people are realizing the mistakes that we made with sprawl and uh you know subdivisions and separating people away from the coffee shops and restaurants and the you know gathering places that they used to having to try to build these walkable neighborhoods\nAre neighborhoods are walkable they're naturally walkable you know the upper Albany avenue you've got to a a great community that is you know anchored by Albany I've you know it's true in so many neighborhoods in Hartford not just their\nOf and so as people are around the country are reassessing\nYou know anchored by Albany avenue it's true in so many neighborhoods in Hartford not just their\nUp and so as people around the country was reassessing what kind of life they want to live and whether they want to be car dependent and be driving you know two hours a day or to get to where they need to go I Hope that people look back back to places like Harvard and recognize a someone's what we've what we've\nLost a distance ourselves from is is just right there and\nUm you know I think\nI think the city is seen a lot of momentum but I Hope that just as you said that\nWhole region begins to come back and rediscover Hartford and make Hartford uh you know there's again this is one of the\nParts of the puzzle says I Am very concerned about but to get you to live here is a big big step forward and I remember many things that we started\nBut just as does take a little bit of time and then they can compete in either the icy ass sanctioned portion of the event of the ICS

the richest men in the world and he wants safety and security but you know little people aren't supposed to have that little people are just supposed to deal with that\nDonald Trump has got to enforce

people down here in South Texas it that are very very concerned about this and we keep seeing this on the media and see what's coming and nobody's even tell estrogenic coaching kicked ourselves and our property in our families and\nAnd it's a big concern you know their safety or safety it just isn't gonna work force and um\nYou know what are we going to do when they get here and the calling or fences among our property and our ranchers they have access to our houses are Barnes are tractors vehicles the\nYou know there's only one way to stand up against you than you know nobody's telling us what's right and wrong and basically we're going to do things the way that we still have to be\nTaking care of to protect ourselves\nAnd there's no concern for that\nAmerican people that you are you basically just have to suffer\nYou have to suffer for the dream of open borders so Democrats will have more democratic voters and the chamber of commerce will have cheap migrant labor they want cheap labor they they want it never ending flow of cheap labor which ultimately ensure that we lose America period that's just that's just it\nWe don't have public schools that are inculcate in American history and the ... with us now historian extraordinary author a founder of ah surely bands for public affairs and dish and everything else he does\nAh but Craig the more I see this is this coverage is sob story coverage of the caravan the more I think about what these individuals would do if someone breached their threshold\nThan the more I think about what these individuals would do if someone breached their threshold in their own homes and whether they would ... you know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while would they of course not no commercial out\nThough of course not and we know are you know the answer of uh Mexico when they invaded there a country is is that the assaulted the police officers there well first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of ... justice\nHas some fun comical\nOr fodder a car you know a circus or something like this this is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no ...\nNo invasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore an oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president and out every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and these these are illegals and if they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not they should resign their offices\nI think again the fact that we are not\nAll hands on deck to stop this right in that I mean\nThe president is apparently the only person willing to really cold is what it is we don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico unique nor the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you better than the older they're not criminals well then why [laughter]\nThey have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why a gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint\nThis is this is ... from heaven for people like yourself myself others who are concerned about the sovereignty of this country now we've got now instead of a trick or them ... you know sneaky over under the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now\nWe've got an open massive out in the daylight invasion at this doesn't scare the bejesus out of middle America that nothing will\nRun again we want we want people to come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate the law the first chance they get or game the system that is in\nYou know is it to gain the system as it's as it exists anyway well the system now is if you want to claim asylum you come here you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then when you have to process them into the country then we don't know if it's for them so we really some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI but I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because asylum to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing\nAs economic asylum solely political asylum and so if you come here for the goodies for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to you know ah to you know to you know Conde yourself off on society without giving anything back but these people\nA word wanted in their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again uh the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on this yeah I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my mom soccer clubs and have my son got designed so nobody knows why nobody knows who I Am and my dad was my uh with my camouflage baseball cap on [laughter]\nAnd uh I'm listening to people's conversations about those people were outraged I Am outraged about this\nYeah the same where I where I live to is is that we're we're grocery stores weekend or listen to people everybody's talking about this and everybody was outraged about there's nobody is no reason for this except for the elites but the funny thing is that the elites never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nNo bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English\nOr grows no they don't want their backyards\nYes there are probably the private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from a ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in ... it's it's just absurd let's let's some I Wonder\nIf that's the other thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concern about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they don't want to do that but some of them I don't have time it's too dangerous my home country but that's not you know that is not a job\nAnd I don't want to do that but some of them I don't have time it's too dangerous to my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYes precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change our government they want to just you know get on to get into\nThe movable mob I liked that movable mob a mobile knob it's a mobile mom [laughter]\nMuslim mob is even better or none of this is what they want you run a caravan of kind of a fun\nAs rollicking group of cloud who wouldn't want a caravan we all want to ... sounds like a

that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is when he said about the Democrats' chances of a massive blue waves wave now slipping away\nBecause of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up um let's listen\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics\nYou know the constitution was written for moments like this bit assume that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed [laughter] why they made it so hard for us to get anything done [laughter]\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get\nThem right and we have proven them correct ah with with astonishing regularity reaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump gun to violate the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution the liberals were were were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and how did you move because of of all this other stuff that's happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embraced were simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just record I think the uh the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a a leaky faucet about\nAnother to unveil new

get something a a five five forty Laura well I have to say this that we have now\nA president who is willing to put our money where his mouth is meaning U.S foreign aid to Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras and maybe even Mexico will see\nA we'll be slashed if they don't stop these caravans\nPeople say that'll make the situation worse because then situation there will get even more dire in twenty Nineteen I think it's sixty five million dollars it's not that much money but it's not nothing how\nMany have you believe that we the people if we really want to help people we should help individuals\nIn their home countries and help them and their own countries help them succeed in their home countries helped them have the ... better tools to mail the reform their own governments\nThat's why I support food for the poor which is a great it's not just giving them food by the way it's also giving them skills sustainability for them so you actually can have a job to job and do it well\nUh but until we are able to deal with opioid addiction and homeless veterans and all the problems we have in this country I don't see how we keep\nHow we keep this up just funneling money overseas we must tax these remittances I Would slap and immediate excise tax on these remittances leaving the country\nYou're not going to you're not going to stop this flow well guess what fifty percent on each remittance we lose about twenty billion dollars a year out of the United states in the form of these remittances back to Mexico twenty billion dollars that's the last ah I

being made sent back home I guess what to pay for what will be this crush of humanity at our southern border\nGot to pay for in a bunch of different ways and that's one of the ways in five five forty Laura or will take a break Dan Patrick lieutenant governor the great state of Texas He's going to be down at the big Houston rally tonight Raymond a royal will be there covering it for the anger mangled coming off\nAll\nThe\n\n\nOr what is your perspective on what needs to happen now\nFirst of all we had the national guard all the border at Texas during all weekend we spend about eight hundred billion a year of our own money to help backup border patrol with our own vps Texas Rangers and other law enforcement airpower steep our everything we can bring to the fight\nBut Josh totally support the president and sending the military to seal the border this has to end Lara weeks\nI was on Fox last week I talked about this this is not just the criminal element that's part of this but it's also the financial element that will break the backs of state but countries in Texas for example a law all the criminal side we've arrested hundreds of thousands\nCriminal aliens in the last seven years committing hundreds of thousands of project floating\nThousands of murders sexual assaults thousands of drug offenses got offenses you David and hundreds of kidnapping said just in the state of Texas and you know I was with you back in June and I kind of broke this story in the media didn't pick up on it until I T came out back that up but I said with you back then in June\nAnd we don't have eleven million people here illegally we have about twenty five thirty\nWow absolutely eleven billion bumper is bogus totally unless you're now approaching eight to nine percent of our total population in Texas law we have six million students in our schools and about twenty percent or not proficient in English it is so expensive to educate\nThese children who are coming here um it I mean it's just expensive I our our healthcare system is Burton um the the this\nIs an issue that the country cannot afford with can educate by the cable cars right the whole world and so we have to stop this group of people coming um I don't care what their intentions are are we cannot be a country that that\nIs border was and that's what Beto O'Rourke that's what the Democrats want they want to open borders they want to abolish ice they wanted us they want to turn a whole country and the California we do now what's happened in California\nOh no no this is they want they want to California coming

commonsense just common sense on immigration yes and ... or ... absolutely a an inspiration on the pro life issue you've been a fiscal conservative\nAnd you demonstrate that that's a winning formula even in a culturally diverse states such as Texas however is there a tipping point in your state where if the Democrats getting control they legalize mass numbers of people\nThat's the end of Texas is a Republican or ten ...

about money all the time and then you've got the advantage of being a head of the curve on their way to go guys are rockstar\nSaying Well Don Cody and face Waco, Texas has paid off in Seventeen months making thirty one thirty than thirty you heard the story I Love and counted down\nHear a debt free scream three sue line\n[noise]\n[noise] well\n[noise] I question that goes from ... dot com found out for yourself why ... is the number one online retailer\nOf custom window covering you get free samples free shipping\nAnd with a new promos that they run every month you'll save even more use the promo code Ramsey to get the best deals rules and restrictions apply\nToday's question comes from Kristen in Florida they took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago before enrolling in financial base university I feel like I made one of the worst mistakes in my life you know [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return lease car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nMe take her car back that you own money on our signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and the other an already possession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference of media and you don't have the different she goes you're broke I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise]\nUm what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to\nKB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private say what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars on the whole\nProbably not far off of what you're going to find ... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so your bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diversity is telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the doubt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there is one thing you can do right now to take care of the little things before they become big things and that is checked

cash flow to it yeah and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the house talking two years and I said

initially gonna use [laughter]\nYou know get the thousand dollar emergency funding use forty six hundred to pay off their oath yeah but not now with the baby I didn't see okay that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total money make over okay and pile up cash as big a pile as you can pile between now and the time by becomes\nOkay and um and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April\nWas that event is than behind us in any worries are frets or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but\nI you know Eighteen years yeah there is now but I but\nBasically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then to use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the uh student loan you will of lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe have a lot of stuff like this is our ... our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and uh they gave me the boy because I have a lot of girls close yeah\n[noise]\n\n\nJoined us today room she was always a AAA eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee a Brittany how are you I'm good how are you they better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance heartburn or we purchased our life insurance and we got our\nPermanent part term and of course we watch the insurance or last night and we just got\nA block and turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and could we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are All right the permanent and just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh I I'm an insurance not or fully a permanent insurance which is what you do is it still bad shall we still just get the term\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances\nTo use life insurance and investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would say more new financial advisor okay here's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you\nHave a life insurance salesman okay they're showing you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switched to four hundred thousand just of term age and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which are a lot um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nNew Bedford mutual funds okay that's exactly what you're learning class was uh yeah so you already knew what they she said yeah he this language tells me one of those things are you this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant but he's a family friend isn't the\nI'm actually one of our friends just apparently gave them our number\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend isn't the\nI'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number ... ... and ... as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I've never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your car he said you know twenty or Thirty years whenever I went on and our term policy one then can we were eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything he sold you\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\n[laughter] that sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of the weight\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cause them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you\nAfter they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your body\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only\nThe face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is\nGone so you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you about ready to return and when you die they keep it all so bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what they've Ramsey is always there for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is all live on that myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get\nA horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and there was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I've never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty two year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nFifteen to twenty two year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies\nThe best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal whether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that's ... that's always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name to listen to people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again\nYet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with good with the help they usually endorse local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your corner homeowner's insurance you can shop most people\nSay three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major foreign nation wide in Asia [noise]\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and um [noise] but um [noise] and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere because I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them\nHome with a mortgage\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answered questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up times and then down times\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ... I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania had Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free or we can we paid our house off yeah the way to go\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to you know sell often investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that although it might not people's money ... that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun and I had the good problem I have is we were able to\nSell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollars that I'm trying to figure out what to do with um excuse about about the same amount in four\nOne K. which I have to be in the market um I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing the amount of money in the market and I'm white foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money by around ... properties\nAnd the amount of money in the market and I'm white foot homes we for about ten home and then I'm thinking about using that money by rental properties no outright mhm and a and B that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nIn ... um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor\nYep and then you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter and how much they go out and you [laughter] and so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to\nPay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a hassle factor I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market and got a lot in both but a lot of real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else would you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate was an internal right of return which is the tax benefit to the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less than some of it okay but uh I our our total with the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the role is to ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean ... you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories all the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\nThat and I ask if our question I'm sure they might\nPlay point was a hundred thousand dollar house so what five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each [laughter] now so I don't I own 'em out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else started wanting to buy tree and language for fifty percent\nYeah but I don't ... you know I don't I mean I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath read but I mean ... for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty ...

us or wait until sixty [noise] wait until sixty\nThe probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent so much less than one percent it approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very weird so I highly recommend long term care insurance for nursing home insurance for in home care insurance once you're sixty because Seventy five percent of your ladies will outlive your husband's so the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home\nFifty Seventy five thousand bucks a year cracks in scrambles the three hundred thousand dollar nest egg dies leave mama broke\nThat's a normal scenario at a decent retirement going into the scenario\nLittle bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone in nursing homes are not evil they're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids so they need money called payroll\nSo they're not evil and they're not ripping people off at home mom wanted to go to nursing home it's like saying I Want my money go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb don't eat there then okay some but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance is absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty when you have kids or not\n[noise] J. D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nA Dave I'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we got baby at three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through a few uh we coordinated it thank you and\nYeah and my ... we in there and said ten percent [noise] but I hear you on your show the twenty percent we'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then and one of those too so I'm just wondering what\nMakes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right uh uh the end when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second because you got the equity coming out of the first one\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay\nHere's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with the standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. fans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you write a took a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the P. M. I. when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared with country making it a country\nIt doesn't make a difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass\nOr mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay you get off on your lap done camp you know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the home prices market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenties\nAnytime you're at the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage to not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you right\nSo that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep choking on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset with an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I dropped so you're not known him for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it just but it's part of breeze and it's ... it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money wouldn't want to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that are in tune with\nBeing smart anyway Nick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty five I ah I I'm doing pretty well for myself\nUm I have a dilemma though my ... healers cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred butts at thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's been hot yes I paid\nWell below Kelley Blue book value and I have\nAbout five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening you and going through your baby steps if you want to be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my merge they've gone what is your and what is your car worse\nA private market is twenty three too I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars best ... uh I have no credit card debt mhm liar and I'm like are you single I'm Single and what's your income by income is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car\nThat's not only that and how much do you want to [noise] ah oh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year\nOr\nMaybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that day by the ... yeah I can I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand a year making fifty grand if you're single ...

morning the president said that the United states will begin cutting off\n... or reducing aid to these countries that are not able to stop their migrants these\nUh these these cameras banners from trying to come to the United states so the president talks about cutting off or reducing aid to Honduras Guatemala El Salvador uh this response to those governments doing jak squat and trying to prevent\nThese citizens of theirs from trying to come to the United states\nTo our southern border we had a number of tweets from the president this morning and most of the escalation of the rhetoric is obvious and I guess what I Want a tough president\nI Want Trump or Trump to be a tough here\nOn these issues and the sense of entitlement that all they have to say oh I'm scared of my home country and the United states has to let me and\nI mean that's BS and I don't subscribe to that I'm a humane individual\nUh apply through the proper channels and procedures di ... take a long time and most of

laws it's called being a sovereign nation and protecting our borders\nAnd again uh the world looks at the United states all they're being inhumane while these other countries are they letting people know fooling themselves into their countries by the thousands and thousands of undocumented individual come on me a break here\nSo we have the twins for President Trump or to go over those the president essentially declaring a national emergency\nAs this caravan is coming toward the United states ... it's not like a four and a half miles away from the southern border of the United states they're still Fifteen hundred miles or so away and it's going to take a while to get there\nAt if they actually do but still these governments need to control their people now the president also claimed in the tweets and I'll review the tweet about I'm no middle Easterners than\nHave infiltrated or haven't joined these caravan of ... [noise]\nAh the the thing is crawling with ISIS folks that are kind of there's no I'm kidding I hopefully no one just turned off the radio or the TV I'm kidding around\nI I have not seen any proof that there are Middle Eastern infiltrators however I Will say so I'm not jumping on board and say on Trump is right and there's there's no substantiate and there's no proof of that\nAnd I do understand the porous nature of the southern border after nine eleven it was always a concern about infiltrators or terrorists from the middle east\nOr ISIS or al ... sympathizers or operatives coming into the United states through our porous borders and that's certainly is a concern I must discounting that it's a possibility but I just haven't seen any specific evidence to prove that we have middle Easterners or a bad\nActors from the middle East that might have a uh enter these caravans I Will say though\nThat I Would be concerned I Would certainly uh try to a\nPost intel or gather intel from the field to find out if that's accurate\nOr there's been no proof offered by the president or for his statement but it's certainly wouldn't be it wouldn't be a potential vehicle for bad\nActors to get into the United states to embed themselves and and the huddle inside these caravans or to try to get into the United states I just haven't seen anything to suggest that that that actually is happening here so the tweets and\nI have these ah right here\nAnd again there's no an image queens there's no evidence or really any rationale for the middle Easterner allegation\nSo unless I'm giving you intellectual honesty here are on ... that's what I Do is the world according to ship a thirty seven am this morning President Trump tweeted\nSadly it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in I have learned border patrol and military ...\nCriminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in I have learned border patrol and military that this is a national emergency must change laws I I agree we must change laws\nAnd the president has the right to declare an emergency or if he thinks that our safety is at risk here but as far as a unknown middle Easterners mixed in haven't seen any proof I like to see proof certainly a possibility but there's nothing\nThat absolutely confirms that now as far as criminals\nI Would guess the the vast majority of these caravan ers are not criminals but I'm sure that there is some bad element that makes them\nAmy semester to who knows\nA ... it it doesn't justify the fact they want to Boston for the country now that is illegal that would make them a criminal [laughter]\n[laughter] you know and most of these individual I think the only crime they probably would commit would be trying to enter the United states illegally but I'm not counting the fact that there's there's a you know no opportunity for bad\nActors to a embed themselves or join a caravan to try to get into the United states so that was a eight thirty seven then about ten minutes later at age forty nine AM\nThe president tweeted every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes\nTo change our pathetic immigration laws exclamation point remember them in terms so on ... or so unfair to those who come in legally and\nThat's true that's a hundred percent right I agree with the president on that\nAnd the Democrats have been a structure is when it comes to a proper or immigration reform and immigration laws in this country\nAnd listen it's clearly a wedge issue this is clearly a mid term issue and I don't blame the president for also using that\nTo try to gin up support\nAnd to make people more alert aware make them angry to try to assist the Republicans in the mid term elections\nAnd then finally hear another ten minutes later a fifty seven am this morning the president tweeted Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S we will now begin cutting off\nOr substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\nHey up right up I I fully support them\nOr you know nobody knows essentially the bases ah regarding the middle eastern or claim a but the point and you know the tweet came in after\nThere was a guest on Fox and friends who floated the idea of ISIS fighters\nAre joining a the caravan to try to get into the United states so as the president like Fox and friends and now he he's been know to ... some of the subject matter after it airs but again I Love to see some ...

control your people stop them\nOr else are we going to squeeze us I've got no issue with that I Would support the president a hundred percent now this is the second time according to my count that Trump has threatened to cut off you know eight or money to these countries if they don't stop there are all citizens\nFrom making a run for the border\nBut it's unclear if the president's going to take unilateral action through executive order because Congress has not scheduled to return to DC until after\nThe mid term elections you know also you know the chatter of a middle class tax cut to a new wave new rounds of tax cuts for middle class that was obviously I I Would like to see I'd love to see that\nBut I'd also be remiss if it's a mid term election little like kind of fire up the and bring some good favor the Republicans some about ... you can announce a proposals for caught but there's not going to be any cutter any congressional vote on any caught\nUntil after Congress gets back
