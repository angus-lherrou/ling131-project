me that again are are just absolutely heartbroken and what happened and I want the worst things to happen to that shooter but still just 'cause he says he likes the term invasion I Can't also describe it as an invasion when you have all those people are trying to bust into the country\nA if a demonization of a word\nI think you know where I'm coming from a shifting years here are dramatically\nOr for a moment on Saturday Night or I should say on Sunday\nI thought maybe there was a chance that I have the winning Powerball tickets [laughter] of course the odds are or astronomically against me and I when I buy a ticket I don't have those dreams\nI you know those that will buy lottery tickets in their day dreaming or they're dreaming at night when they're actually sleeping in the ram asleep and they're thinking about oh my God if I win this thing what am I going to buy what am I going to do with it now I I buy these things knowing that might take it's a loser\nBut also that hey listen you've got to be getting into when somebody does eventually win or some pool of of of meat factory workers [laughter] with somebody wins but here's the deal my wife and I went to Harlem on Saturday nights to grab\nSome pizza we went to hot sees pizza in Harlem which is on a hundred and Seventeen\nAnd first avenue in the original pet sees the original from Nineteen thirty three\nThere are some other parents these around New York now they're not going to see the if you want pets is paying the got to go to the one on the first avenue on a hundred and Seventeen straight in Harlem and\nThen right down the street there we happened to buy our Powerball tickets for Saturday nights drawing and I whipped out of twenty spot\nAnd I bought him quick picks for Powerball drawing was just a couple of hours away and then I stuck my pocket next day I hear\nA ticket was sold to Harlem I'll buy you gotta be kidding me really so uh I grab my tickets and I started looking I knew that the Powerball was I think it was four\nAnd I'm looking at my ticket and I see I've got a Powerball is for my son about holy month\nSo for a moment like Harlem [laughter] it was so the the Harlem and I got the Powerball for that I look at the other numbers and um I guess they had like one but now it wasn't my ticket the winning ticket there were two winning tickets one was sold in West Harlem\nUpon a hundred and twenty sixth grade my wife and I we went the path is over in east Harlem and one's Seventeen but\nHey I was a good story for just a couple of moments but that didn't pan out and the other ticket was sold in a little ... the whimsy place in a convenience store in Wrigley Field Iowa\n[noise]\nPopulation seven hundred Seventy two not making it up\nTake is one of Harlem one Iowa sharing the Powerball jackpot and now we thought there was just a little Biddy chance there was a chunk of audio that I did not get around to playing on friday show but I thought it was interesting enough I\nEach if there was a chunk of audio that I did not get around to playing\nOn friday show but I thought it was interesting enough I happen to pipe bomber\nWas arrested and the news came down to the arrest on friday I was bouncing around I was watching CNN\nI was watching MSNBC I was watching Fox News channel and I did during the course of my day\nAnd I'll I'll flip on the NBC and Fox Business I'll make the rounds as I'm doing my prep from the morning until the early afternoon in getting the show formulated and seeing you know what's out there on all my news feeds and Web sites and watching TV and seeing what the hell I Want to talk about\nAnd the story breaks that\nThe police that they moved in they obviously had their eyes on this uh this saves are what job with his pipe bombs and he was taken down there\nAt an auto zone implantation of Florida as you know and it turns out that CNN actually broke the news first or CNN among the cable channels I Believe they had a first and Fox News had no clue\nAnd in fact it appears that Sandra Smith the anchor that works with Bill hammer for that late morning news block on Fox it appears that she found out [noise] the first that I think the Fox found out that there was an arrest\nIs they were watching CNN [noise] are you got to hear this audio because so let me let me let me lay out the landscape for you you have the anchors that said that those desks and sometimes they have computers up on the desk in many occasions on the glass counter top there are monitors that are slanted\nAn angle that they can look into their glass counter top and they can view a variety of things\nAnd in many cases the competing networks are run in a monitor either off to the side or in the table so the anchors can see what's going on if there is anything breaking on the competing news networks\nSo listen to this and when I heard this I knew exactly what had transpired what had gone on so you can you hear the voice of bill hammer first and bill hammer or they're ... they're going to break\nAnd bill hammer first is going to talk about age coming up this and that one listened to win the Sandra Smith the female anger when her voice pops him\nIn a mall is the latest with the fans are saying the search for a suspect and how far along they have or have not uncommon Katherine Harris has got some new information as well we won't have an all of that as our coverage continues on a certain other says is funny more\nYou know [laughter] so she he finishes up she thinks oh Mike is down and she must have caught a glimpse of the monitor where it said a breaking news arrest maid and she was CNN is reporting all ... and the realized that she was still hot and\nThat the mice were not down 'cause you could hear that little sound in fact that's where she sat down and\nThat was the Fox animation coming in what America's Newsroom or whatever it says and it just priceless when she goes on CNN is reporting so she was telling everyone in the studio there that see I I this is the way I think that it transpired that she was about to say oh CNN is reporting that they they made in the rest\nOf the well we will tap and all of that as our coverage continues on a others is probably more CNN\nCNN's report oh [noise] and then she realized ... so I think that's how Fox News found out that the arrest was made in the pipe bomb case that\nThey were watching CNN and that's how they found out an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine\nNinety nine of the nation wide number so I lost my calls grey let me know if there's anything a

before he was politics\nUm he uh he had helped\nBy land for a synagogue or a building person to God it's been a tremendous tremendous brunt of the Jewish people we know what he's been doing for Israel so this is speech is this is atrocious to up to date the lane\nIs slaughter I'm a man who was so close to the Jewish people but this one they\nThe left wing will do what ever they want to do in order to us they were the president and when the mid term elections\nMe rabbi one of the things that frustrates me as an inter Hungary senator spoke to this bed she said why don't you give this president credit for the things he has done including those things like moving the U.S embassy to Jerusalem and you would think\nThat a reasonable press corps might say the ... you know the president has a Jewish daughter and son in law and in Jewish grandchildren\nHow does this hit him instead they they seem anxious to to an end with other presidents if there was a connection of some kind you know to some things are in the in the world where they had a very personal connection that they wanted to know so how is this affecting the president and\nWhat is you know was he thinking instead a they're only aimed seems to me to say look let's see how we can lay the blame on him or for things that he said or done\nOn the media wants him to fail and more so they want him to the demonized in ... so that he never has any of public on or even once he does leave the presidency but they wanted to save them because the media is as you know\nNot do like most of the media what about Ninety to Ninety four percent of them are donate to to the Democratic causes they do their liberals ... some of them are big time left us and they're no longer honest brokers they're not journalists it's\nThey're not acting as if it were journalists who were supposed to sit back and be objective it become a propaganda and then Dr nation arm and they're an arm of liberalism in on the Democratic party\nAnd is it it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing here because without a affair pressed the American people are denied the ability to make proper decisions\nAnd dog and a rabbi ... who's the author most recently of push back\nAre claiming are American Judeo Christian east coast the other thing that came out and and I think they miss characterized the president's comments because he was asked by a reporter you know what what might have made a difference and and the reporter asked\nSpecifically about armed guards and the president said yes it it would have made some difference if if there had been somebody there with a with a firearm to respond to this attack\nThat took so many lives and they immediately cast that is Donald Trump blamed the victim for being attacked but I Do wonder Rob by what do you think there are congregations aren't there that that actually do a note that they need to to defend themselves is that something you think more\nSynagogues will start doing in response to a a threat like this\nI Hope so because one of the obligations that we have is people who are community to our family is self defense we have to defend and protect people who are in our responsibility and um\nI think it's a good day if they would have to have a couple of people in the synagogue beyond whatever type of professional security they have at the end pieces\nBut it will be good in churches and synagogues\nBroke a couple of people in conspicuous that no one knows they have some type of concealed weapon people that are trained to this they have a license to carry this in the times that we live in and thank God we have a Second Amendment founders believed in this the purpose of having guns was not just necessarily go hunting for Turkey's ...\nBut it was to protect in a situation like this for example eleven people were killed in some more were wounded if there had been someone there was a a a concealed weapon as soon as this started maybe two or three people would have been killed\nKilled in some more were wounded if there had been someone there was a a a concealed weapon as soon as this started maybe two or three people would have been killed that that person could have just not\nThe assailant the murderer the slaughter right there and saved so many lives but the left doesn't want to hear this because they want the solution to be that nobody should have an eight guns\nWhile the criminals are always going to have guns though there should be people I Know some of the guys that have um men in this and the guys that they have concealed weapons they've got permission from the local police department at the train it's very important that self defense what could be more important than self defense\nNo kidding and how many but have the lessons of the Warsaw Ghetto been forgotten already by the community\nBy the Jewish community yes well this isn't our our our difficulty is that we we have a very liberal Jewish community I Would say about Seventy percent of the Jewish community as liberal and they're no longer learning the lessons of history they are a mesh\nFrom from from head to toe\nAnd all this utopian liberalism a\nHocus pocus or they say that the messiah that they think that's the lesson of history how quickly forget right if people would remember the lessons of history will be safer\nBut that's a difficult it is and I think you know some of the liberal churches would have this it made up his gun control issue it made a got out of it and it's so foolish it's we're so lucky in this country that we have the right to defend ourselves\nThis the police come they do a good job but they take some Fifteen twenty minutes in the meantime a lot of people killed in that amount of time too many that was good to have some type of the dark shooter there who knows what to do that there's nothing more important in the Bible than self defense\nBecause that that's what it means to be a responsible individual personal responsibility is to just out of the people that you have really chosen\nTo be responsible for your wife your children your family your church synagogue community\nThat's a that's noble as the majestic adjusted\nWell you know right by I had the questions so many times over the years I've actually sat down to researched it years ago and and wrote a whole piece to Jesus Christ himself believed in the right of self defense and encourage his disciples to do that or to say you have to have the ability to defend yourself and then he\nDidn't just mean metaphorically the way I read history and I\nThink that a modern American should think the same way as you say with all due respect to the police and I love the cops when seconds count the police are only minutes away\nAnd I'm just you just know that my audience and my family are are thinking uh you know we're we're we're saying our prayers and uh we're sparing Assad for all those people who ... who were hurt and killed and their family members or by what happened on Saturday and thank you very much for your time tonight\nAre scares me can I get Lars Larson on the line 'cause Lars Larson out of the matter all lives lost and going up on ... Obama if you'll like you're a doctor you can remember that larger did you ... ... oh my dad lives lost and when a list thick went nuts [noise]\nI went nuts\nYou know you can damage that kind of what you said was false and I said you know what I understand that he made a mistake but you're right Lars [noise] if that's not true it's not true okay why did why would you have a different standard for this president then the last president when this president does it all the time\nYou know one I have lots of friends who tell me that their business is the biggest or the best of the longest time I think well if I really want to debate with you I could probably be chew on the fact but I also understand that some of that is just talk about what he's actually getting done for the country do you think\nThe mainstream press which I think you like a whole lot more than I Do like the ... and the New York times and and uh just the chicken noodle news network and and MSNBC\nThey won't give the guy credit for anything he got done ... will day\nOr anything I boy I don't know I think what we have reports I mean obviously there's been some turbulence in the uh financial markets a late but are there are people who are quick to give him credit and uh you know here at Fox News I think we look for opportunities\nTo properly deservedly give him credit where credit's due and of course Fox is the biggest cable channel and I think the wall Street Journal the biggest newspaper gives credit where credit's due\nTo notice how the papers that actually tell to the right to do a whole lot better than the ones that go to the left does that tell you about the audience [noise]\nI don't know I mean I think the wall Street Journal it's been pretty successful for a little bit of time\nBetter than the ones that go to the left does that tell you about the audience [noise]\nI don't know I mean I think the wall Street Journal it's been pretty successful for a little bit of time\nThat's what I mean but but I mean Fox has been very successful in the Trump era or and you would think if if we're told that people hate Donald Trump with a passion that Americans didn't want him that they reject him and that's where we're told is all the whole country hates the guy\nAnd and then the minute his approval ratings get actually better than Obama's word the same point just presidents they stopped reporting on the approval ratings and say oh\nWe don't know ... you know you're feeding agreements that fact is that when you look at Republican support for Donald Trump it's still in the eighties that's unbelievable it is for almost universal\nHave you looked at black support since you are black ... black support for President Trump eight percent of the vote in twenty sixteen twenty three percent support by the middle of last year thirty six percent as we stand here today\nBy the time we get to twenty twenty Trump on this on that on that trajectory Trump may get to the point where he is half\nOf of black Americans supporting him now as a matter of friends are\nAll those are such a weak pose with small sample size is that it's ridiculous but go right ahead so you\nHaven't heard about the black suit\n[noise] oh yeah that certainly Kanye West and others fraud\nBut it's not just Kanye West because if canyon county away could say anything he wants to but of black Americans weren't embracing at the numbers wouldn't be changing in that direction or would they\nKnow I think I think black Americans not embracing something let me just tell you but I think that anybody who's the incumbent who has the pope it it's going to have some impact but you're talking about starting at a point so low that increases are going to\nEspecially when you have a small sample size than a poll it's going to jump up and down but boy I wouldn't bet on that one and in fact going into this\nMid term election the big issue is not minority groups it's white women Lars especially educated white suburban women and given Trump's history Stormy Daniels and\nThings like the health care problems that we haven't solved and immigration issues we haven't solved they're the ones that reacts so strongly to the bombings there shooting over the weekend there she\nLays argue decided then went on writing or whatever you know what I'm saying the bombing is Trump's folders well\nNo I didn't say it was his he's not directly responsible he didn't pull the trigger he didn't tell the guy to do go do it but I think the rancor the kind of you know one of the joys of our time together on the radio is I feel like we're having an honest discussion we are or were different points of view and but I think that there are lots of\nTimes when Donald Trump demonize as any political opponent as not patriotic a bad person of criminal I I just don't understand why you ...\nYou mean rancor like saying you won't get civility back till you put our party back in power\nThat come out what she said she said you can't be civil with people who are uncivil is just like cold or saying you know when they go low we shouldn't go I Wish you kick back\nYou know he said we should we kick them when they do we know he\nDidn't want to say why don't you go why did he fight on equal\nTerms is Juan Williams with fake news he didn't\nSay that the fact that I sit back with the beer kick\nYou don't want is always

Donald Trump at this point is showing approval ratings that are in the forties where was Ronald Reagan at about\n... roughly the exact same place Lawrence yeah his approval ratings um towards the end of a second term or high thirties low forties but gradually as the American economy approved and the third or fourth year\nOf his presidency is approval ratings locked it up or to propel to relate to knock sort of re election in Nineteen eighty four but at the first years in his presidency his approval ratings are roughly right where Donald Trump's are\nYeah because you point out in your writing good when Reagan left office in Nineteen eighty nine there were still people in his own party who didn't like him there were lots of Democrats who didn't like him I Know that there are lots of Democrats today who weren't even alive when Ronald Reagan was president who don't like Ronald Reagan a lot of that it's based on mythology\nBut people have to remember that if anyone thinks you're going to have a president with approval ratings in the sixties or seventies is not likely to happen Reagan had an average of ... approval rating as you point out that went all the way up to fifty two point eight just barely above the middle and so if Donald Trump gets into the forties now\nAnd the economy continues to do well he might hit twenty twenty with some very nice approval ratings from Americans about how well he was doing the job\nI think that's definitely true especially if the American economy stays on you know we have although unemployment\nRate and it's actually on lower today than it was it any time during the Reagan Era I listen I'm climates replant today um is probably too much of those five during the Reagan Era so yeah I think is the economy will continue to grow and expand and as an as long as unemployment stays though I think Trump\nOr probably maybe beginning towards the end of his third year maybe even the middle of next year\nHe will begin to see his approval ratings rise too much like Reagan's debt so\nEven with the crunch down by the fed which has raised rage now three times or it looks like we could actually finish out the fourth quarter of this year or getting close to four percent GDP now I think I think the Trump\nWould be doing a lot better if he got the kind of favorable coverage that a a bronco Obama God for producing a lackluster economy the media seemed to be an slobbering love affair with Obama and they seem to hate Trump with a passion\nIf they were to to do stories that pointed out how much things have changed and how good things are right now\nEconomically speaking for Americans from might have an even higher approval rating the fact that he has an approval rating in the forties when the media keeps telling Americans no matter what's going on around you the guy's a terrible guy\nRight now I I agree Lars and you know one of the things that I discuss in my book bottled breaking ended up intellectual biography does that compare the GDP Growth with Reagan Obama for Reagan GDP Growth that don't even eight years of president average about four percent which is very strong\nSo it was nearly two percent I'm for Trump's right now it's it's been about three percent and the second year but yeah you know I I think you're right that\nLead it certainly always is no one will disagree\nWith what the point that that the media's been much harsher on Trump than it has been Obama which you know and they completely stay are considering um GDP Growth is certainly this\n... with with the point that that the media's been much harsher on Trump than it has been Obama which you know completely stay are considering um GDP Growth has certainly been stolen gr under Trump bomber but of course if it hasn't been yet as strong as it was under Reagan I Know it was nearly four percent\nNo it has an ... and I guess some of this is about times do change and I know that when when Reagan was showing these great growth numbers for the economy I didn't hear I hadn't\nHeard any economist saying it'll be impossible for us to reach this and the other piece that I think is not being mentioned in you tell me what you make of it is that if reporters were honest and said\nHeading up to the twenty sixteen election when Donald Trump was saying we can grow at three or four even five percent and all of them said no no no no the smartest people in economic say America has a new normal that different than the Nineteen eighties and that we can never get really much more than a tenth or\nA two tenths of a point above two percent\nAnd Trump is already producing that number if that contrast was being drawn by reporters and believe me doctor I say this because as a reporter myself for Twenty years we always I mean that was\nA big part of the job of being reporter is you didn't just say well the number is to this today a ... because people would routinely want to know well what does that number means you say well was half of that a year ago and it might be twice that a year from now\nThen that gave them some contacts for understanding what a particular number means whether you're talking about unemployment rates are average household income or any number if you said gee we got a lot of rain this year well how much do we get well we've got twenty percent more than last year\nUh then then that gives people out of context or understanding all we did get a lot twenty percent more than last year but I\nHave yet to see a single mainstream reporter maybe I missed it but I read a lot of different news sources but from both the left and the right I've yet to see anybody in the mainstream say\nAll the smartest economists said that economic performance above about two percent was simply impossible including the likes of Paul Krugman and Donald Trump is already eclipse that number handily\nBut have you ever exactly right laws you know the same thing happened in the late seventies early eighties quite before in the early years of Reagan's presidency is you know the economists are saying well you know seven eight percent unemployment ... percent GDP Growth that says the new normal but Reagan was inherently optimistic and in the thing that amounted to do better than that\nAnd like you said it it just because the price of the economists say well\n... ... GDP Growth is going to continue to present a you know it doesn't mean it has to be that way illegal is not the mess ... that America ... to do better than that and I think you're right ready immediate choose to be a little more optimistic and do a little better job of showing how you know the American economy has done better and can you can continue to do better\nDoctor burn is the author most recently of Ronald Reagan intellectual biography before a ramp up tonight with you I Want to know I Know that this makes it certainly makes a left cringe when I say this but it also makes even some of my conservative friends cringe when I say\nAre there are favorable comparisons to be made between Ronald Reagan president Ronald Reagan and president Donald Trump\nSort of favorable comparison of for example both raking in South believe in heavy to spend defense spending most of them believe that\nThat you know a strong America's better America a breaking of horse alone with Tom favor lower taxes both for for all classes really\nReagan of course cut taxes or every class so I'm basically did the same thing so they're definitely you know by comparison to the similarities between your prize at the other differences too but you know there are similarities they certainly are opposite\nKnown in fact I've I've seen that as well and while obviously does the communication style of the two men is very different they both are very good communicators\nOh absolutely they both are that are conveying their message on my ... message was always a little more optimistic and Trump\nIs a little more gloomy and pessimistic but despite that I agree that they are definitely a greater can convey a message is I was just can contend that what they convey as little difference I Would really hope and his last year or at least the next year is is president the trunk\nBecomes a little more optimistic and stop the Reagan lead and making you know the classic argument that Reagan made was that It's MORNING in America and\nThat our best days are before us and I hope that Trump the least begins to emulate Reagan a little bit more ... and his optimism\nDid it all the way from white lab coats you know doing experiments with bakers all the way to appeal you can get from your pharmacy and take is about two billion dollars if you can't get that two billion back\nVery few people I think are going to be willing to say well let's throw a lot of money into that will come up with a wonder drug and then everybody will insist on getting it for fifty cents a bill that that doesn't work nobody wants to do that and nobody will do that\nSo when we stopped doing it who's going to develop the new drugs to treat ailments you know that that aren't treatable right now\nNo one yeah absolutely nobody will and and that it's a big part of the problem\nThere's all sorts of ways to address to the price controls overseas in terms of intellectual property right or you know in ... with the countries and that's something that because we know we should be pursuing to to make sure they're going to respect our intellectual property rights and that's it I think a smart way to proceed\nBut you know price controls is going to do exactly what you said\nWe've had some great uh innovations in terms of cancer in terms of\nHepatitis C cures to diseases that didn't exist before and we did a lot more to do\nAnd if we if we stop on price controls we're not going to get there\nWell and see that's the concern I've got docked because I'm I'm pushing sixty at this point I have to take a couple of medicines but I think they've been out of copyright or pat and for a long long time so they're dirt cheap\nEven if you if you have to pay for him out of your own pocket but I worry that we're we're going to have all these companies say I'm not going to go out and spend a lot of money to come up with a new drug if I can get the money it seems like the uh get the money back\nFor what the cost of ... developing was and making a profitable and frankly for all the people curse the pharma companies don't curse him\nThey want a Fifteen Percent return it's a high risk activity if they took the same money and put plowed into a restaurant they get eight percent return in other investments they'd get other returns but you want a slightly higher return\nBecause you're doing a more risky activity that brings lawsuits and you know terrible stories in the news you make a bad\nDrug and you don't know it's bad until it's out and you know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand people\nA ... they're all kinds of risks for risk there ought to be reward so\nIs it I'm I'm just wondering why when the president's focus so much on trade and intellectual property up till now why he doesn't say we're not going to put price controls on we're just going to Canada in China and Russia and Western Europe you got to pay\nSomething closer to the real cost of these drugs and if you rip us off we have ways to punish you through lack of access to American markets wouldn't something like that also have the ... in other words if the bill really takes twelve bucks a pill to recoup\nThe cost and Americans are now paying fourteen\nDollars a pill and Europeans are paying four dollars a pill or because because they're ripping or candidate is part of being four dollars a pill why don't we don't Canada they gotta pay the same price we do and Europe has to pay the same price but the overall price will drop from fourteen down to nine Europe will pay more will pay a little less the drug gets paid for\nIt doesn't seem like a more sensible way to go at it\nBoth sit certainly way is the few restrictions we have the better off kind of globally things would be so ... ... ... things are always complicated so they don't always work out you know ... we would like it or as you were describing but\nI I think the sentiment is spot on in terms of it will we're having trade negotiations and we want we need our intellectual property rights respected and that's something\nThat you know it's it's important to achieve in pharmaceutical isn't it is important in many other kind of interesting it as well and that's something that shows that we we want to engage more with the world and in doing until we need to make sure they do all the intellectual property rights are respected in the the other point that you made which I think is also\nReally important to emphasize is [noise] it it made you and you're investing your money for your retirement or your kid's college or whatever you're saving for vacation new boat\nYou you're not going to put that in a company that's going to lose money nope it put it in a company we can't get that risk or tradeoff ... if you think about it is your own investment where are you going to put the money and if somebody said hey look we're going to slap on price controls on some of the most innovative drugs and you can't recoup costs\nOr you invest in that company I think most people would say no and I think that almost humanizes exactly what they kind of capital market process that's occurring why would you invest in a company that can't get to that kind of\nCompetitive with ... ... ... ... ... can meet your own personal financial goals\nThen Dr the only thing I Wish I Wish the former companies were out there more instead of talking to Congress talking to the American public because almost every other industry that faces these kinds of problems with governments and marketers comes out and makes its case to the American public and I think the farmer industries for some strange reason is\nGovernment should market comes out makes its cage to the American public and I think the farmer industries for some strange reason is being very very quiet about all this and that

soldier and this is America's no soldier there's there's several our nose soldiers in the actual to Louisiana soldier wants to but there's the\nFirst soldier of the first unknown soldier which is the world war one soldier there's a World War two soldier there's then there's the Korean War soldier and what we're talking about is the original endowed soldier and it's really a a settled in court and storied American history that\nI sell in the book the unknowns whichever way out and\nIt's it's really a remarkable story did not have the with with the conclusion of World War one we did not having another soldier for several years the um you know\nThe war department shell that they could identify the twenty seven hundred Americans that were listed as a male and they were in many of them had been badly ... noodle aided\nBy heavy artillery shells et cetera they were missing in action it was hard to tell who is who is still a no but they still feel that they could do it and um there was the thought that the that all of our soldiers could be identified and that really it wasn't happening and what what occurred though is the great powers\nLike France and England both decided to designate a special to for those who are considered a no ... it really represented all of those who had fought as the great war is a sense of of ... give me a sense of closure to the war\nAnd what happened is in the United states there was a movement that that was created interestingly enough it was a of a woman editor Rosa very popular women's magazine those delineate or boost\nBut that that was created interestingly enough it was a a a woman editor for a very popular women's magazine those delineate or who sort of\nYou know put out this thing that we need to have our own and those soldier and she created a movement the press got behind it and then the war department finally got behind to gain a a very influential congressman from New York a ... a congressman Hamilton Fish who is eight\nWho was an officer in what was known as the Harlem health bikers and this was a um an as segregated unit in during World War one um and he was a white officer in this unit they distinguish themselves in combat it fish really got behind the idea of an unknown soldier\nGets it through Congress in Wilson signs it and then\nBasically you know the anniversary last week where\n... ... we went the greatest registration units went to the fourth grade cemeteries and France where the major battles were fought this is Bellow or the use our God sand mentality even the ... fault with the British\nAnd they removed for unknown soldiers from those cemeteries they carefully checked the bodies make sure that there were no dog tags her identification papers they wanted to make sure that these were really unknown soldiers from America event brought them back\nTo show loans France where there was a ceremony and the French population turned out for this there were many many um those\nIn the population that have lost their sons to war and they really felt a connection to America they'll love for America for what we had done to help basically said France during World War one and\nThere was an honor guard made up of of the ... you know the Koran and the French Army that had really saw an action and were highly decorated and\n... the plan was for the for an American general to select the soldier and high ranking official at the time it was\nAs Andrea ... who is a tension he was the best or pensions and other friendships initials said hey look we used an enlisted man to select are on the soldier and literally that night [noise]\nA a an enlisted man was selected who was one of the polar bears of this a procession and his name was Edwards younger surgeon Edward Geiger who is with the nineteenth century regiment and this is the second they Beijing I get into this\nAs you were younger story in great detail and the and then I was 'cause he lives in Los ... whom do several times and that was really is distinguishing mark\n... he would he had effectively what was known as the wolf shepherd what was the precursor to the Purple Heart and he had two of them and younger was selected that night uh spontaneously because he had the best record of the other men in the group [noise] and\nUm he was given that morning a clutch of white roses\nAnd the inside of the the city hall she loans had four flag draped casket in\nYounger as words were it was absolutely sublime as he saw the flag over these caskets\nThe floor was lined with with rose petals and he walked in but he realized the gravity of the situation he couldn't decide and um he\nCan't taste around nervous late and then said a prayer and he said that the second casket to his rights\nHe felt this motion with his hand he just stood there frozen in his hand literally move without him moving it you felt like\nHe felt like the he had known the man and the casket somehow that man because maybe somebody that had died next to him maybe even took taken a bullet for him and he placed the flowers on the casket in that\nAs America's unknown soldier\nIs amazing the ... you know it really is amazing in one of the things you mentioned a moment ago that the war department even a hundred years ago if we're we're confident that they could actually determine who all these service members were and and you can imagine how much easier would be today\nTo identify the remains of a service member\nOr even a civilian uh who who might have been killed you know and and yet they thought they could do it back then and and by today's standards of what they had to work with was was not much but they they they clearly were intend on trying to make sure we\nIdentify every one of our of our last to members of the service and uh but it was it was smart it surprises me that out of the civil war there was no\nUnknown tomb of the unknowns a going going back into the Eighteen hundreds or\nKnow there wasn't and then the thing is a true American history there are large numbers of unknown graves or even at Arlington there is a mass grave of union soldiers that are that are considered unknowns and now you know that still exist\nOr even at Arlington there's a mass grave of union soldiers that are that are considered unknowns and now you know that still exist there's there's ... there's multiple areas where there's no soldiers\nIs there any ... or is there any effort going on today to try to go back and identify those service members or or simply too many years gone by ... ...\n... ... ... you know I I don't know if anybody's actually\nThought about it you know and another example I can give you is this shit um memorial that's in Brooklyn in their ... their lives literally upwards\nOf over ten thousand bodies with American service members from the revolutionary war and these men were imprisoned on on British ships\nConcentration shit or\nChips basically and their bodies were disgruntled overboard after they died and many of them die because they will do the ships were you know bill with disease they were starve to death on these a prison hawks and their bodies are just thrown overboard in their bones were literally washing ashore\nDecades after the revolutionary war and there\nThan they were just gathered and gathered up into a pile of golden bones and placed in this memorial which is in in uh near green parked in in Brooklyn so there's literally\nThat's a country that knows it has to protect itself and even on the very very grassroots level\nThat you would think it would make perfect sense to say we we need to have some some way to repel an attack like this the police will be there quickly but not nearly quickly enough to stop this kind of of of murder and and there were in fact for police officers who were wounded as well and so\nYou know this this is something that and yet in that very city in Pittsburgh last week\nThe school board voted not to allow police officers to carry guns at schools and then a couple of days later this happens I Wonder how the vote might have gone had the vote been taken this week instead of last week\nWell it probably won't be changed sadly\nThat you know we see this over and over and over again I've had clients who were told they couldn't bring their children to daycare to drop them off in the morning on their way to work in uniform because they were carrying a firearm you know and people have said well we don't need firearms we do need people to to be able to react\nTo it we just have metal detectors well first of all metal detectors at a house of worship basically would be running the individuals who support the congregation through the metal detectors and if somebody shows up to the metal detectors and start shooting\nYou still are started stabbing people are dropping an IUD you still have to have someone to protect them and someone to respond to that threat and you know it's really interesting and due to a you mentioned the law enforcement response an excellent law enforcement response the United\nStates about four to six minutes yup and due to an incredible military and an incredible law enforcement force throughout the United states we have lived in relative comfort with soft targets being exposed other countries recognize that these target need armed security\nAnd you know I listen to the mayor of Pittsburgh comments and he said he does not want to live in a world where we have to have armed security outside of a church will no one does but that's the world\nWe will and would you imagine I haven't checked\nBut I'd be willing to bet you ten dollars lands that the mayor of Pittsburgh has armed security with him do would you imagine\nThat there's armed security at the mayor's office there is in almost any medium to large size city in America there's armed security was public officials\nHad to go to a ball game at the stadium at a university there is routinely armed security now may take the form of state police were assigned to that event but they understand large gatherings of people are are often the target of Mad Men like this Robert Ballard\nWhile it would not surprise me if the mayor of Pittsburgh it's a large enough city and I\nVisited it's great city I wouldn't surprise me if there is armed security but with you know people don't even realize at conferences that law enforcement conferences we'd had armed security outside of the doors before and and even though law enforcement tends to be a harder target\nThere's a vulnerability there when people are not focused on their own safety\nSo how do we fix this problem I mean because if we have institutions like those who say and I'm not for forcing it on them but how do we how do we stop this problem if the people who are perhaps a the most attractive targets to nuts\nBut how do we how do we stop this problem if the people who are perhaps a the most attractive targets the nuts like Robert Bowers will not protect themselves\nWell the first thing is be realistic and stop living in a dream world you can't say to yourself well we don't want bad things to happen here and therefore they won't happen\nBut that's just not realistic in addition you know my farm has been retain several times to help design security programs a train people inside of houses of worship because there's a recognition that there is a different risk for a little church\nThan there is for a church in the downtown area with a lot of exposure\nWhere the congregation meeting times are published on a bill big billboard out and fun and the realistic nature of the assessment um has to be done and to deny it really is not only to deny the truth but it's to put people at risk as we said\nWell and I think about the fact that most houses of worship in the United states are open some of them are open twenty four hours a day which is great and it fits right in with the message the most religious denominations believe in but if you're going to be open twenty four hours a day\nIf you're going to have a door that is open to all then I think you have a duty to protect the people there and that's not to blame the people who lost their lives on Saturday is to say I wish\nWe could have made sure that they were still alive today Lance thanks for what you're doing all mentioning because usually do but when cops killing blue

the leading ah\nWell he's he's only four points only he's only four points\nBehind the leading candidate and uh I I think that the ah\n... would make a tremendous governor I mean this guy really has it\nHe uh and in fact in fact uh I\nMentioned this earlier this morning that he's had\nThe same the same folks that are worked for Ronald Reagan out in California and and I met him back\nWhen he first announced and a and this is a who's been handling a ... a campaign and he he just got it he's it's something I Believe that we need right now I hear in this town and it is I think\nI I think so I mean I'm fortunate to bars but such so low as far as doing better for the states and and uh you know our current governor but\nI think it'll it'll do your job and and and I'm Still really disappointed I read about because I I I still maintain that if I was ... rage stuff now if you would have had the lead by now but you know let's let's just really hope you can you hold off even more I was just it

G. news junkie dot com our of voter guide and uh I'll tell you something right now are the candidate questionnaire back for a third time\nTo help you kinda navigate what is shaping up to be one of the hardest fought elections of our lifetime and Christine is is with me this morning and Christine\nOr good morning good morning\nOr good morning a great to have you with us in just before you came in\nI got the very latest Quinnipiac University poll\nAnd a Bob ... is only three or four points for points behind Ned Lamont and uh I'll tell you this is a big big thing and I think he's going to win it I really do that's my gut feeling\nYeah so I went back and this morning I look at Quinnipiac University and their polling and the two thousand ten\nAnd the the two thousand fourteen race and and the thousand um see that and then they actually had it at a dead heat forty three percent forty three percent for Governor Malloy and Tom Foley\nAnd then and the thousand fourteen they actually had Tom Foley ahead by three points and the last poll before the election\nUh though I mean they've been pretty good and and within that margin of error so I I Believe the margin of error I don't have it in front of me I Believe the margin of error and the recent poll is four percent\nWell again this is a a that was what do you know I I I'd be very honest with you he is my candidate there's no question about it we got to have a change that's that's me\nUh that was what do you know I I I'd be very honest with you he is my candidate there's no question about it\nWe got to have a change that's that's me\nAnd I'm not trying to put you on the spot or read anything\nCan happen I mean I think that the the recent poll shows that are\nSo Lamont was in the last Quinnipiac or did it was October tenth and that last poll showed that\nLamont support was around forty seven percent and that's where I actually the same percentage that he got in this poll so it seems to be and I don't feel like anything happened during the time that they were in the field for the poll that would have um\nThat would have really influenced a ... you know a ... the outcome of this whole um so you know his support has seemed to hold steady and ... seems to continue to gain on him\nA again it pretty exciting or this year but you know I liked your introduction that this is one of the hardest fought elections of our lifetime it\nReally is a hard fought election here I mean you know what's interesting is that you have\nYou have a lot of conflicting\nThemes and and trends in this campaign issue\nAnd ... you know Connecticut will Connecticut be part of this you know\nDemocratic blue wave so you've got that dynamic but you also have a dynamic as a an aunt time away a sentiment and does that anti amyloid sentiment a transfer over to Ned Lamont chances\nSo they're kind of these you know this I don't know\nUm these conflicts of which steam Connecticut actually going to hit on and it depends on who comes out to the you know to vote 'em do more younger millennials come out to vote because traditionally they they had that\nUm you know so who can you know who who arena the at the polls on on November sect\nLet me ask you this uh uh uh what do you think the reason is that the step announced he has gained this kind of ground\nYou know I I Am not sure um you know to the newspaper endorsements for kind of like all over the board\nOf the wall Street Journal going for his death announced gay or the hard for current going for us grieve all you have the hurts Connecticut media going for 'em now Lamont um ... you know I I don't know what necessarily I think voters are frustrated in this state\nUm and you know I think that I think you're correct in that people do want change and who defines themselves as the change candidate um is what this election going to be about\nYou know something I think you just do the whole run I think you but you know suddenly you always do you know what you're talking about your say you know somebody asked me the other day when was it and I remember but I I'm not sure of the year when was it that you started this whole thing yourself when you just you know I\nActually I didn't start it so I bought it in two thousand two\nThousand and six yeah\nI bought it from my friend who had started it and two thousand five I'm Down the line before he went and he got a job or out in California um so I didn't necessarily garden [laughter]\nWell I I I you know I've been running it since two thousand six\nWell I'll tell you something or you have done you really really you really have done as a a tremendous a ... a tremendous job and you can tell that you you love your love what you do a a a\nChristian and it's important this this kind of reporting that you do editor of the or a CD news or a junkie and ... and by the way that's another question somebody asked me this how did you come up with a name junkie\nSo I did it [laughter] you didn't either I didn't come up with a name because I bought the the site from somebody else oh I didn't\nI didn't necessarily um I didn't necessarily picket or think about it or it wasn't mine um I I just ended up purchasing it so um I I Can't claim no credit for the name of the site [laughter] well\nI'll tell you this is a this is what you said it said it was this is there's no question it's\nThe hardest fought elections that I can remember and it's probably the most important we've got to we've got to have a change I mean this has gone on and on and on and uh I'm a bit too and there's so many people that are disappointed and are are there are leaving\nGovernor doesn't do everything by themselves\nI'm a white a bit too and there's so many people that are disappointed and uh they're leaving\nGovernor doesn't do everything by themselves oh I Know that the house and Senate races are also very important and so that's also kind of why we we started this voter guide\nSo that three years of doing this voter guide is to give voters as much information about a candidate as we can because I Know that the the news industry as a whole has um has shrunk um and so to be able to give candidates or a platform to answer some questions and for\nA vote or to be able to look and see where their candidate stands on some of the issues before they go to the voting booth um you know there's more than a four hundred and and I think it's four hundred and fifty candidates running for for office this year so\nI'm at the at the pretty daunting has to be able to um\nWith that plan you pay a monthly premium right um but some people are paying more like in the F plan for example they're paying more to cover everything and if they were in a different plan\nSo sometimes they can pay five hundred dollars more in a year while to cover a one hundred and eighty five dollar deductible so they're paying an additional one of four hundred five hundred dollars a year to cover a hundred and eighty five dollars\nBecause they don't want to see any bills and I understand that but we just want to make sure people understand that they are paying that much more because sometimes people want to save every penny they can you know because it doesn't make sense to pay more for insurance then you have to\nI'm Talking with a magnet for the have known her for a long time she and her husband have a very very\nSuccessful business American a senior she your benefits or I Want to give you the the phone number two you folks that are listening now you can call anytime and you'll be taken care of that is guaranteed\nEight six zero six seven six zero two six zero eight six zero six seven six zero to\n... six zero and I've known a Maggie for for Twenty years or right here and ah\nHer husband ... and ... are quite a quite a team and you know a ... the wonderful thing or two ... and you might as well here it when we\nDo something with you OK I always those you send those little booklets Oh yes yeah a lot of calls for those right\nWe do because they're very informative and they discuss the options that you happy train Medicare supplements and Medicare Advantage plans\nBut just the understanding of what those plans are\nVersus ... all the different carriers that are reaching out to people it's more of an underlying knowledge of what is the difference between the two plans a Medicare supplements which I just spoke about\nBut the advantage plans people love them too and they have their fit as well there is zero premium most carriers have zero premium plan\nAnd um people here that and they say well my friend is paying now saying why do I have to pay a premium again it's a difference between what people prefer\nThe the HMO plants you have a network they have additional benefits in the HMO plans\nDental ... vision um ... they have silver sneakers the supplements some of the supplemental silver snake lovers leakers\nSome of the supplements have silver sneakers and what I Love is everybody to utilize that which is great because um people are getting out they're living longer they're working out and they loved the silver sneaker piece of it and the plants have these extra benefits dental ... in particular\nUm a lot of these HMOs plans for next year have really enhanced or dental coverage so which is good for people as well\nNow let me let me ask you this I'm ... I'm going to give the number a couple of times a former because but I can ... can you send them one of those pamphlets\nYet so it is they want information to describe the difference\nI got one of those and they have everything\nInformative yeah absolutely we can send the information and being that we only have until December seventh to make changes\nIt was and they have everything ... for a minute yeah absolutely we can send the information and being that we only have until December seventh can make changes um for enrollment period they can request someone to come out and review their plan as well either whatever they prefer\n... okay so this is the number that you should call my friends I'm telling you right now and you will get\n... everything that you need guaranteed\nEverything Maggie and her husband put together a company and the over the years they've worked very very hard but they're there for you and this is one of the things that I I learned right away you know you got some of these companies they tell you there\nFor you but do you find out that there really aren't but you don't have to worry\nA with the ... with the uh Maggie and and her husband you're really really adult eight\nSix zero six seven six zero two six zero eight six zero six seven six zero two six zero and if they call that number they can get this uh this pamphlet\nThat I'm Talking about they can get the Buckley it's Medicare made clear um they can make quest in from you know to be seen by someone in the office by me our any one of our agents in the office we are all certified with all the carriers that do business in Connecticut\nAnd I just want to make a point of saying that\nIf they work with us versus going direct to an eight hundred number direct to the carriers there's no cost difference ... there was no different\nThe difference that we make is that we like to look at all the options that are available not just one carrier we look at all the options and we present\nWhy one may be better than the other one based on prescriptions and whether or not their doctors are in the network ... that's important too\nWell you know you're very special and and so sure your husband no\nI was just I was just thinking when I saw you come in a you know when you started uh did you think you are going to really be there's I mean you really you just\nTook over and you've got some wonderful people working with you where did you find them I mean\nWe've been blessed by the people that we work with we really have um they all have the same passion and the same common theme\nThey they want to add value to what they do for people they don't want to just be you're okay I I gave you a Medicare supplement I don't want to see a game for the next ten years we want these people to be our clients we want a relationship with them\nWe all have that same feeling and because of that we work very well together\nYou know maybe a a word is and and the two places that you were in ... where people can go to\nYes so Farmington um we're right on the water side Dr write off for a real sex um they can come to our office there we can go to their home they can if they live by the shoreline that area we can go to our shelling office mate with them there I'm so wherever it is can\nBe that's a wonderful thing you can go to\nTheir home we can go to their home and ... it's easier for people to review their prescriptions while they're in the home and they describe the prescriptions um some some grab a basket of prescriptions and so I may have one or none [laughter] but it's easier for them\nWhatever is convenient for a paper but we do some people some of our agents will me at the library\nA senior centers um we've had people in the McDonald's or Dunkin' Donuts for ever people feel comfortable about it I'm sure they're being cautious\nWells you know though is seriously or a Maggie and I as I said I've known him for Twenty years and uh uh you're the same today is you were there and and uh it was always that you care for people and then what I you know\nI got you got married and I met your husband he uh he came on and it's a it's it's it's quite a quite a team and I met some of the folks at the work\nYet if you've had some of them come into office says yo and you know just very passionate people about what we do\nUm and we do so much like it's not just the Medicare so we are their overall plan or in that we help them with their property and casualty we help them with their life insurance or long term care it's ah in their financial so it's we are there one person that they can go to ... stay with\nAnd uh the number take this down my friends I'm sure you've got it eight\nSix zero six or seven six zero two six zero okay eight six zero six seven six zero two six zero you call that number and they will send you the information send you the information I was talking about\nSeven six zero two six zero you call that number and they will send you the information send you the information I was talking about they have a nice little pamphlet that just chock full of everything and they'll uh they'll send it to somebody calls you huh\nWell send it right out [laughter]\nBut uh again ah it's it's you know it again in a when you have\nA company like this and you'll meet so many people and they make them your make them feel like they're part of it wrapped in that's that's a wonderful thing because ah you know today it's not easy now there are a lot of people out there that are not like you and your husband\nRight and there are programs out there like the Medicare savings program that people are not sure that what it is number one or that they can qualify for it and we help them with that too um we always make sure people are aware of the program and whether or not they would be able to qualify for it\nUm we saved people out just save somebody else housing dollars a month by getting them on the Medicare savings program and into the right coverage\nThat's fabulous so I was in a month ... oh my God well you would do that that's that's how you are\nAnd that's out or your husband is and that's why you're successful it's a great company

going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up as a yesterday\nAnd the media that their ... response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle once again [noise] [noise]\nYeah well I mean that's to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume is is that he\nIs interpreting a clause within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists or fallen students are illegal aliens that phrase\nA it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase\nIs ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it\nThere's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue for the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue it's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nAre um are or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to have a constitutional amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even started\nIs for the president to do this issue an executive order and what it'll mean is that\nThe state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue Raphael you will find one of them they'll sue and then there'll be a lawsuit that's this is\nUm you know whenever you think about this Fisher ... whatever you think the policy should be ... this is the smart way to ski up the issue so we can move it along\nIn the process of you know public debate because all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteenth sixty eight meant X and somebody says no this other senator and Eighteen sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the president\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels of Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid with a passport and your golden eh your gold\nAnd get as as a kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reason they're people from Korea\nPassport deacon go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower wage that's one of the reason they're people from Korea and turkey who do this as a way of um helping their kids dodged the draft\nOnce they get older because they can just talk on the plane and go to the United states and then they don't have ... ... it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time and your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf ah you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nUh it's it's fascinating we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break

of making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at each other's or what do we do about it we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then a bit of pushback and we're just not going to be intimidated by some ... ah you know drop things in the mail and hides so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back in stand up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district in which you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump one by one percent\nOf the media and the left the resistance are geared up their jacked up to try to uh run the tables and congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a meaty a conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up ... and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers to be getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more on affordable\nWith every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here jacket up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's a message or measures let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction we're drawing and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nTaxes around here and then the blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and its support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both uh lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduate and back in two thousand\nAnd that which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both uh lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduate and back in two thousand uh went to that now that it's a it's an it's an okay school Harvard law school but not as good as where I went in Virginia thank you very much a but a ...\nYeah I think there are in my field hockey that's all I can say I'm so J what you're

January and the seat is too important\nTo not get involved a joy ahead and\nI decided that uh we're not going to sit on the sidelines\nOr in a year's critical as this and come November six come next Tuesday we're not going to watch the returns come in and not know that we didn't do everything we possibly could for our country to expand opportunity and continue to grow this economy keep us safe\nAbroad and reform those immigration policies you've been talking about so uh we were we went all in because the country's worst than ... people have been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and all and that's what we're going to do\nA when you look at the national debate and a and the Democrats have funneled millions and millions of dollars into voter outreach registration getting people to the polls\nHave you gotten the assistance that you need a from Republicans and they are and see and others to do the same for the Republican side\nThey are and see the at our see see the White House they've all been supportive of the president has\nEndorsed be in a fundraiser for me vice president Pence has helped me twice\nA Speaker Ryan has been in to do a rally you're always a would welcome more help 'em but they've been helpful they they know the seat is important and frankly

hand picked\nCandidates this year uh they're dumping a lot of money and against us but uh it's a good district in good people around here who know\nWhich way they want to take the country that is lower taxes and the end\nAs well that yeah this is yours if people hear about New Jersey and and and it's it's always a butter the jokes are in in New Jersey a beautiful state\nIs there is so much

that there are serious wide open loopholes in our immigration law and these aliens are well coached and they know that if you say the magic word you're given a ticket in\n... well the fact of the matter is uh Mexico has confirmed Mexican official speaking to me last week confirmed that there were a Honduran left wing politicians one of them was removed from the caravan along with a couple of other associates or who is an opposition leader\nWas actually working in concert with Venezuelan a bullet politicians and getting help and comfort from groups within the United states who also have

be protected because there's strength and numbers\nBeing a part of a caravan does not give these special right\nUm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow a large group an authorized ... ... migrants to enter the U.S an unsafe for unlawful manner\nWe've already seen these sports they break immigration laws in Mexico and Guatemala date employed violent and dangerous

already a at homeland security with the\nChance that the president was referencing yesterday that there you're going to announce started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does as they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens throughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit ... worked out Laura\nI mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase in family unit apprehensions and the last five years we're I record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what\nThat says if you have a child with you we have to release you went to the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before\n... we're not able to detain them and ... immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there is not much we can do and the way of deterrent to immediately apprehend and repatriate which ... which is border security\nWhere if there was children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a that's a pretty decent percentage on record\nLow of mail um of adult apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were this low in terms of adult apprehension so that you're able to deliver a consequence\nKnow migration pattern changed when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty [noise] you know illegal aliens they they know they know where you are a lot better than members of Congress to\nA this was Terry McAuliffe course a good friend of the Clintons former governor of Virginia speaking about the uh the use I mean current governor again Virginia speaking about the use of the military let's do some\nGood or a thousand miles away their goal in three miles an hour isn't this several weeks and by the time they did it and he was the point he did as the show today to deploy the army donor what a disgrace this man has no politicized the military and his use or military for political purposes it's wall of a sudden the Marines today\nI can tell you as parents of children who are wearing the cost of our country to protect our country\nPresident should not politicize\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours and I are Katie uh you you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\nYou know all I just say is this president didn't create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America\nBut I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States [noise] as a large group just because you were in that group is president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended and that's what he's done [noise]\nAnd the homeland security department people you know think about you know border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice as part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct absolutely\nIt out so we got the left wants to abolish ice on despite all the great work ice does with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work in deporting a dangerous people from the United states\nUm but I think people don't really quite comprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration their their victims or economic victims\nThere the effect on public schools effect on our healthcare system\nHow closely is homeland security working with other agencies on the effects on American society of math illegal immigration\nThe secretaries

have the resources they need to handle the influx\nAt customs and border protection to meet with local sheriff local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units that they see at the border\nYou know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nAnd I think people forget that every time you you see the illegal immigrants dropped off at bus depots or even flown around you know the the when the and the kids are kids are coming unaccompanied their place where they quote sponsor sponsor sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants\nThat costs money it doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say somebody has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied children in a church has custody right now they cost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually wow\nJust that just the people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars each\nIllegal immigrant the United states annually to the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it costs for me to go to college ...\nOh my gosh this is Brock Obama just a few days ago on the uh mid

your data for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on a bit ahead on retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids held how old are your kids\nYou know they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million little your head congratulations ...\nSo what's your household income ... as an only child that way I can make yeah we we are I mean when you have one without million dollars you're millionaire yeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now\nAs well what do you plan for brown to how much cash how much twenty thousand a year her kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have to make two hundred I mean one eighty ... okay and if you\nCan cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's who that cash flow can be turned towards casual in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yeah All right\nSo I I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to invest and set aside and put Fifteen Percent of ... side\nSo we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college\nYou say ten grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that a front for from now until they go to school they'll have plenty of money I mean you just Jack up a five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine\nGet with one of those more investor pros and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area\nThe people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\n\nYou put Fifteen Percent into retirement into college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby steps seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty\nHouses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby steps seven to increase return rugby on Fifteen Percent\nAnd Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground so that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it\nI think you just got to sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids which point granted that's

from being or Christian\nAddress someone who's shocking up versus being married\nAnd ah you think that I'm just being overly Bible thumping or Christian or something like that that could be true I can be accused of those things and that's fine\nAnd be guilty guilty as charged a but why would that be why why would I bother and intersect your life on a personal level like that when you're going to ask me about something else because it's an economic\nProblem\nReally interesting article this week in the federalist federalist dot com the federalist dot com if you want to look up the article the article says the research proves the number one social justice imperative is\nMarriage or I\nDon't have time to go through the whole article but this is just really intriguing research\nSays just Seventy years ago social mobility and protection from poverty were largely a factor of employment those who had full time work of any kind were sold them poor fifty years ago education marked the Gulf separating the haves and the have nots\nFor the last Twenty years or more though marital status has increasingly become the central factor in whether our neighbors and their children rise above remain or descend into poverty the research is astounding\nIn Nineteen sixty the poorly and moderately educated we're only ten percent less likely to be married then the college educated with both numbers quite high eighty four Ninety four percent respectively that parity largely held until the late Nineteen seventies\nOr any of the sexual revolution by the way a professor Bill Galston president of Clinton's\nA President Clinton's domestic policy advisor and now he's senior fellow at Brookings explained that in the early Nineteen nineties that an American need only to do three things to avoid living in poverty graduate from high school marry before having a\nDay how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world [noise]\nWell I'm I'm preparing for the decorations and I'm I'm not quite sure what to do with my dad as they said they claimed my a student loan debt\nOkay a separate you from your husband or your draw haired\nYeah sorry about yes and my husband\nOkay and um\nSo uh you're preparing for separation how long have you on the merits\nOf about twenty two years\nOh my goodness it must be ... yeah\nIt it just that we are uh just not on the same page anymore I'm and I'm with other things but\nUm with money as well and it's just um there's just a thing I just I just don't want to go on with\nMhm have you been seeing a marriage counselor\n[noise] ah that's something he's not willing to do\nHave you gone you know okay\nDo that for you even if he won't go oh okay I think it will give you good I'm emotional information twenty two years in a long time and you need to\nHave somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some it maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well\nBut back to your original question I have a friend of mine the teacher's divorce recovery recovery after a divorce\nAnd um I remember many years ago hearing her say\nDivorced turns a marriage into a business transaction and so it it comes as a real quickly the emotions are car dolphins ... over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes very trends\nThe car dolphins set over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes I very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense yes and that\nAnd so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans they're going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nUh uh it it took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is\nIf this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything you can to save a twenty two year investment uh him with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year and you'd you'd look at your student loans how much to learn that if you got\nA better Kim I'm Sorry it out and oh my lord\nOkay well we let them know that this is going on hardship to furrow until you get past ah\nWhat else whatever else was going on here okay now do you own\nA home yeah what's it worth a ... was owed on it a hundred and Seventy thousand\nOkay so no equity either the amount to anything or is your car paid for\nYeah as his car by now okay is your name on that loan yeah good okay\nAre there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're the one that I have to let him I'm Sorry\nYou refused to let him you add it all better than that glass enclosed that account today just completely closed the credit card if he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [noise] period and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house\nI have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes in Mexico drip and puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance yeah good close okay\n... does your checking account have both names on it yeah okay so your money is separated by march\nIs there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I don't accept your mortgage probably as both are names on okay\nSo here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south you can't stay there you know I'm so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage\nOr sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb and people often do that in a divorce\nThey often do that but just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car\nYour checking account or already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt\nI'm it does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\nI'm not big now how much am I Am I Am a ten thousand\nMhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he has um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay not far away as well as his income uh it's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you are but in most states you could use some alimony after twenty two years and that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and are going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands [laughter]\nOkay no I'm not here\nSo I'm unless it's to skate no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest departments you can get you going to stay dead free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize the after the separation which will lead to divorce enlisted leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but you know care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength to negotiate in the divorce financially um and that's some\nAnd that put you in a position of strength to negotiate in the divorce financially\nI'm ... and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and\nWe're paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put 'em on heroin pay nothing right now but let's get the other side of the ... but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools\nTo get by by wake up call maybe the two you sit down with a coach a counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I ... that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or a draft and I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but I'm just that I don't address some ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with it can walk me through\nUm\nFor the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um because he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor that's really experienced in wise and a godly council a or help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining us\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money\nInteresting data that just came out on the article I read on the air about marriage\nAnd um [noise] the men who are married and make

ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nExactly and I mean sweet but dumb well you know right yeah I think\nBut I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and she grew back and a little bit better you know\nAnd to to you all the ... are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there because apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that\nTen percent on one of the keep the ringer now so and so just renting is not going to make or break your get out of that plan one way or the other\nBut this behavior will and this lack of being on the same page will so you know what let's just talk this through and and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together\nWhat to do with the ring and I don't know I I it just represents dumb and so\nI'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy is if I'm you are because it's just in violation of where are you thought your whole family was heading and it's like we just kind of you know it's you know you guys are just too old to do that kind of stuff\nSo I mean that's the twenty year old stuff rather\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Shay is with us in Fort Worth hey Shea how are you\nThe old stuff rather open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Shay is with us in four or ... how are you\nI'm good how are you there better than I deserve what's up\nI'm so I recently to cover you I got three only about three years ago I'm arguing Eubanks way are we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um\nThere were a bunch of life and try and all that went through our personal financial adviser had been advising my mother ever spent ban 'em and the question that I have\nAnd he put her in any ... about um five years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars and the annuity um and then the other end up on Peter and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there\nUm but the question is the annuity real recently we've had a five year mark and er here advising her to pull the money I turn into an which I think is a good idea however the question is is that she should have should have had\nThat money impacted initially at the beginning of the ah term you know and going up and he put in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the the drawn anybody at all you know and he knew that the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right that makes me question other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you I'm but I I I I Am I personally would have put all of it into good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent Carter paid off she has the road that\nYou wrote good good okay and how much is investments total does three hundred plus\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the embarrassment to the house another ... to ... you know I'm really honored their\nOld is she\nUh she thinks she just turned sixty okay ... when she then great out she's not like an an old ... year old ... on our way out I think right out\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven they're usually that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out that I either a\nAnyway or at least ... to my knowledge anyway so yeah I'm probably gonna question all of that I mean it's um it's not it's not like you put her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean that just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it\nAnd if it was a variable annuity and the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nUh they're okay um\nBut it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her then if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you'd have the right to ask a question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he bows up on you and\nStarts having an attitude and that's when you know it was founded moving into anyway\nSo you do that with any

there in the heat and the cold and rainy those gals I mean they're running up and down and I'm going to run up and down as wind up in there as somebody waiting you're talking about how it's been since

you know\nOn the trip was a button again there we go to mark how are you [noise]\nI'm foreigners do better than I deserve what's up\nWell the reason I'm calling because they've been talking about bankruptcy so my wife and I are combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that\nAnd today it's the talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I\nCombined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm a hundred thousand a student loan and the violence would be a credit card debt we recently met with a financial advisor\nAnd they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because it would take a long time\nTo pay off the bat they said that the saying that it would be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion what is your household income sure a combined it for about eighty five okay you have any car debt\n... ... um no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth\nUm I Would say about twenty thousand combined\nOkay All right\nWell here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor to know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nHere we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was just thinking entirely because of the amount of credit card that we have\nFive like our ability and really have a light a match wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollars where the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand that's absurd dude\nThat's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd 'cause the ... the the hundred thousand dollars in student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless it doesn't it's not bankrupt ... so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy I'm thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nIn a near\nYeah one year live on safety paid off in one year take six extra jobs shelves so much stuff you can't breathe you know eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nA call the work world Tony okay each\nUm her to a newer model the owners of five hours or who are hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand minor was about seven mhm\nOkay well um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked\nWith families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those if you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to dead young lazy to address the situation\nLet's say even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year and your debt free other than your student loan which\nI'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card data big on that one year so how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan\nPay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything\nAnd um you know I I Would not move down in car initially out of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the pastor\nOkay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\n\nUm you know if he does wetter but that's about it\nGun or does she do speaking I mean I mean he says she speak on Sunday mornings\nYes he does very well be designed to okay All right\nUm and I wonder if if you know she might sell do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know\nI mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation of income and you guys tightened down your budget to nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing and for years\nMaybe three but four for sure uh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation\nYears maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm\nSorry that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you got to stop living the way you been living goes is not working agreed\nOn despair is that makes sense yeah something like that\nYou know the Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time but it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not ... they're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my lab dude\nA with money in particular as high end up teaching is 'cause I got a PHD and do you and be but um you know I don't\nKnow who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nAs they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you could not only can work through this I think you

good to go full time entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur dig running [noise] yeah\nThat's what my wife does she sells the clothing for that little row um and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement and benefits and security\nView we believe was her the mechanics thing\nTo sell women's clothing yes or ...\nAre you already involved in the business\nYes she's been selling it for a year and a half um she's she's killing it she she makes in one week would I make a gross in a month as a mechanic mhm um so I wouldn't be going fulltime helping her with envoys singing shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses skirts\n... and ... and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff would that be the the best route to go as low as ... percent okay you walk away from fifty in order to lose a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat comes out of these short\nWell she she grows says she's gross two hundred ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what your groceries okay unless you're going to add\nMore to her business in savings okay\nOr in revenue than what you are making now\nThen it's not making sense okay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and ten no yeah the ... she's got costs of goods sold out of that

because I was a white male that's what I said\nOkay yes okay but whatever it was it was um the affirmative action okay\nYes it was affirmative action that they shafted me with yes\nSo that was social

called is slowing down on its own momentum it's running out of steam a lot of the people are just going home for a number of reasons and it's ... mainly because we have a president\nTo his credit who is willing to stand up and say enough is enough was sending the military to the border we sent the national guard to the border and that's it you're not coming in forget about it you just not getting any here that's what he was elected to do for that reason alone\nDonald Trump is doing a great job I mean let's be clear here again it's easy to say he's not doing everything right but given the the opposition here it's lucky still in the in the position that he said\n[noise]\nThat staff so apparently they're not going to get through this country so he's into this country so easily\nAnd the rodeo that was expected around our polling places may not be conducted as the left wants so they're slowing down and apparently they're being turned back some of going back on their own that's the good news\nAnd uh let's see what else was going on the uh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh dj shortly\nAnd the left wing anti American creeps had the nerve\nTo make believe that those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the arc group funded by Alexander Soros no less speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism\nBecause when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be defined\nYou anti Americans on the left you make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't\nThere are many many conservative Jewish people will never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you stir up anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray to God these left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros just cooler today and don't make a mockery of yourselves and pretend that you speak for the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying they're not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead\nAnd don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president then against most Americans by the way\nJust given a break for a day can you do that survivors huddle huddled in closets during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like ours over we're not caught a notion well you would like not to be that kind of nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learned it can't just be done with love they learn to have to tolerate in one hand and it was the in the other that's why they develop the regime some machine gun\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand so that she rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that story would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant and\nThat of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in America comes to understand that someone else is not going to defend you you have to defend yourself maybe they wouldn't have to huddle in a closet maybe they could learn\nThat they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it then they have to hire armed guards I've been trying to warn people about this was Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said just throwing the dice sitting there like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and voted them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came and went this one hit home because it was a white man who did it a craze Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda\nThey've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews they didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean is there is the uh the the the slaughter in the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other slaughters they just always looked the other way because it doesn't fit the left wing agenda is that clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these news stories and you take them to do it for a living is very difficult\nI had a tough time over the weekend after this happened that hit me very close and very hard and I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about\nSomething that's entirely different\nWhich is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children and then the caravan of which we know there were several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you're a gangster how would you come into the country you hide or would you walk in Santa gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou're getting the line with the thousands of them with the women and children you're having to push the carriages in front of you\nAnd you get the sympathy of the American people is oh they're all just wanting to come and they're all poor that's how you would do it so it's slowing down on its own momentum as was slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not notice\nForget the liars in the media who do this through incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals\nDo not want open borders they do not this is a a a small percentage of radical fanatics\nFunded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not a lot of mentioned his name anymore suddenly as a victim all of a sudden after victimizing America for all these years with all of his money suddenly he's the victim\nHe funds let's see on the far east funded black lives matter is fun to occupy groups to me that's not American by the way that's quite something else\nAnd he was thrown out of Hungary he's not welcome in many European countries all George Soros because they try to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian our loves their own country as a Nazi according to who George Soros they throw them out of out of Hungary for what he tried to do to that country\nThey closes universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether over the airwaves\nIt's about so called white nationalists that's the new bogeyman white nationalist\nJust say why the nationalist together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right if you live in a liberal community has since I was white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist togethers feels good when you say it doesn't it what is it white nationalist\nIt's not too broad a statement white nationalist so if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty what you're a Nazi now so look at every cross in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war\nShe a lot of them were white most of them are white and the cemeteries as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just relation wasn't as and the military was comprised largely of white people and were let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them are fighting the ... he loved America not all but many war\nAnd so they fought why well they will nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German that simple so why they're white nationalist too so you know to find your terms a little clearer\nWhat I mean white nationalist what is it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms into having you say\nNot every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms into having you so you could believe that anyone who is crowded the flag proud of the nation's history proud of the culture proud of the language is somehow a bad person I think\nVery carefully before your smear white with that

I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought I was the only one China ...\nTwice so let me go and this has started a huge firestorm today\nOr you know we're in a y stand on birthright citizenship do I like a anchor babies per se I Want to get into that I Want to stand on what will happen most likely if the Supreme Court and some more details and your calls coming out this next year oh oh\n\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call the airbags in their vehicles\nAnd\nYou also have subject to the jurisdiction there of ... and\nThe difference between a born\nOr naturalized in the United states you know is that up to a you know the legal debate now my personal opinion of course it is it would absolutely be open to interpretation by dies much or\nMore versed in\nIn in a constitutional law than I Am a I I mean it'd be a fun fight to watch here but the question is is the president is Trump going to go down this road and open up this can of worms now I've always felt that I've had a problem with anchor babies for instance\nThat are illegals or make it across the border into this country and they they drop a child here an anchor baby then to have citizenship for ah their child or children I I've got a problem that I'm not a fundamental problem with that I don't like it I think it is wrong\nOr to come here for the express reason of drop and anchor and and in many cases coming to the country illegally and dropping that anchor baby I don't like it I never liked but does it mean that the the fourteenth amendment should change I I I just don't think it's going to happen\nI've never been comfortable with the whole\nPremise of just automatic citizenship if you're born in the United states but there is legal precedent that I understand probably should not change even if I don't agree with the premise so where do you stay with you like to see the fourteenth amendment repealed\nWould you like to see a a constitutional challenge to the Supreme Court before that though would you like to see President Trump issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship which again would be immediately\nA throw it up the chain in the in the federal court system you know a federal court of appeal and this and this and then of course it would be a Supreme Court case or if if the White House decided to take that for\nYou know they get always withdraw their executive order\nBut they would lose this let's be very clear the White House would lose this that there's no doubt about eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide never had any feel amount of anchor babies\nThe the thing the president ought to issue the executive order\nEven knowing that it would probably be shot down by the Supreme Court including\nMany of and maybe even the appointees of Trump on the conservative side of the court eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on a yeah I've got some more little bits and pieces I Want to get into what I Want to go to phones are pretty quickly here while we have a time left in the hour let's grab Scott up first today in Las Vegas Nevada Scott Iran ... welcome to the program L O\nEight or nine long I Love your show man thank you very much\nSort of or treat demand might go back to trying to solve the problem with the Dred Scott goes into an read that in order to minute talk about the journey fiction an object of during the day illegal alien by definition are not subjected to our jurisdiction there or the mortgage amendment\nDoes not apply to people that are here illegally and you go back to certain cases that were I think there was a case of a tiny a legal alien that have been here through Ellis Island in your what being deprived of it is right you don't get and went up to\nThe Supreme Court that he is completely subject by the end it because he is here legally and an all out of the day here and\n... is offering work and that are legal ... but that doesn't apply to illegal aliens or not\n... with that with that case with that case you might be talking about the United states the ... a long Kim aren't from eighty to eighty Ninety eight case is that does that sound familiar to you and that\nYeah so Eighteen Ninety eight it was ah the United states the\nAh won him aren't that was a big case I was reading about that earlier so I'm Glad you brought up by a a credit goes to uh the article I was reading came from law and crime and they also pointed out a flyer versus do\nA credit goes to the article I was reading came from law and crime and they also pointed out a flyer versus do from Nineteen eighty two and then Nineteen eighty five you had the INS the Rio's Panetta\nSo we do have you know some of these cases uh as far as birthright being upheld\nAnd as far as one has already been decided by the Supreme Court if in fact the president Scott decided to go to the executive order out there is no doubt in my mind that this would be shot down that this would would would not survive a Supreme Court challenge\nAnd you know the question is you know the president\nOr ... ... and the president is obviously being counseled or he's had discussions at the White House level and a White House legal counsel level level and I'm I'm sort of doubting here\nThat that\nTrump's White house legal counsel gave him a green light and didn't give him all of the speed bumps and pitfalls\nAlong the way they just you know in the accidents interview and again I played it before the break I'll play another chunk a chunk here again because I think it's important for the audience to just joined us here but Trump did say that he ran this by his legal team\nAnd that's where he said that you don't need a constitutional amendment that an executive order would suffice and I just can't believe that his legal team\nA council him and said yeah you're going to win this fight go ahead and the issue an executive order and we're going to win this or at the Supreme Court I got to believe that if this was a discussion among President Trump's legal team that they flat\nOut told him that you weren't going to lose there's a at\nThe Supreme Court level you're gonna lose it up the chain of the federal law you know if it goes to a federal appeals court in D.C and then up to the Supreme Court he's going to lose it every step of the way uh even when the so called conservative a appointees or presidents are that were Republicans that are that\nAre appointed a more conservative judges Scott thanks for the call I appreciate it let me play the audio one more time of year again this is from act\nCEOs on HBO talking about birthright citizenship\nSome legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution waking executive order exactly right or have you thought about that is the only law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member\nCastle and then you don't you know number one number one you don't need that number ... lessons well and you can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits tree they kill us is ridiculous and it has to end um have you talked about that with counsel young\nI have wearing the price that is in the process it will happen is that what you're talking about really has a very interesting because I didn't\nKnow the president's saying that it's going to happen he says the executive order will happen\nWill it I mean he has to know and he must have been council that if he does issue the executive order is going to be many legal challenges ... legally challenge and it's probably going to lose and be found unconstitutional the Supreme Court is the president going to go down that road\nThat is the big question\nI Would I like to see the battle you know it might be someone using but you know also [laughter]\nIt's you know and that would be pretty tough mulch ooh is
