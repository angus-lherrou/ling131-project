witnesses to corroborate each one of the names were given the story it can't get straight a and then you have\nAgain the Keith Ellison case and the latest that I saw yesterday and I had to dig up\nThe story from the Minneapolis Star Tribune is that\nThe Minneapolis police are are not going to investigate yeah that sounds the deer parties attempt to and this again this was a published or\nWhat time this was last night so this is published last night the DFL party attempt to find a law enforcement agency willing to investigate a domestic abuse claim against us representative Keith Ellison was mired in uncertainty Wednesday after\nThe Minneapolis police department said it would seek to refer the case to other jurisdictions a\nEllis who is former girlfriend Catherine Monaghan alleges that the Democratic candidate for attorney general in Minnesota tried to drag her off a bed during a fight in August twenty sixteen Ellison denies it\nAnd I tried to drag her off a bed during a fight in August of twenty sixteen Allison denies\nAgain look look at what's going on I realized Supreme Court versus you know he was almost didn't leaving Congress wanting to become the attorney general for a

over twenty trend dollars what happens next rising inflation drops the dollar sign some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren will you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA for us too precious metals\nSo up right here less and less so this is just out this afternoon\nFrom the Weekly Standard how Jeff Flake one week to lay helped clear Brett Kavanaugh's\nName so there's just published from the Weekly Standard says the same damn thing I've been saying\nWhen Arizona Republican Senator Jeff flake insisted on an additional one way to lay of the cabinet confirmation vote in order to allow the FBI to conduct a supplemental background check investigation into allegations of sexual assault many Republicans feel that it would accomplish nothing other than provide time for more people\nTo smear Kavanaugh with new false allegations\nAnd listen that certainly was a possibility punt what other plane did you have this was the Hail Mary and I said folks that flake could be the one to save Kavanaugh and ... this was the best possible sucked\nYou want to just wrong with me and play the martyr game and oh my God they're out to get an order you want to see Kavanaugh's confirmed or at least have the best possible damn shot a confirmation\n\nAnd again the FBI investigation nothing new here nothing new it's been turned up there's no corroboration of these stories\nAfter not for but it turns out nine were interviewed and of course the Democrats are there still on a happy they wouldn't be unhappy with one ever they're not\nHappy with the kind of thought that was used on the final report door once they're not happy with the type of a copy machine paper that was used maybe the Brighton those dumb levels not high enough for them\nOr whatever the Republicans say do or walk the Democrats come clean polar opposite that's the way Washington is happening these days\nAnd it is a complete polar opposite it ended up the the the polarization is just it's just the worst it's ever been out there is no doubt about I mean Schumer's complaining about one company for a hundred senators\nNow as we mentioned earlier that you know this or not\nApparently goes back to some Senate rules are laws or during a I think it was ... he and Obama agree to that\nIn two thousand nine that on these types of issues that they'd be one copy and then the the private review and I said flat out that I that I Wish they would be revised or if there was some type of the damned them that they should have been more than one copy for such a thousand pages\nAnd both sides of the aisle Democrats or Republicans are trying to see this document if there's one copy he got a thousand pages and\nThey all have to go to the skiff they all have to go to the sensitive compartment that information facility in the Senate building which is a secure room no electronic devices allowed no notes can be taken\nOut of the secure room with this one copy in the Senate vote they they should have had multiple figured out a way how to change things if Obama and Patrick Leahy were behind this with one copy back from two thousand they should figure a way how to fix up [noise] because I\nI think it's important for both sides to get this thing and read it as quickly as they possibly can pay some of the senators apparently not going to be able to see it until late tomorrow\nOr tomorrow afternoon to discuss the slots to see it are filling up\nIs this long document\nEight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of course ah Schumer and Dianne Feinstein they held the pressure\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of course a\nSchumer and Dianne Feinstein they held the press it took no questions earlier complaining that the FBI report or did not interview Kavanaugh\nDid not interview ... Ford and then other people were interviewed Ramirez this lawyer the second accuser says that ah corroborating witnesses were not interview that\nThat's their claim Dianne Feinstein complaining that it looks like an incomplete investigation I'm going to say whatever the opposite is\nAnd then it was limited by the White House and then many docs were not allowed to be viewed in the White House tied the FBI's hands where does he have Susan Collins the moderate Republican from Maine she says\nThe the FBI investigation appears very thorough and Jeff Flake has come out today saying no additional corroborating information\nHas emerged from this FBI investigation\nTo who got the ... of course he got a hundred senators but a hundred and nine can see it a hundred nine only a hundred and set of civil else gets to see if we get a committee members you got one clerk so that gets you one oh nine or to get to see this thing [noise]\nAh oh and they can't talk about\nAnything was death to his city so even if\nThey're him a secure room they don't take notes they don't have a copy it so the centers that see it and come out when they talk to the media or whomever they can't talk about the findings with any specificity is for a specific details and then\nI have you saw is now we've got this this link need a list of a law professors that they want they\nWant a the Kavanaugh are not confirmed because of his ... he oh so what ... I got to find my story I I\nCan go by memory I have a million stories floating around here let me see if we can find a law professor story if not I'll go by my my memory but you've got this letter that was signed that I'm looking for that I Am a campfire around there some but he got a whole litany I think it was a hundred law professors are here it is I found that by looking at\nHundreds of law professors co signed a letter saying the Kavanaugh should not be confirmed\nAnd it comes down to a it was a hundred now I guess it's up to over six hundred and fifty law professors signing this letter given to the U.S Senate say they can or should not be confirmed\nA this was the letter that was published by the New York times we've had a more lawyers apparently sign on to this\nI Am so the signatories are being updated because more law professor deciding on and their point their position was the cabinet is not display the temperament and needed to assume a place on the Supreme Court based on his actions\nThat they're hearing last Thursday see either as bogus ... how about looking at\nHis behavior look at his temperament for years on the bench of a federal court how\nAbout that how about his opinions wants three o seven how about the other uh cases that enjoying the majority on\nHow about that\nHow about the hearings that he's been a part of as a judge factors is the guy was emotional last week because he's being attacked and smeared his family's\nUnder as tacking under attack his wife is getting death threats his kids are just embarrassed and want to shrivel up and blow up I mean it's just unbelievable so he raises his voice oh I mean he's under attack\nI mean ... me it was the worst possible allegations and against emotional he raises his voice and he gets a little confrontational couple of times during the also that disqualifies him throw out all of his jurisprudence\nThrow out all of the cases all of his writings that his opinions\nAll the clerks that have dealt with him over the years his staff\nEven a Yale Law professor who originally or a liberal voting for Hillary Clinton said yep totally qualified through all that out\nPreposterous\nIt's kind of follows Joseph is in what Barry New York ...

there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin\nAnd that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to collaborate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the light you have forty nine Democrats who do not want to have a fist reliable conservative vote on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this\nBeyond the midterms so that\nThe Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and can defeat a cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat Merrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to try to impeach him but I I looked up to history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this uh for the weekend Lars\nBut there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on that are no longer\nThe kind of norms that you can absolutely bank on I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um that that we maintain the tradition that judges can't be a it can't be impeached unless they've engaged in some kind of a misconduct or use their offices abusive late but\nYou know there's all kinds of norms that we we've had that are no longer you know you had two or three generations of students who have been told that norms are\nBasically uh instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and deny their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been explained my audience and I think you're back me up on this and told me if I'm wrong that if they attempted to an eight member court it would've been fact I'd be effectively made a lot of the tightest\nDecisions of for foreign effectively and know it would've neutered the Supreme Court to a large extent but could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh and and by doing I Would still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\nI think he would because he would just put his head down and continue to do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him\nOn the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed\nIs so remote a ... as to be illusory that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrats got an ... majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would count for much\nUsually Andy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy put the blind shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left her shop dodging America and here's a great example of it but let me ask you a political question\nDo you think that the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today that it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout to Senator John Cornyn drought today do you think that Americans average\nAmericans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes this full\nWell I think Laura is if you look at as I understand it if you look at for example the polling that we're all looking so carefully at\nOf the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively or trying to hang on what we're seeing is that\nThere's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power and in this case the the left with Trump and has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of of voting against Trump or sending a message\nWith Trump and has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of\nVoting against Trump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh\nWhat they've done is awake and they usually more than\nA party in power for the midterms in mid term elections all all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on they people looking at this and they're frightened by it\nWell and that means that they miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do it named to charge where Dr Ford's name has\nCome out Christine Ford and that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was an even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweat Nick which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got all kinds of of other baggage she brings weather and then as they did that\nThey started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that\nTurn off Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp has come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just not it might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for most people even if they thought that she was long\nWar of the mind at least credit her good faith that you know was sincere or even if she was ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous people now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it turned\nThis whole idea of advice and consent into search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life\nDestroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly be frightened by that\nFunny all those Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was used\nInappropriately genetic trend or a real a real creep and Bill Clinton or where you'll rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women and\nAt that time they said oh you can engage in the politics of personal destruction I guess unless it it benefits your side and I hope Republicans see all this and say we're never going to behave this way no matter how much of my cost us so we will not do it I I I for the most part I don't think they will Andy things are in size we always valued them\nWhat was that again for Donald Trump needed the votes today the Senate confirmation from moderate Republican so he was forced to do that until\nWell But Jerry what more did the you know I Know that what more do the FBI I Need to as Dr ...\n... where you can ask a follow up question the question\nIs in time what you don't want to know the limitation\nYou could

answer short\nShe was asked Dan where this happened she doesn't know where it happened do you know when it happened or even what era to happen and he's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and Senate best aging in and said ask\nHer again you know where this happened or any answer would change\nThe actually going for ... and then that how do you are now eighty two it didn't

to find signs in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened and Jerry you realize how ridiculous is is to say if only the FBI had asked that question four or five ...\nThere's a Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened a jury you realize how ridiculous is is to say you've only the FBI had asked that question for five more times her answer might

Center for legal in judicial studies that heritage drinks and good to have you back on the program\nThanks for having me so did the police need the ability\nTo be able either shoot down or bring down drones if they end up being used not just by terrorists but by ordinary criminals as well\nAnd the answer that question is absolutely yes uh you know we're on the pulse of really I think a revolution\nAnd what Germans are going to be able to do in terms of productive and positive things for society we're talking about engaging in life saving activities that can bring a emergency medical equipment to the scene of an accident minutes or helping to find someone who was lost in a community\nNeither uses the drones are being at the two right now and I think we're going to see a lot of that but we also see that uh you know as with any new technology there is also a potential for misuse end abuse and there have certainly been a fair number of cases in just the last few months\nWhere drones are being put to watch a novel criminal or or even terrorists purposes\nAnd law enforcement uh unfortunately does not have presently the ability to do much if anything to stop the\nGenes in before we go to the ability to bring him down can you give us a couple of examples about ... have been using them\nShore so really what we're seeing is that criminals are at least this innovative when it comes to to finding new uses for drugs as ... innovators of the commercial side\nUh we've we've looked at some of the instances at a at heritage when we were doing research on this and I was quite frankly floored by by how ... used we've seen cases where\nA a you know common burglars are using drones to add to case houses before they break in\nWe've seen instances where drones are being used essentially to serve as a if you will of criminal Airforce actually surveilling the law enforcement personnel who are attempting to us Surveillance Act\nAgainst organized crime or and then of course in just last couple of months we've seen how drones can be used it in a terrorist attempt a when you look at the Venezuela instincts are into that excuse me a where allegedly there was an assassination attempt on the president of Venezuela and it was too drones armed with explosives that\nWe're going to be the instruments for that stuff nation of taps\nSo really it runs it runs the gamut but then they're also just cases where people are flying a ... or recklessly and there are a number of instances where drones have been observed in the flight lines at airports and in fact you can go on YouTube you see a really impressive but clearly dangerous videos are drones\nJust a few feet above all men jetliner coming in for a landing\nI'm trying to remember I thought I'd heard about that maybe it was just one those somebody imagining what they could be used for but you know that\nGetting contraband inside of prisons has been a big business has literally couldn't amount\nTo millions of dollars whether it's drugs or weapons or those kinds of things and I'm Wondering whether people I've ever tried to use that I Can't remember a specific example where that's been done but I Would love to give the authorities the ability to bring drones like that down\nIf they see one flying over in dropping contraband inside the walls\nThere right that's a very real problem and in fact\nDrones like that down if they see one flying over in dropping contraband inside the walls\nThe right that's a very real problem and in fact there there are some specific examples that come to mind or just a thing as has happened in a a correctional facility in Ohio for example\nA a drone was used to smuggle contraband into the prison there apparently it was a accidently drop in the wrong location it wound up in the hands of the wrong a prison gang within the prison walls and sparked a Seventy five and may ball or in another instance\nA prisoner was able to use tools that appear to have been smuggled in by drawing to escape and they have excellent security prison or and then at the southern border uh not not a prison context but we see what our would have been dubbed Marco drugs\nThat are being used to ferry drugs from Mexico into the United states over the head of a border patrol agents who are just unfortunately powerless to do much beyond tracking those drones to actually interdict\nSo in case like that we should we have ... if we don't already have from the military the ability to electronically knock these things out of the year should we allow law enforcement the latitude to shoot them out of the year if necessary\nYes what we're talking about now is how to empower law enforcement agencies\nTo engage in what's known as countered drone uh operations and counter drone operations there they they run the gamut from a you know nearly using what's known as an unmanned traffic management systems simply air traffic\nControl for drones to restrict access to particular areas I'm so that drunk and not fly into the airspace above the Superbowl or near an airport all the way to kinetic devices like a isn't just a plain old firearm to shoot down of drone there are a lot of open questions about\nExactly what the order of operations will be if you will in terms of identifying drones that are posing a threat to public safety\nWarning the operator and then what sort of tools or techniques will be able to properly engage those because as you might imagine if you're dealing with a\nA true terrorist and spent the last thing I think you'd want to do is shoot down a drone which might be carrying an explosive device because then of course you create a hazard to the people on the ground\nBut what we have right now is federal legislation that has just been sent to the White House the FAA reauthorization that will for the first time and power federal law enforcement to engage in kind of John activities which to date had been barred\nWell and he was one of the big problems with the fact that these things are largely made of plastic they're not made out of ... models which means that it's going to be tough to spot them unless you can spot them visually and since they're small they're not easy to spot visually from from any kind of distance\nThat's one of the problems or is it actually being able to detect a drone at any reasonable distance because even though these fly at a considerably slower speed typically than manned aircraft are they still fly pretty fast and so you have to be able to ideas and several miles away from a potential target so that you can add\nAny reasonable amount of time\nTo be able to do the threat assessment to identify the drone and the trigger any counter measures and so that is certainly one of the challenges that being said uh you know ... the the mother of invention and there are a fair number of private sector companies right now that are developing and bringing to market exactly\nThese sorts of technologies and we're we're looking at optical cameras were looking at a at radar and you know other people are looking actually at a a audio equipment they can actually detect the buzzing sound of drugs\nAnd then you have to be able to identify what kind of drone trace the signals uh to the extent that it's not an automated drunk so that you can identify the individual user\nThese are all challenges that will need to be a that would need to be dealt with and resolved in the near future\nYou know drinks in a few ... about Thirty years ago it was on board a a coast guard airplane were just shooting a story for television about how they did search and rescue and they got a call up to trace the guy they thought was running drugs it turns out he was\nAnd he was in a twin engine aircraft which is a pretty good size aircraft and they gave chase and the guy knew they were chasing him and we were in a ...\nA slower speed ... all the same of falcon and this guy kept dropping down below us and then would try to turn the other direction and I asked the pilots afterwards I said at what point do you lose sight of this guy if he manages\nTo go east when we're going west before we can turn around he said about four miles out it's really hard to see him and that's a full size aircraft\nAre taken down from full size to the size of a drone one big enough to carry it looks like a couple of pounds of explosive and all of a sudden your your ability to see them at any distance may go from four miles to you know half\nFor Obama's pending phone yeah I was also guidance documents notices memoranda circulars bulletin administrative interpretations all these other kinds\nOf agencies sub regulatory guidance that we've taken to calling regulatory dark matter that pours out it's not supposed to be binding however\nIf you disobey it you may not get your permit you may not get your waiver so there's a lot of bureaucratic pressure that come there but we recommended that the Trump do an executive order kind of like Reagan's executive order that requires the cost benefit analysis that we have now\nFor normal rules but the Trump address these guy to document 'cause he's pretty much picked the low hanging fruit as far as the two for one regulations right you would imagine that you know he's looked at it you know he did a congressional you got rid of Obama's midnight roles and then he's done some two for one\nOf what of all the uh the rules that are out there but you kind of you kind of run run to the end of that for the next day he should do I think is address guy that there's been a lot of the Olympic and dying at three in the bathroom ... guide and\nI was going as I was going to bring them or not yeah Wayne I only have like my audience manageable in fact that you know the rule that said the bathrooms\nIn both colleges in public schools had to be open so that a a biological boy who now claimed she's a girl can use the ladies' room and and that's that was deeply disturbing for a lot of people they said that any ride and yet it didn't come out of even a regulation and came out of a guy not a ...\nWell that just quickly the interesting thing on that laws as he got rid of that but he didn't count it didn't credit himself into two for one also the department of labor got rid of a role in front of a guidance on franchising Obama had didn't count credit himself for that\nThey got rid of rule on independent contracting that was going to cause additional regulatory burdens for up for independent contractors didn't count that in favor in his two for one process\nThere's other guy that you mentioned the FCC that you know there will be tremendous guidance coming out of the net neutrality rules that's being rolled back now\nYou also guidance to me is a sense they can sense the beer bureaucracy can regulate now without writing anything down I think it's important that Trump use if he could create an executive order the same kind of legacy and sticky power that Reagan's executive order on cost benefit analysis\nHas for guidance documents and I think after the pen and tone era that's an important thing to do especially if we you know they're going to have new elections were going to have Democratic president again we need to have something in place\nThat discloses makes transparent transparent and tries to make an effort to roll back the abuse of guidance documents or regular\nArcade Wayne let me do a deep dive just a little bit I mean into the wee bit and here's one I Want to know I can understand why the the regular regulation process is deliberately slow that is it takes a long time to adopt a rag\nBut once again it takes a long time to get rid of it and I understand that because it because anyone rag may have a big effect on industries on people on businesses and everything else you don't want to see um whipped side but I guess I Wonder as we've gone from a much slower age\nTo now an age where things change dramatically and they change very very fast\nDoes government need to have the ability to come up to speed quickly so when you see a problem\nAnd say this problem is exacerbated by this rule we need to get rid of this quickly\nThat there's that ability without putting people in it you know if you go out and say hey coal industry adult adult is I don't drink and then to you know six months later you know forget to take all the filtering back out or or any industry the banking industry you got to have everybody sign this for no forget about that don't do it I understand the whip saw fact\nBut is there a way to quickly respond when either the private sector or the government sees something that's a problem and they realized the only way to fix it and get rid of that rule oh I'm Sorry that's a very long involved process senator we won't be able to do that one can we do to balance those two names\nRight well as you know and as they say the constitution isn't perfect but it's better than what we have now yeah the problem we have with this administrative state is that you do have these unelected agencies that are making those rules and the first place\nWhat a lot of proposals are and there's legislation to do this in the house\nHas passed at that I I guess I guess go talk that regulation I Know the house\nHas done its job it's packed double regulatory reform those it's just the Senate in this environment you can't even begin to get anything for it but what you have to do is win or lose complicated or win or lose costly Congress needs to approve that rule that's the only thing that is going to be able to give the certainty\nThat ... that are the businesses need you know they often said there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty but sometimes just the certainty\nThese regulations\nAnd we were having a heck of a time for over a decade with these net neutrality rules so you've got to have is\nYou see these new regulations and we were having

front of America\nAnd for the last several weeks cabin on forward have been the big dominant topic but I thought we were talking about a few other important issues while we've got the time John Tammany is the director of the center for economic freedom and freedom works and author of the book the end of work John it's good to have you on the program again thanks\nA lot of great to be here thanks for having me on\nYou know the the Federal Reserve gets under people's skin and it gets under my skin as well and there have been times I've heard from people who say let's just get rid of all together and I've I've said well I'm not sure we need to get rid of it altogether but I mean it certainly should be reined in but is there a way that we can get by without a a bank of last\nResort in the form of the Federal Reserve\nBecause I'd love to get to a private sector solution to that\nOh yeah ... without question or the fed exists as a lender of last resort as you just put it but what can't be stressed enough is that it's unheard of\nFor a solvent bank ... ever go to the fed for alone because to do so is the mission of bankruptcy and what that means the federal leagues is\nTo loan to insolvent banks which is not what it's supposed to do so we don't need it for that the feds also bank regulator but if you're a bank regulator that usually means you couldn't get a job at a real bad\nAs we saw two thousand eight the fed was fed had no clue about the problems within banks and so it can't do a good job there\nAnd then it aims to target the overnight rate which banks lend to one another but you know and interest rates of price like any other you don't need to set for that so I think this notion that the fed serves some use or central purpose is easy to disapprove we could get rid of it and most wouldn't notice it at all\nIn fact I don't particularly like the fact that they regulate the interest rate though do you not that the federal government views them as a way to when the economy starts to heat up that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates artificially outside of market forces and say we need to cool it down\nAnd in theory there the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold that they come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially to try\nTheory there the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold then they come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially to try to pump it back\nUp again I don't like that either even though I'm I'm well aware of the positive effect that has for some people I think it's a terrible I Would rather have the price be like the price of gasoline or the price of oil or the price of any other commodity because really at the end of the day money's just another commodity isn't it\nOh yeah yeah absolutely and and what ... what should be stress there is the\nIs that the fed can't really alter the price of credit or why do we borrow money we borrow money because it can be exchanged for real resources like trucks tractors computers desk chairs buildings labor most specifically and so it's a reminder that we create the credit we create the resources the\nPeople are looking to borrow and they borrow money and and so this idea that the fed can just decree the cost of credit cheap\nIs as silly as the mayor of Portland saying okay the top of amount that you can charge for a apartment rentals in Portland is a hundred dollars a month\nOkay well demand for for those rentals would be high but supply would be non existent the fed can't decree resources cheap so I think even there we give the fed way too much credit this idea that it can eat up the economy and slow it down\nI don't take very seriously\nSo is there an and I don't either because\nYou know all the way through from away when the initial you know we fell off the edge of the cliff and all the way to June of nine when officially the recession was over I like to remind people of that because they want to credit Obama with fixing\nThe uh you know the the recession I say really\nYou fix it between January twenty up in the middle of June that's pretty amazing you didn't have time to do anything what did he do exactly\nAnd they say well you know you fix the economy or he didn't\nBut their idea was will drop the interest rates low enough to zero or or even below zero so that will pump the economy back up again clearly you didn't do over eight years what Trump is managed with regulatory reform and tax reform over just a couple of years\nSo I don't buy that one either wants the best way than to sort of back\nDown and start to dismantle this uh you know this role that the fed has if we can get the political will to do that and speak to that too if you don't mind\nWell you know let's let's hit on a couple of those things ... is that are crucial for one the recession was the sign of the recovery a recession it's merely signals and economy cleansing itself the misuse of labor or the bad\nHabits develop lousy companies the bad investments and so when you get out of the way of the recession you're setting the stage for the recovery and so that's the first thing I Would say a ... a president can't the best thing a president can do is just do nothing and then then you have\nYour recovery um in terms of dismantling the fed\nAgain I I think you just decide you prove why we don't need the fed\nCan't make credit inexpensive it can't push the the rate is zero and suddenly you think that that's resources out the friends that is going to say the resource ... is anyone thinks the fed can make that so\nNo no more no more than the fed could control the economy by saying well if things are bad let's drop the price of oil the ten bucks a barrel and then the economy will take off like a rocket because gas and diesel be cheap and that's where the economy runs on no they can\nDo and and so you nail it you hit it on the head so the fed could never say OK oil's going to be cheap now and oil and and make oil plentiful by saying that what the fed would do if it could [noise]\n[noise] ... John I lost you there for justice are going to use ... go ahead do you have dropped out for a second\nOh I'm Sorry the fed is at the fed is setting the price of oil and what the ... oil scarcity there just wouldn't be any oil to buy and so implicit in ... in pushing the interest rate down to zero is that the fed can decree all resources\nNear cost less to access which we know logically it cannot do and so dismantle the fed yeah St Louis the obvious what could possibly do to stimulate or help the economy it quite simply cannot do what its critics and supporters alike believe can't\nSo who was who wants to keep it around John\nOh I think you and I know exactly who wants to keep it around the fed is a convenient whipping boy for Congress and a convenient whipping boy for the president any time we have a recession\nWhich is again a sign of an economy cleansing itself of of what's not working Congress want someone to point to as soon as the person oh the fed raised interest rates the fed heightened credit affected no more credit than than again\nWhen the point you as soon as the president oh the fed raised interest rates the fed I credit that could no more credit than then again\nThe fed it could make it difficult to buy oil these prices are set in the market and so we're always going to have the Federal Reserve around because Congress has a constituency and the banking system they want something to prop up what makes no sense during times of distressed but they also want someone to play\nAnd so you know I say get rid of the fed make serves no purpose I think we all laid out one way or the other four never going to get rid of it is Congress wants someone to point to win their policies are working\nWell I I guess then you know you kind of leave me without an answer John because I uh\nI'd ... I'd like to get rid of it and I'd like to know what it would take to incentive I ... in ... Congress\nOr if it serves the function of belong them a whipping boy looks at them up to you know something that they can beat on every time the economy isn't doing with their constituents one but let's get rid of this thing that serves no purpose and frankly as kind of a disturbing effect on the rest of us\n[noise] um well look I couldn't agree more ah my second book not plug it has called it needs the fed in which I make a case that the fed is is is rushing toward irrelevance it needs to be shut down but I I add\nIf Congress won't do this\nThe I I think the community built um a house you know he was he was not a wealthy guy he was he was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but his community was very grateful for what he had done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and and he was just a symbol guy was\nHe was he didn't want to monetize the experience and I think that that makes him so exceptional\nIt's not you know ... you look at today where people are are constantly trying to you know they would create a reality show around this York didn't want that and I think that that's what makes him exceptional

yesterday afternoon and the yesterday evening congressional investigators had confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations\nOf Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign ... former FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ... the Democratic national\nCommittee private law firm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the ...\nOf an cooperated man whenever we talk about the left it's always uncooperative [laughter] cooperating raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation\nOf Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee\nThe sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing\nIs the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins who we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general\nRod Rosenstein tons of conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump the interview was one of the most productive we've had\nAnd it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after\nThe election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate a new\nHow much the FBI and Justice Department have withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the dance the fusion\nYour collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the dance the fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because once you have there you have\nYou had the first person from the last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you had\nThem now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason if you were investigating Donald Trump\nTo be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn by Internet\nYour investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why\n... why would that be why would that be so that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about Ben I'm sure in the upcoming\nDays or the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now oh pets largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day\nThe energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty six team before the kingdom and allies\nIncluding Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said uh the key insights this is from blue bird their analysis\nSaudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump ... now we've talked about this because we got we we got to a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war we beat Saudi we'd have every other country and\nSomebody called up and they said well banal come prices aren't really really low because there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a\nA you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices have gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is that when you produce your own oil here and we've become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and\nIn fact almost unbelievably good at some levels well that comes from an expansion\nOf you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else was always the the number one category leading as mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and\nEnergy exploration and and\nAnd production is key you don't have\nTo have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point we've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion\nAnd I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThat I get I give credit here to President Trump is where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me we're there for you\nWere there for you all you know are we why are we funding with your military were were there for you all the time ... ah and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia the OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter]\nVery avail back that video that member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways but we've talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat\nCourses nor the Democrats there is no one of the Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit for that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we had talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um\nWhatever wild starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ...\nAnd we had said look and we said this long time ago we saw one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] ... babies are one of the original chair of the original ... [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when disagreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal\nOut it's not really going to be different than the agreement that ... we have now ... a ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing\nYet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a lot like the old NAFTA\nMexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America higher weight higher wages for workers and potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now a yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now assembled by ... miles to in a few other manufacturers\nIn Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nA they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea ... ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA\nAs there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by and as we settled law ... uh we there's been a lot of us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTwo documentaries and more of your favorite pie for our time is going to be our nation coming soon signed up for things to me the personal ...\nYou

doesn't turn out the way they want it to you know but uh again it's going to be interesting I'll tell you we uh have\nA a story coming up uh Tony long a senator here in in Connecticut and he's going to be with us\nAt seven thirty five and the reason that I mentioned it now is it's a very very important story for those of us who are just joining I was\nA Connecticut's economy\nHas shrunk by nine point one percent over the last ten years while the other states in New England saw their economy ... grow\nBy twelve point nine percent ... that was the finding ... of the Connecticut commission\nOn physical stability and economic growth now this is a group of business leaders in this state formed last year by the legislature and Governor Malloy to spark growth\nIn the economy ... and they got ... chairs\nBob actress LA is uh one of the coach chairs and uh Jim Smith\nWho headed up Webster Bank is the other ... chair and this is the statement from mister ...\nFigures are in a ... capable ... irrefutable facts after cell they told ... audience\nAt Greenwich Library where he and fellow coach air gyms ... misspoke on Tuesday night as one author said ... may have been ... you have to be able to face the brute facts\nIt may have been Tim Collins you have to be able to face the brute facts of your current reality\nWhile never giving up faith\nThat you can overcome those obstacles\nYes that's where we came from and uh we are not in good shape at all kinetic it's personal income growth\nRanked forty fourth in the nation in twenty Seventeen and has been in the bottom third of the ranking\nFor the last year they said while the state's economic competitiveness has fallen from aids in two thousand and one two forty third\nIn twenty sixteen\nAnd again I'm going to be talking with senator Tony whine about this at seven thirty five to fill you in and and there is a a statement made by Mr Smith\nAnd this is what he said he said people can't live on the state's minimum wage of ten dollars and ten cents an hour in Connecticut you just can't live on that\nAnd that is one of the problems we've just let it go but I wanted you to to hear this and we were able to get to get this and Bob pact or Sally and Mr Smith are\nThe two who put this all altogether in Connecticut has left I couldn't believe this figure but it's right there\nIn Connecticut has left fifty billion dollars in economic growth on the table over the last ten years it's right over the last ten years so uh we'll have an in depth look at this at seven thirty this morning\nWith senator or Tony long but I I tell ya when I saw this and I got a hold of this I said wow this is really\nUnbelievable Connecticut is one of the few states in the country\nWith and a state tax and is the only one with a gift tax the only one\nIn the country this is such and irate tax to people it's a poke in the rye according to Mr Petra silly\nIt only raises one hundred and fifty million dollars and it's driving people out of the state and I've been telling you that all the law I tell you we have got to do something we really do\nWe've got to turn out and vote on election day we've got to get some new people in there and we really really got to work and I'm so happy\nThat this report was\nPut out when it was put out so that people can understand what we're up against\nIt's a it's quite a situation so uh\nWhen we talk about\nThe costs and everything else\nIt's a killer it really really is and as far as Mr ... concerned\nIt is an irritant to people poke in the eye he uh he calls so I Hope that you'll be listening at\nSeven thirty five this morning when I have a chance to get into all the details with a a senator Tony long of the of the Senate and this was a report out of Greenwich\nOr the other night but when

promising to lift ... selling restrictions and exercise taxes on the rapidly growing local brewery business in this state\nThat's right they noted\nThe eighty plus operating Connecticut breweries are

especially critical of President Trump's mocking of the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford at a political rally in Alabama earlier this week\nI thought it was absolutely wrong and inappropriate and I don't think it's a an issue\nThat a candidate for governor who represents all the people of the state of Connecticut you don't take passes\nOn something like that that was the statement of or Mr Mr Lamont it's gonna be interesting as a election this year is going to be very very interesting\nAnd ah I had mentioned to you several times a year or in in the morning\nThat uh I think that\nThere could be a different outcome\nI think that there has to be some changes there's no question about it and uh I have a ... as something coming up in in a little bit that you know points\n... points to this and a wheel or we'll get to it ah as I said a little bit later however I think it's going to be a very interesting a very very\nInteresting election and a Lamont in ... which are stepping ... mark lay that that that's going to bring on a quite a quite a battle I Believe in I think it's going to be very very close you know in the in the past\nAnd and Connecticut of course is a huge huge democratic state\nSo whether or not the Republicans will be able to or overtake the Democrats I'll tell you there are many out there who are are going to change voting and all you have to do is get out there and talk to\nSome of them and you'll and you'll find out but a an interesting\nA very very interesting election for the state of of Connecticut and people that I talk with a they are are very confident that there will be\nSome changes so the big thing is to get out and vote and I will say this the folks that I talk with and I talked to a good many of them during the during the week\nThey are talking about voting some of them haven't voted for years I had one fellow that told me he has voted for six different times but he's going to vote this year\nSo you know is that going to make the difference will find out we'll find out but uh uh there's so much on both sides that it's going to be very very interesting they Lamont a bicycle which stepping out ski a mark clearly a battle\nThat should be a ... should be a good one and a ... we'll see\nWe'll see but it's all up to a all of us to get out there and to and to vote it's it's really so important for Connecticut a I think we all know if we're honest with each other that we've got to make some\nBoat it's it's really so important work Connecticut ... uh I think we all know you're honest with each other that we've got to make some changes we can't go on like this uh Connecticut ... in deep trouble right now and we've got to get out of it and I think we can\nIf we do a ... if we do\nThe right thing twenty eight minutes after the hour of seven o'clock\n[noise] what ... minutes after seven [noise]\nNews coming up and then I have a very very important [noise]\n\nVery very important to interview with senator Tony Wang and this is all about the big conference that was held a just a the other night and Connecticut to\nIs down nine point one percent over the last ten years while the other states New England saw an economic growth of twelve\nPoint nine percent and what can that do to our state that is the big ... that is the the big question and they had a meeting the other night go chair Bob pack facility or and or the co chair Jim Smith\nAnd other costs on our communities in addition to complement and yet we're told you never hear the other cuts right you never hear about the fact that he is insist that the commission has insisted on re opening up\nThat labor agreement he is also talked about being able to how we fund pensions of our teachers by looking at the lottery funds from from what we do so what people need to understand is people pick and choose what they don't like\nBut this report as something that's someone everyone likes and dislikes we should look at the facts and put everything on the table Brad and that's what people are doing we've not had to make hard decisions on how we move this state for\nThe numbers and the facts don't lie personal income growth is ranked forty fourth in this nation in Connecticut where the bottom third in every ranking for competitiveness for businesses something's got to change this report is a valuable guide\nBut let's not just cherry pick and look at the things that we or or the Democrats like and and celebrate it let's look at\nOpening this document and say there is something people don't like and like let's make changes so those are the things never got picked up right Brett\n... but you know something we here in Connecticut I find as we talk a lot alright everybody's talking we're going to do this we're going to do that but then\nWe never get around to it because people are afraid that they're going to upset somebody and they just are not going right into it to change it we need some big changes in this state to get back what we used to have\nWe absolutely need to make the changes but the problem Brad you talked about it when you don't make any change at all because you're fearful of upsetting people not doing anything at all and sitting still where we are in Connecticut\nRight now we're hurting the same people\nAnd more of the most vulnerable the most at risk the hardest working people trying to make a living pay their mortgage take care of their families because the problem is we're not standing still the rest of the New England is not standing still\nWe need to make these changes and change means that we will be uncomfortable change will mean that we have to change how we live\nAnd and we've not done that and for the last two years because of a balance of equal input in the state Senate\nWe've made difficult decisions we didn't increased taxes we said to the governor that your policies are not what we want in Connecticut we stood up to the governor so\nWhen people do the reality is they want people that will be making changes and not just simply talk\nSo when people don't the reality is they want people that will be making changes and not just simply talk but demonstrated changes in hard leadership decisions\nThe bottom line is Brad we gotta do something and we've already be doing that but the problem is\nThere is so much more that still needs to be done and and I'm excited I'm really excited that we get to go up there with a new governor we get to go up there with a brand new fresh perspective and let's make the changes we need to make the ... do\nYou believe with your heart that we are going to be able to get over the hump that's what I call it a everybody talks big talk but I I just hope that we can get over it we've got to\nWell it's it's a little more than a little hot uh it's a big deal and I'm not saying it's not ever is but but I think I Am\nAbsolutely a believer in Connecticut and and one of the quotes that Bob ... says look you've got to be able to face the brutal fact of our current reality while never giving up faith that we can overcome these obstacles that's where they have stepped up and that's why\nWe have stepped up to run for office because I'm an optimistic person and I believe in Connecticut and I believe we can make the changes that are necessary but we can't\nDo it we can't do it if the people\nDon't allow us to do so so bottom line this is a good start with the fiscal competitive is committed put together but we got to get to work and make the hard decisions because households and I'm In Connecticut do it every single day Brad\nYour listeners who get up early in the morning to go to war to make a living do it every single day it's about time the government reflect the same values the same work ethic the same respect for the dollar that that all of our Connecticut residents do\nWell I'll tell you it is a a beginning and this report is a tremendous report if we if we do this\nWe will get out of where we are there's no question about it's just that we do we have to have the courage to do it and uh I got my fingers crossed let's put it that way\nWell you're an inspiration to us every single day brat so thank you very very much and it is I Believe in Connecticut and I believe we can overcome this but the bottom line is hard decisions need to be made\nWhen people listen to people they need to simply understand what are solutions to fixing the problems we have not just simply talk\nThank you my friend or have a a good weekend and we'll talk soon always a pleasure thank you sir\nYou bet coming up to a quarter of the hour a quarter of eight in the morning and we're going to check and see how the bumper to bumper crowd is doing out there and let's do that right now\nTo

thing says the lab ... he'd been having milk\nOh absolutely ... most of the protests that we have observed over the past five years had been financially supported\nAnd I think it's if anybody advanced effect for example arrives if anyone arrived anywhere with a black map gone in a club they should be arrested they shouldn't be allowed to keep running around intimidating people\nAnd hurting people you know I don't care who they are what they think you just can't have that way and in in a society\n... let me say Barbara you you've hit on something\nAnd one of the things right now that I Am concerned about there's there's no question in my mind there is a large group of people in this country who wants to upset the kind of democracy that we have I Am\nFirmly convinced of that and these are the ways\nThat they try to get into it I mean when when when the FBI now and as I said before I don't know if you heard me say it but the FBI all along\nHas been watching this whole thing it wasn't as though the FBI was not involved so when they got involved okay\nThey didn't do what people wanted them to do the ones that one of the FBI said oh let the FBI lives and now that they have decided that everything is okay now they're going to\nRepel another ... another way\nRight it's it's never enough\nAt and we just have to stop all this ridiculous to have your because this is just people that do not want our constitution upheld you not want to have\nThe freedom that we have in this country they're taking our feed the people are very people that say we have to be tolerant or the people that are trying to take our freedoms away that's why we need a Supreme Court is going to be following the constitution to it to the rule of law not to their\nPersonal ideology and a cap not I don't believe that that kind of person he's not going to follow these are personal ideology he's going to go buy the book he has been you know oddly enough Elena Kagan even hired yeah she's a Supreme Court justice who was appointed by Brock Obama\nAnd and she and so to my heart that you can email Supreme Court justices that rock Obama nominated and we're we're a\nAcquainted to this court um are\nIn my mind and listening to what they have said a over the years are very questionable people and everybody just let them go right through without any kind of question because they were women\nYou know there are all these all these identity politics to enter into things and you have to stop that 'cause that it's a destructive things to our culture and this is destroying relationships between men and women and how people can behave and it's just\nRidiculous and have a constitution time to follow it nobody's guilty until proven innocent we're all innocent until proven guilty\nBarbara thank you for the call back you\nHave a good weekend Eighteen minutes before the hour of nine o'clock in the morning you know it is a ... a quite a story there's no uh no question

bowed\nWhile they have our listeners called on that ... that is an incredible saying when you think about it because my head is bloodied but it's about\nBut it's about ... what a ... boy I Would I was a male or female male a man I mean when you think about what's going on for the past\nWeirdly enough a week I remember sitting here last week we were taking the phone calls about this that I Know some of the most that we've had in a long time and\nWell just the reaction that come from a we've even had to cut gash Roy because of\nThe demand of calls that we had but this is the thing Brad people are tired of ... of all the micromanaging just because of the ... just because of party politics it's got to stop and it's getting worse and worse\nBut I'm you know what would the upsets me and say look he has a right he's a representative Elijah Cummings the he wanted us to go back again he doesn't think that it was handled it was handled correctly\nOr it would be nice to see the judge that is judge or a cabin or take a lie detector test Dr Ford did it he should do it\nAnd uh again\nHe was investigated by the FBI and that's what everybody wanted including\nIncluding a ... as people like a a Mr Cummings again I just uh I just couldn't couldn't understand some of the thoughts that went into this the FBI investigation happened it happened\nBut because it didn't come out the way that the some of these folks wanted they ah want all kinds of things\nAll kinds of things to happen okay coming up to a eight forty five a quarter\nOf nine on this Friday morning Noah again when you when you think

I was never\nHad a party with Brett Kavanaugh as described by Ford and then those who are pretending this is about truth and justice in fact finding\nA pressuring her to change her story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\nWell it's also a crime yes offer\nAnd a lot of that can be looked at it after this who ... who leaked Ford's identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's on the Senate and Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed to the late and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just been awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and\nHopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because this will be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually but\nOther folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks try it\nEr net for things these men have never done to them personally and individually but other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks try ... drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names and their personal home addresses that that's not that's not with the first amendment that's just crazy that's going to be crazy\nYou know do you um think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the\nPress conference which I think was one of his best press conferences Las Vegas incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught up a really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight for what you believe in a fight for principle fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator\nThat the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him solve for America and he he's not ... they called him a bully killing you know I think the bullies are the people\nWho are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants\nAnd and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large shock me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's\nNot that way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony\nDown there to protect vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and backed down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL\nBrett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other while at all but the president fallen judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo he's sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more lower if they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitution the law there is\nNo such are no doubt on about ... they're talking about a passage\nFrom a yearbook you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just drive a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans ... as a logical and beyond commonsense I respect them or if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about what these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women\nAnd specifically the uh this idea\nThat if you're if you're an accuser you must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe then you're anti warmer\nOr you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying herself as victims of this or victims of that because I mean that's not going to help you advance as a person as being at a victim\nDoesn't end that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the need to move in every man is it raises every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of sexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost and they didn't here\nAs well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their while they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were where she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and his shoulders should not be should not be shouldering the entire me to live and by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year\nAnniversary the me too movement but you know who started it not bright Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein yeah ... years ago today it was Harvey winds dean major democratic donor\nYou're not going to find him in a picture of Brett Kavanaugh you're going to find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nYeah exactly a year ago today it was Harvey wines dean major democratic donor\nYou're not going to find him in a picture of the Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton and a lotta a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful\nAnd very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and done the women describing\nKind of something thirty six years ... years ago is dong corroborated\nOr this was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so interesting so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to uh your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... a ...\nWhy can't you be the egg Kelly in the ... egg\nAnd tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth\nThey say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding and compelling would love to hear yours is very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice Rome shouldn't hold on I'm not I don't know your value okay you can't just throw that out\nAs a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\n...\nWho I have their reaction to that ...

Seventy nine percent of a democratic women are saying that it's very important so the Republican women seem to have an edge here what are you hearing melody\nI'm hearing a lot from our men and women as well and the women here at our state and there's also have been a cop\nDid you hear what are you hearing military\nI'm hearing a lot from our men and women as well and the women here in our state and there's also have been a couple of polls done here just recently\nThat there was one that said there are sixty four percent of West Virginians\nThat want Kavanaugh confirmed and then there was another one that says there's fifty three percent\nThen won't Kevin ... is overwhelmingly for Kavanaugh and I've heard people say that the party of JFK has turned into Marlboro and that's exactly what's happened\nPeople are really livid over this and this is really about the Democrats trying to uh go back to the twenty sixteen election and try to cancel the election of Donald Trump and it's about roe versus Wade as well\nWhere military you also have Joe Manchin as your senator in West Virginia or what do you make of his coming out and voting for cloture which indicates but doesn't always mean that uh he might support becoming a nomination\nWell let me just sum up senator Manchin like this if you like to play football\nYou see somebody that that makes a taco well Joe Manchin doesn't have enough leadership enough courage to make the taco Joe Manchin towels on after ... minutes just exactly the way he's doing this he string and everybody along\nOkay well we'll see how many votes but this is um do you junior Howard I Want to go to you you're the Republican National committee woman from Georgia\nI'm do are women in an old seeing this as we heard Amy Schumer tried to frame this as we've heard so many Democratic senators or try to frame this as a vote for Kavanaugh is a vote against women than a vote against women who suffered some kind of abuse is that what you are people telling you\nQuite the opposite my people and not just melody said not just women but men to that mainly when then I have had more women come up to me and say I was in the Carter that baby toward the other day and the checkout lady was so upset about it women are saying that this is my concern\nIs that we played the politics of gender and women against men and all and the ... and I'm a woman and I and I it's in a front can aid that we did it it just makes me very angry that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to the right through it\nYou know a five hundred forty lore is the number\nI'm ... and you know ... it's not only women I think\nYou know learn I just talked so often about those men and women watching this I was I live in New Orleans and I was in New Orleans the other day and they had the TV on at a lunch spot I'd go to and this is not you know hardly a democratic or Republican spot it's a New Orleans what everybody's there\nAnd the conversation I overheard for mothers aunts sisters above ... and in many of them said look I I I don't I was against this guy's nomination bloods after watching the way he was treated\nI feel my gosh this could be my husband my son my my my nephew they see they've now it seems a dental finding personalized the um attacks on on Capitol and the\nThe the immorality of empty attacks that are just pounded in with no evidence Jody Smith give me your reaction to this year the Indiana State director for the Susan B. Anthony Lewis water using\nAll week I can just to absolutely agree with what everyone else is that we've knocked over four hundred thousand doors and Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage of being innocent before proven\nUm that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged in America\nWe believe in the bill of rights and the constitution and that means that you are innocent until you're proven guilty or not the opposite way and that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind\nKnow you you see a lot of that and and I think um the ... again I think the American people at their core or fear or beyond ideology beyond anything else they're fair minded people and had\nThese allegations handout has a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting sold on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we're\nSalt on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think we may not be seeing the you're the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash\nDemand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back happy very quickly just want to ask you that the polls are tightening up between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ... well I I helped settle on it it's all of that turnout at those who are concerned about having a it's a part of an ... you got to get out there and the turnout will matter I think Kelly can land and we all have to pull together\nOr we believe that there ladies please stay with us we're going to take a quick break and we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty lower the ... show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news chef safe\n[noise] [noise]\nI myself and the mother of two children my daughter is Fifteen and\nI Wonder is means so that you're ... you're worried about your daughter will not be able to what\nI worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress that her experiences that her safety is not important\nBut is it about abortion so you're wearing your daughter or not we are also worried that my daughter will not have the right to control her okay okay I just I just wanted to or town hall thank God I'm worried about\nYour reaction to the Jodi Smith the of the Susan B. Anthony Lewis the Indiana State directed\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of friends\nAnd I would be I'm very concerned about ah my daughter or son I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards\nUm towards a Christine Christine but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences you know we have a very tight Senate race here as well and\nWhen people choose to initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters change as to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that\nNow and one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is mothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family so it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed to be full and be proven guilty so that's\nWhy I Love Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel ... they didn't have a real strong feeling about Brecht coming on the same way the president said a ... up until we can go to knew he was but watching this play out watching the dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence\nI think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport and a man's reputation his family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what\nIn his family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders\nNo matter what at all calls and I think the American people now\nAre about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down a political opponent at any cost with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all the time but in public\nAnd even force of of of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon\nThat I think is is\nThat the Americans look at that and go Mm this concerns me junior I Want to ask you um you you have a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia\nBetween Stacey Abrams in and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points do you believe female conservatives are going to a rally there in that Governor ...\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearing is going to really play into that because it's making when I\nWas really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I said the Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian camp is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that our party is all about so I really do think and I had thing just in the last week or so across the day people are more motivated than ever now to get out get out and that and not only that but volunteer that I was at camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get yard signs\nAnd the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh\nHearings and how we see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and people don't want the death they really are discouraged\nYeah no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office\nAnd it was that kind of well he called the silent majority I'm my sense it's it's just working Americans\nAnd Americans are not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the work and they're working they've privately held their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families ... occasionally to their friends\nBut it's not something you go to war over and ... today in Washington I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply don't talk to each other and it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once it was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view\nToday it's slash smash and destroy and I don't think Americans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the streets but my mom's ... wives are working women I I don't think it's where they live\nI'm going to give a quick round Robin we are going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on where we might be headed here in these midterms\nI think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a a very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote\nFor Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda\nAnd I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for cable because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them and all fifty five went for Trump and the election so that meant and twenty six states that made that we'd had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are or we're going to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that the everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath trying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for a military we need we need you in December so hanging have\nEmail last breath I'm so busy [laughter]\nWell you keep going great to talk to your junior high our last\nWord do you um you're you're

friends I Love ...\nI Love that book too and\nOne of the things I grass from reading that book and other books as this\nThere is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation those of us that are wise and emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself\nFree from the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive\nYou're not setting the victimize or free you're setting you yourself free you can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nThan lady called a minute ago and was\nTrying to figure out how to should she reconnect with her brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting her brother in law\nAfter he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years his wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she doesn't won't be around it\nSo here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine\nI Can't imagine going through something like that\n\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars is to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy\nBut when you when you do for give them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever to someone who rage meaning you wouldn't go on a date with them you know someone steals your wallet\n\nYou can forgive them but you're not going to leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with\nThem probably ever in that situation one of the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\n\nKnow the guy's wife is who was wrong right\nPersonally wrong her\n\nYou know the guy's wife is who was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong or brother in law however I don't know how it worked as a brother in law but anyway as it was a lot of I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway\nThe the lady that the the wife is who was wrong to she forgave and was reconciled to the husband as he supposedly is putting his life by giving them I mean everybody's life back together I don't know the guy and you don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it\nYou know any one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nIn everyone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and reading my hands and be mad at him and worry about him I Hope he's turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife I'm I can\nI can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that's what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his\nConversion his turnaround Israel say we run into this all the time with their coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again after that\n\nMatter if you're going to stay married you're pretty well\nInstantaneously gonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled who you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is a ... as I\nYou know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroy anything yeah family's finances its own be livable\nSo he comes and he's discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing is pastor and he's\nSeeing a a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let them go run have again no no it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that\nThat that may not have control of and not have any access to money\nFor a while until trust as rebuild overtime but\nTen years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it should be better than it is now two years later I should be better than that\nIt should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not going to treat you like you have no\nAbility to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you till you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and overtime it's rebuilt if you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not\nEntering into the negative behavior\nAnd you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you\nAnd two years\nClean if the guy's clean from his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing porn addiction whatever it was sound like it was all of that\nYears is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still\nGot behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming\nThis guy straight and if he's straight for two years than you know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already she might just be an enabler she might be she might be ... and that could be what's going on [noise]\nCould be that he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive\nSay that is a difference there's a difference in for\nYou know

going to get out of it and we got to make make that decision and so we made the decision that\nYou know you either got to take the pain of discipline or you've got to take the pain of regret and we had to pay a regret for so many years and we said we're done with that and we want the pain and discipline and so we had to tell her kids um\nHad to tell my son were not doing basketball training

year we're entering what looks to be a lengthy and intense custody battle with my ex wife have to hire an attorney and it looks like he'll be expensive or should we pause baby step to to pay for this or should withhold are falling the paperwork until we have the debt paid off\n[noise] um [noise]\nWell the fact that you asked me\nIf you should hold off following the paperwork tells me that that is an option see I don't know what is going on those custody battle ... and all kinds of different things can go on there if I thought my child was in danger if I thought there was a predator\nA that my ex was marrying or I thought ... uh some real extreme thing than I'm going to cause the baby step when we're going to take care of the\n... primary\nBut the fact that you mention in your email that we could wait tells me that this is more like you are aggravated with her\n[noise] which would be like kind of standard operating procedure right so um if if the child is not in danger and is not is not\nHarmed by you waiting a year yeah I'd get out of debt before I entered a lengthy custody battle because it'll put you in a stronger position to enter that battle you'll have the cash flow to just stay in the game 'cause most of the time when you get into something like that the first one that runs out of cash as we lose is not the first one was right\nAnd so you got to have war chest man and um\nIf you're delaying it until your debt free one year from now\nAnd so you got to have war chest man and um\nIt it is delaying it until your debt free one year from now is a is a reasonable option

the gates fall [noise] right but um [noise]\nOtherwise it's going to your ear you're fighting from a weekend position so you know I don't know what's going on so I can tell whether that's a couple of different ways of looking at a Chris is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi\nChris how are you oh I'm doing great how are you better than I deserve what's\nGood to hear [noise] um I have a quick question my brother and I are a part of the small business and I'm Around land fear my wife uncle\nHad um had a sign up for what's called a caveman insurance policy now I'm a little ignorant to as to what it is going to bring that into a contract to my wife and me than my benefits here but in the event that anything happened to me to get my portion of the business\nBut it also works as a retirement fund the type of things that I'm kind of just calling to see what\nWhat your opinion is of that type of policy and if it's necessary or or what I what I should do\n... came in is what it's doing it's not a type of policy so let's separate the two things I mean I sold you a piece of crap called a whole live life insurance policy because it has built it is okay has a built in savings program okay so we're we're going to cancel the stupid Paul Keim man's simply means\nIt's typically used in in a situation like you were in in business uh by cell agreement and the way it would work is that\nUh you you said you're in business with who your brother or my brother okay and so uh let's say you died the life insurance on you would go to him giving him the money to buy your share of the business\n[noise] from your wife [noise] okay\nBecause he doesn't want to be a partner with your wife or not because he ate your wife maybe because you had your wife but not because he had your wife but more likely because she didn't want to be in the business right\nSo it gives them the money and you do it in reverse as well he needs to buy a policy on him that goes to you but it's slated end the partnership\nHave the same thing and we're both\nOkay so you're both going to cancel this crap and I was going to get up we bought a piece of crap yeah you're going to buy term\nLife insurance little do the same thing for about a nickel on the dollar for what you're paying now okay what's the face some adult it's what's the face of Memphis given to him if you die\nOr her\nUm I have to I'd have to look back I don't I don't remember what we signed up for like I said it was this as well over a year ago okay I'm In putting in you know paying their\nPremiums yeah premium I suppose to have you know like a ten years you know have\nArticles are are you in L. L. C. or are you a general partnership weren't escort escort okay do you have articles have been corporation that defined what happens in the event of death um I'm not sure if I could find what happened to me than a dad and now I'm not I don't know you need to have a what's\nCalled a by cell agreement okay and it's funded by inexpensive term life insurance\nTerm okay have you with the term I mean certainly there's a whole like\nAll the ... that have goes whole lives as the only one that has a retirement benefit later okay I got that means it as a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you and got me he's like oh when you're you know when you're sixty this is what the\n... the cash value will be yeah\nYeah and ... it took on the net number at the end and I'm like okay\nSo here's the thing if you spend one acts instead of twenty acts to accomplish your business goal of being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot that died right\nUh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold you okay that's the problem collide life insurance has a horrible right of return it's loaded with fees\nAnd uh if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value and so the ... the money that you're playing\nTime for the money that you're paying extra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nI Gotcha okay that makes sense yeah I'm In I'm a new listener so I you know six months I've kinda been grinding looking at my watch in our own baby step to cool I'm now going to want to cash out that whatever and then the whole like you and then you'd go with in terms of\nOr you get a term policy in place first case she died while the polarizing issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this\n... or you get a term policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this\nAnd you can accomplish the goal and it's going to help clean up your escort corporate documents right by having your attorney and it's not it's a one page thing but it's you know ... and then you need to cover that with all four of you sit down their spouses and go okay\nIf he dies I won't be getting money to buy you out sister in law okay\nYou're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die my wife's going to be out of business 'cause my brother's going to buy route and he's going to have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom from this new term ...\nAnd it it has stated that that money has to be used for that\nOr that specific bought for the buyout yup yup oh that's the by cell\nAgreement very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your\nBank your brother thanks for calling him open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\n[noise] John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a life insurance today I'm ... group live insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company\nThat's what you would have to mean by that does the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on into our group you buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished who you through your company\nAs a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance benefits package or life insurance benefits package um I it's okay to buy that\nIt's usually if you are buying it for you if your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying\nFor it it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in insurance world is you leave the company you can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or a minor heart attack and now you're not sure if\nYou get diabetes now you're not in ...\nAnd you leave that company you got no life insurance that you can't take this with you says okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all there this is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nYeah the entertainment quid and the

good stuff you guys so what do you tell people when they find out you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what do you don't like the keys to getting out of debt are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a newer car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a guard for five or six years and then what do you think you should we get another payment and so we have not had a car payment for four\nYears uh were driving to very old cars one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old wow\nBut we drove it up here from South Carolina this morning and it might have on so it made it finally gets us where we need to go and they'll never again\nNever again well now you don't have your payments or you can save up in ... Bob below better car that's right yeah what about you know early what are usually the keys to getting out of that are\nUm for me it was mostly contentment ... I like I like to watch HDTV [laughter] and make lots of honey do list a laid back and kind of have to be content with what we've got and I'm just kind of weight on it until we saved up for it\nI'm kinda interested when you sat down to do the taxes that night and you had a moment it was kind of that I've had it moment we're not living like this anymore I'm I've come to the end of the U.S we're going to change can you describe what was happening inside of you or what was happening in your head or in your heart\n... I felt like probably like everything I was doing was kind of ... ... I mean I kind of I wanted to be a stay at home mom\nBut with his income that required me to go back to work until we didn't go to school and\nMom but when his income that requires me to go back to work until we didn't go back to school and but it wasn't making any different than it is we wish telling that we were making any progress and everything that came in with going right back out or\nYou know don't inviting feels like a rat in the oil\nAnd we kind of made a goal back then that we wanted to be free by the time my son went to high school and so we did that by a month oh awesome you started I school this August and we were dead free in July\nSo his senior years the debt for a year ... when you started started Ashville\nOregon we didn't want all just growing up years to be in that and we wanted him to to to learn from us and understand what it means to to get out of bed and we haven't taken a vacation in two years of them\nYou know be ... you know we've gone to the beach every year and uh he was frustrated but he was you understood and every so often it was kinda cool because we would take these little sticky notes\nEvery month when paid offered but what our new balance was free and we put on the refrigerator would put it on the bathroom mirror ... and every so often you would walk in the kitchen and say where we are I Know where we are so he he was he was kind of in tune with the whole thing\nYou know so you know he'll have that memory um when he looks back even if he stumbles a little bit financially and you'll still have that memory going I remember when mom and dad did that\nAnd so I can do that you you've changed your family tree in that regard it's like I've got the memory and you do to maybe ...

I'm Sorry what are you doing what the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his death he still has about um Fifteen K left on the equity loan ... ... thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house and\nIt was how much are you able to put on the debt\nI'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\n[noise] a month ...\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get the right\nTo aid on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay and do you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year okay and and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead and you're right\nYou're going to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plant that I understand that right yes I was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly\nThat he just can't do that and I'm afraid I you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year mhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything\nYou can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay mom yeah\nNot ideal not what we want but we probably get there and uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses where we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a mistake for retirement\nIt's clear that that and to have that emerges from unemployed\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good to know what I'm asking is why a bank loan um someone at his age fifty K. animal you know four and a and to be paid off in twenty forty three knowing that\nHe wouldn't live that long\nFor two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is is they're counting on my house I've got a lien against the house right well that's yeah\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral\nAs part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying the lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing\nYou know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOn ...\nAnd so the industry is just stupid ... is what it amounts to but\nUh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean dead people get credit card offers so you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just be you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations\nTim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing today if I got to require retirement pushes the okay I'm fifty two here about a year ... and um I have a venture then I'll have a boy when he came off of you know pretty good at like\n... like workers are at fifty two would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it 'cause if they if they always say food with the whole time really if\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is\nYou can run the mouse out [noise]\nBut usually your rate of return on your four one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your\nSocial Security check will grow if you delay it and that's the way you're comparing it to say if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know and what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um\nAnd then the other question comes or you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it\nUm by not taking after four one K. or some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different parts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh that would definitely\nYeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average depth page of a male and the U.S is Seventy six average does a deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now\nAnd so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question ma'am thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five taught as in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I ... I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself and for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit is you would say from listening to your show addict away now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um but my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd I'm five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise] she I'm cheese are always around the show and I kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me is about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got about\n... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a book in there\nHe is it is I started to read that I have readings\nTotal makeover has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do just save a thousand dollars you know written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay we want you to do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say that I was in dollars if you already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop\nAll investing temporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except for home by losing your debts\nSmallest allows you attack those were caused by getting rid of those that famous and now you've got the ability to invest\nTheir once that's done you build your emergency fund\nAnd then you start retirement as baby step so that book is going to want to sort of and make sure you and your water for one thing is I gather you get on the same page 'cause\nOnce you do get on this thing and [noise]\n\n\nAnd that you don't need to live that way so that was really the hardest part was just\nSeeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it better place\nBut it's always just seeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it is better plan\nIt was a good

injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to you is can you believe this\nWhat else happened in the ... republic that is akin to what's happening in America today weekend police authority rampant lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing criminals subtly proliferated\nWhat else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about\nThe backlash said this liberalism\nArose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany\nAnd you have groups like on the ... the ... cowards are put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks will go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world has seen this\nThe windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people haven't backwards\nNow don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown stretch I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember when I said many times those do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing what do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the fought today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the kiss of today at dawn by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there so the communists weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they're attacking the Republicans now senators no one stops them it's as though we're powerless to protect ourselves from these ... so the Germans said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units called brown shirts and they started beating of communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you to be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story\nBiggest is this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shirts and some more men and joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up\nAn opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing that you and I sent and so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong because the left would likely to think he's at least the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point in my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut its solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left would say any of us illusions are extreme to the left said the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a cab and it was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much beyond what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what did Jerry Nadler do in college what a Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat he's doing he drank vanish habits drank too much about a sham it's what what are you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy I went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an aberration\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left and it's super liberalism\nIs a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong or you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about\nTrust me on that see this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout in in the west a a right wing leader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn
