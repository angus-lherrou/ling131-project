Mark\nFriends holding [noise]\nOh [laughter] looking back at what age take takes four to eight seven six six and I'm Mark listening in Leesburg, Florida hey mark\nA bright while you're doing\nGood where do you think about all these ... nine separate packages now what do you think the overall aim is it's got to be from the same people\nSure um first of all you can leave your shirt on TALK and you got to make a statement get some of the gods Caesar Robert ... oh really okay yeah I'm I think it's a group of people I think it's multiple people that are doing this um I don't think it's just one person I think they want to make an impact they didn't go after the Democrats\nAnd they didn't go as they didn't target both of them\nBecause they wanted to make an impact so they just went up to the Democrats to make you know give Trump a hard time I think it's um it's a group of them not just one mob mentality work in a group like they did with Kavanaugh ethic that's what the problem is that I think you're going to find is that what it's a bunch of all\nAnd try and I'm In reverse for instance prize actually occur in from the time these packages were mailed in place in the mail saying they have to figure out what happened in between and where the packages were and try and pay for all this together you know the the things we talked about before finding cameras finding potential witnesses riding the male friend that had all these devices\n[noise] ah so that's who's doing it and that's where we sense and I hear there's a there's a lot of activity in Florida right now we know Debbie Wasserman Schultz was on the return address for just about everyone what do you think it means a Shannon and we're glad about this that these are bomb it looks like a bomb but there's no detonation ability with these\n[laughter] right I mean you know somebody that I talked to off the record who is also very deep into these kinds of investigations not this one in particular said you didn't have to really look at the sit there and you know the people who are examining these are the bomb techs and the specialists through the FBI they know almost immediately whether something is a viable device or not\nAnd lessen the authorities in New York has said these are not hoaxes these are potentially viable devices [noise] um but not one has gone off and apparently none of the packaging the way that normally they would expect something like this to be done if they actually want to hurt or killed people is it the packages booby trapped\nTo go off when you open it they said that wasn't part of it either so is it just to strictly in the work quote terrorizing me to instill terror and people to frighten people or is it actually about harming people I mean these are two very very different objectives and I\nThink they know a lot more about that then they're saying at this\nPoint you're talking to show debris move by the way as those were attorney handles or legal stuff here and now that my personal stuff you will notarized anything and that bothers me when he won't\nPay me enough stance aren't free\nDon't you feel bad uh charging as a notary\nI don't I don't know like anger that I Need that four dollars and it makes a difference for me so if you want your document I'm going to need the four dollar\nDoes fun so a lot of people are saying the president should have taken a more conciliatory tone a stump speech but he said he's fighting back and he's saying listen maybe if you weren't ripping mean Ninety two percent of the time going just at CNN and MSNBC you wouldn't create so much for the usual Rush Limbaugh said coach his team\nBecause they're not they're trying to pass responsibility there's lots of Donald Trump in and trying to get us to shut up in response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here and saying oh no no no no the factory can't comment while they comment left and right start ragged on Trump\nOr his supporters or what have you well we're supposed to sit here and be polite and have good manners and not say anything about it\nAnd the the for the most part I Am stunned I thought on the Sunday show to get a lot of opinion and talking about President Trump's tone and Maxine Waters and the horrible comments Eric Holder said we're going to kick 'em and\n... this was happening hours after the packages were found Shannon mhm so you're going to get worse until we find out why\nInteresting because guide ... who wrote a piece in town hall yesterday and he pointed to some um [noise] video of Nancy Pelosi after the shooting that nearly killed these ... and she was in a press\nConference and it it must have been within a day or two after this had happened to shooting it happened and she asked\nAbout those who are trying to link is to potentially someone on the left or somebody who was upset by the Democrats which we now know exactly how that played out and her comments word this is outrageous how dare dare you go there as she's disgusting this was a terrible event\nHow dare you make any links between political ideology or try to blame this on anyone but for the president for the White House they feel like that's exactly what's happening to them by now I mean we had a guest on last night um who was the deputy chair\nBut for the president for the White House they feel like that's exactly what's happening to them by now I mean we had a guest on last night um\nWho was the deputy chair of the DNC or vice chair and Michael I'm Blake and he\nStarted immediately saying the president bears some responsibility to this and I said wait a minute what exactly are you saying I mean the person who put these devices together and mailed them and put them into the stream to try to frighten people or wherever the objective was\nThat the person who is responsible for this and he wanted to have it both ways that they don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the president actually did this and I said well what you're saying is the president bears some responsibility for that and you have to be very clear about that because you know in those conversations in the weeks a after ... was almost killed there were a lot of folks who are objecting\nAnd saying it's not fair to ... to a particular party and the truth as it is the individual who pulled the trigger or makes device that\nIs ultimately the person that is very troubled and has a problem and they're the ones are left or right or center or if they're just disturbed in some way they're the ones who's made he'll have made this decision to um put these things in a place\nI Want to be a ... that's a big topic or the other topic of course the midterms and the care of and but I Want to bring into the robber motivation\nBecause on radio and TV we had George Papadopoulos a member of the twenty eight now thirty one year old who is a unpaid foreign policy advisor who pled guilty to lying to the FBI\nNow he's starting to put his whole the series of events together and he believes the D. O. J. and the FBI along with three separate countries combined to set him up\nBecause they didn't want to be president only did become president they wanted to hurt him and he loses evidence of actor John ... his uh uh uh his original contact those original contact in England it was a ... a professor and now we find out\nA working for British Intelligence and then we find out to the ambassador down or Abbott says Clinton ties also supposed to be linked to Australian and British Intelligence and now we also find out this stuff and how for an American who worked for the FBI all targeted him\nWhile he sat in house arrest in uh Chicago apartment watching all this money go out the window he wants to know over a overturn a\nOverturned his conviction in his plea here's what Mark Meadows said after going after hearing what he had to say behind closed doors yesterday and the committee hearing cut thirty two\nI can tell you that I Am very trouble than his Fourth Amendment rights may have been violated in it the way that this was conducted was certainly inappropriate and not what we would believe to be standard protocol for the FBI\nDidn't like it a went on cut thirty three\nYou know listen I have if he testifies publicly based on what we just heard today uh I think the American people would would side with George Papadopoulos uh uh regardless of party or when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nNot happening but he was pretty move by what he heard behind closed doors what are you hearing 'cause he's starting to realize that all these people were setting them up\nI think it's really interesting your interview this morning I'm which of course I was on wait to see if I\nRead the transcripts or he lays out a very interesting set of um a dance and circumstances in people and timing that raises a lot of questions I think for anybody who had a real desire to know exactly\nWhat was happening with it that's the case and how it got started um who the players were what the aim was I mean what he lays out he makes a good case for himself and for that you know his theory that he was being set up in an effort to then be able to go after the Trump campaign in some way or the president himself should he win [noise]\nUm I think people should listen to what he has to say and and make a judgment about it but you know he's drawing some links and connecting the dots or in a way that I think raised a lot of very very serious question\nAnd I'll paraphrase show and he said that one of the tweets that Peter Struck had a was a that he was we are beginning to what our source or or or Russian source or or source in England where in Britain is beginning to talk about Russia connections it was the same day that ambassador downer\nA it was the day after he met with a mass or downer\nAnd he ended up being a tape conversation to somehow Peter Struck get that he does not believe that was a coincidence cases on the Russians source original source I had no Russian connections you mix it came up to me and approached me and asked me if I if they told me that Hillary Clinton's emails were about to be released\nSo then he gets an information ... unsolicited and then these asset by downer who turns out he's a British asset who gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation\nAnd Australian of more than just sending Vassar so he's challenging that and he says will data was even nice egos he was he was very aggressive towards me told me as you walk away from Trump these horrible person that we've never going to get elected\nYou chose you not and he says will data was even nice egos he was he was very aggressive towards me told me as you walk away from Trump these horrible person that we'd never going to get elected so\nI'm listening to all this they're all connected together you know it's something else to this\nCruise to re steel made his name by investigating the world cup and exposing corruption right guess who was a member of the world cup committee Smith sent us who do not get charge lifted and he's one of the few not to charge so there's a relationship there before Donald Trump was even running for president\nSo yeah I mean it's a it's a drama that you can't believe that that actually probably took place\nRight if it was scripted as a movie [laughter] I keep all might say like this is just too fantastical I mean it's just all of the different links and all of the different connection and you think about this guy twenty eight years old at the time\nI mean thought he was doing a good thing by um you know helping out at a campaign and the candidate that he's very much believed in it sounds like he's still very much does do believe in um the ad but feeling that now that he was a pond and the situation and that's that's\nHighly possible I mean when you think about the level of sophistication of the people that he was interacting with and their connection to each other um it just raises so many questions and along the way I'm sure you've thought as many Americans have thought I'm with things that have been uncovered you think about what would these people thinking at the time some of these key players\nAnd it's only can be that they just assumed like most people did there was no way that Hillary Clinton wouldn't become president\nAnd yes we will bring a hockey team\nBack to Connecticut I Will lower your deductibles I Will cut the cost of care I Will let women foreign business faster\nOutlet schools form anywhere I Will never

Fox News a\nHow how for how new argument for eating organic\nStudy from France find the people who eat organic food on a regular basis are less likely to develop cancer but some nutrition experts are skeptical the U.S department of agriculture says for something can be certified as organic it must be free of pesticides chemical fertilizers and dies it also can't be processed using genetic engineering [noise]\nGenerally you pay more for organic food\nThe study tracking nearly Seventy thousand volunteers over several years down a lower rate of cancer diagnoses among people who said they ate a lot of organic food\nTo study was published in general internal medicine which also included a commentary by nutrition experts pointed out flaws in the study\nThey said other factors can be responsible for the cancer statistics and the jury is still out on whether eating organic food will lower your cancer risk for more help do that at Fox News health dot com alcohol for health on an alley Appalachia boxing [noise]\n\n\nThey are welcome back everyone a General Stanley McChrystal is a in Studio he's written a brand new book along with a jet beggars and Jason men Jones I say they\nRan go men go home or in a leader's he's called leaders myth and reality and you went back in history to make sure you had it right and you had a confession earlier you didn't have everything right in your first two weeks to leadership bugs or you learn more\nWell we certainly didn't have some things right now I thought about leadership and so we went back to look at these Thirteen leaders in history and to see what about them we didn't really understand that so we did these pairs of genre we did geniuses and reformers founders\nPower brokers and we tried to look at Thirteen fairly diverse leadership experiences by people and see what it is leadership really is\nGoing to throw it was so mad at you please I lose who could Walt Disney what did we learn from Walt Disney struck down with cancer early probably would have been even bigger in greater but man his legacy lives on in his name has never been stronger what did he do\nWell it was extraordinary is a very talented animator in his early years she created this studio they created Mickey Mouse and really technological breakthroughs\nBut then from Nineteen thirty ... thirty seven he drove his team to produce Snow White the first full linked animated feature and it was extraordinarily successful even though we\nBut uh thirty seven he drove his team to produce Snow White the first full linked animated feature and it was extraordinarily successful even though we had to mortgage that company and mortgage the eye Peter Mickey Mouse to fund the picture was hugely successful\nFor years later we as a bitter strike for many of those same animators\nBecause the company had grown has gotten more corporate the structure and the bureaucracy had changed and suddenly the kind of leader he been at a smaller more family like company\nShe couldn't do here and he couldn't grow we couldn't adapt to that new reality show what really happened ... brother Roy ran the corporate side of the Disney studios from then on\nWalt Disney focused on things like Disneyland so he was great in imagining things and focusing on ... projects his brother became great at running baking part\nSo if Stanley McChrystal was looking at Walt Disney in his forties thirties and forties do you try to get more due to try to broaden out Walt Disney or you just try to get somebody with a skill set to match the problem\nWell that's a great that's a great question I think the first thing you do is try to get Walt Disney to adapt but there are some people who can't or just are not interested in adapting and then what you've got to realize is he's not the right leader for the new reality of the Disney studios and then you bring somebody knew a\nLittle bit like apple and we're usually with Steve Jobs he was basically an insurgency in a company that he created when he came back he even said he was better suited for that job\nWhen that gets exact it in the ... group the leader is all in context the followers and the situation determine the leadership effectiveness Margaret Thatcher\nShe was strong convictions believe very strongly and certainly conservative ideas because she was so unwavering in that she became very very appealing to the British you went through the very difficult I teach seventies she became a very popular prime minister and then after about eleven years\nThe arc of her leadership she became more autocratic to vary from confidence style she had before it began to wear fan on people and she was essentially politically assassinated now it wasn't that she had lost it it was that the times had changed\nThe context it changed her followers had gotten where were you ever style and they essentially pushed her aside\nI hate to boil everything down to sports but how many great coaches hit the

there are people that still they they they don't change their talk they talk the same way about him\nOh you know the last forty five percent of your loved one forty five percent who have them and not not dissimilar to how people felt about Obama Bush Clinton I think the difference is more intense with Trump but uh yeah you're not gonna change people one way or the other on all this\nAre you a are you seeing some of his ratings going up or are they going down\nWhile they were going up or last week I don't know what's gonna happen\nNow in the wake of all the chaos and the and frankly the stock

closely this week what happened to the stock market\nWill again my friend I Am glad that you were able to get I Know how busy you are I mean I I read a lot and boy I'll tell you when it comes to

[noise]\nIs red ink and you're talking about spending billions more how you got to do that while they just want to wave a magic wand in tax those rich people in Greenwich I'm very end they don't understand that all we're doing is is a cutting off your nose despite your face because when they leave\nYou you don't have that income tax anymore so that's why we're in the quandary we're in today\nDo you believe in you lived in in the political atmosphere for a long long time and have done a good job too I my dad or do you believe\nThat we can do it this time I don't know what it is in me but something tells me that it's not going to be the change maybe I'm completely wrong I don't know but I've talked to an awful lot of people because I get out alive\nAnd uh I I've I've talked to Democrats I've talked to ... you know and and I'd I'd had Democrats I had one one guy tell me I'm forgetting I'm forgetting I'm a Democrat this time that's what he said to me you\nKnow so I don't know I I'm an internal optimist a bread I have to\nHave to stay that way and\nAnd I will tell you that I told a every Republican candidate for governor that would listen to me I told them\nIf you do your job if you get elected and do your job you're going to have a real tough time getting re elected because you're going to have to make so many very challenging difficult decisions that\nPeople in your own party are going to be mad at you show 'em\nThe next governor has really got to roll up their sleeves and park the politics I mean part the politics and make the tough choices that's what's got to happen and\nAnd that means uh being able to convince a majority of the legislature to go along with him um you know the legislatures going to mean an awful lot what the next governor can do and and uh so I'm hopeful that\n... has a shot at doing this because he's the only one that's really talking about a plan to make the serious changes\nI saw him in church yesterday\nYeah you know it but if he has a majority Democrat legislature you know he he's he's going to have to go spend the spin the bottle with them and\nBut if he has a majority democratic legislature you know he he's he's gonna have to go spend the spin the bottle with them\nAnd that's not gonna work 'cause we're just going to postpone the getting kicked the can down the road that's all we've done I've been there ten years or in the state Senate\n... and we just keep kicking the can down the road it was only in the last year that we were able to get some some substantive structural changes the way budgets are handled in the state of Connecticut but um you know he's got to have some votes in the legislature and make this after\nWell we've got to have somebody who will have a profile in\nCourage will come in to do the job and not worry about whether he's going to win again or not\n[noise] ah I I I agree with you wholeheartedly it's a tough choices have to be made and uh um you know we're hopeful that\nYou know this was the guy that can do it um I I Believe he is he's he's talking about the right ideas you know his opponent or another person that's you know talking about things that\nAre going to cost all kinds of money I Know I mean I don't\nUnderstand how anybody could even be thinking about spending more money in in this environment and the state of Connecticut or ... ... we can't pay the bills we have now I'm In you know the teachers are upset because their pension plan is a\nA a you know they're worried about their pension plan B. in front of the the state employees were promised a rosy picture for the rest of their lives and you know now that the payments due for their pension plan and and\nWe don't have the money for it so how can you talk about spending more money when you can't even pay the bills you've already promised ah so that's that's what this next governor it's got to deal with than it is a huge huge challenge\nWell again I appreciate all the time that you join me and we've been

Amy good morning or good morning\nOr good morning good morning Brad how are you today\nHer mentor you Amy good morning good morning\nOr good morning good morning Brad how are you today well I'm doing very well thanks for asking\nI'm feeling pretty good it is true that uh the gas is dropping under three dollars a gallon for the first time in months\nThat's correct gas prices have dropped below three dollars a gallon the average price of gas across Connecticut\nUp for the first time probably since about the middle of may I think it was male eleventh or so\nOr the gas prices jumped up above three dollars a gallon and um you know it's been a real interesting year in terms of gas prices I don't mean that in a good way we've seen gas prices higher than they've been since two thousand fourteen and this year one of the oddities as that typically after\nLabor Day we see gas prices drop off we switch over the refineries switch over to a cheaper winter blend of gasoline\nAnd of course demand drops off from the summertime hide but this year we have not seen that gas prices have remained high because of high price of\nCrude oil that's mostly the reason and they've remained high so we've just started to see the drop all happened within the last week or so and\nUnfortunately AAA does not expect that drop off to continue\nUm with the upcoming midterm elections and the uncertainty around Iran sanctions we expect that the drop off will continue for maybe another week or so and then we're going to see it start to go up a little bit again\nWhy would why would the elections have anything to do with it\nWhile the uncertainty around the elections that has an impact\nA geo political impact and so\nUm you know it it may affect demand is well there are a combination of factors that go into it um that make people change their ... their their confidence consumer confidence and all of those factors come into play\nWell I'll tell you Amy are you guys you know something would I appreciate and I say this to you personally that every\nTime and this has been wonderful I'm good during the above\nThose folks who listen to me that we can help them and every time I have you on this is the reason I like you to call me when ever you feel there is an opportunity that you know you just call me yourself to gift designed because I've heard from my listeners and uh\nThey they really do they see Brad do you know gosh it's only a couple of cents\nFor so long that it's something\nYeah gas prices have really been um you know hurting some people this year without a doubt I Need to remain up above three dollars for as long as they have been has been\nA definitely difficult for a number of people the good news is that the economy is good and consumer confidence is pretty strong so\nWe didn't really see it affect the numbers in terms of travel certainly not over the summer Memorial Day Labor Day and we're taking a look at our Thanksgiving travel numbers\nWhich are not out yet but it will be interesting to see how gas prices potentially affect those numbers since well\nWell again it's a it's a big help a Amy and let's just keep our keep our fingers crossed but you know isn't it ironic every time\nThings go down for people when they go shopping and mission is it just travels right on down to everything\nThat's right it well it depends exactly what you mean by that but there certainly is you know abroad impact when\nI when I Want to say the broader impact that's what I mean yeah\nYou know what Brad if you don't mind I'm going to hijack our interview just a little bit because I Know you're always open to me giving a little extra information out there go ahead so\nWhile we're talking I just want to remind your listeners that Halloween is Wednesday night and we're concerned because he got all these little goals and goblins running around distracted by their the potential for candy and\nThis year it intersects with commuters also anxious to get home a right as\nThe sun is going down so we just want to remind drivers to be on the lookout for the little goals and goblins according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control children or four times as likely to get struck by a car on our way\nReally really an important message to get out there especially this year when it falls right it's\nBy a car on our way really really\nAn important message to get out there especially this year when it falls right in the middle of the week like that and parents make sure that your kids can see out of their math or paint their faces instead put reflective stuff on their costumes make sure they can see and be seen\nWhat is it presented ... what is the percentage again a Amy\nYogurt or four times as likely to be hit by a vehicle on Halloween as any other day of the year in fact\nLast year in Connecticut I was looking at some of the Yukon crashed outta there were ten ... strong fortunately none of them said early and we don't know that those crashes were related to Halloween but three of them including children so it's just a\nIt's kind of a dangerous time of year anyway because the days are shorter\nBills expenses catastrophic cases of medical intervention or it's stressful it's anxiety producing a ... and it's it's some of the biggest crises and so we stand with each other emotionally and spiritually and financially so that we're paying each other's bills at the same time\nDale ... special gas or again today national spokesperson for liberty health share how many customers I well you know I think about this every time I Know I'm going to talk with you how many how many customers do you have nationwide\nWell we have two hundred and forty thousand members in all fifty states allow a ... and uh we're unlimited no limitations in terms of where we can function and operate even internationally or we have members in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands et cetera\nOr as well as folks who live overseas or because we're not insurance we're not limited to national boundaries are and medical expenses occur everywhere\nAnd so we we simply share and those costs are by way of the Internet we throw in technology are but we just simply utilize the time\nProven long time tested a principle of mutual support of mutual aid were there for each other\nYou know Dale at how did something get this is a fabulous program how how did this start\nWell it it's really the way bread a health care bills were paid long before the advent of modern insurance and so it is a long\nA a tradition how\nChristians have helped each other individuals have been assisted in their local communities by the local church or\nNeighbors or community center whenever we would have a bill or the community would gather around and support and care for one another pay that bill support the family we've simply taken that tradition\nAnd turned it into a solution for healthcare modern technology use of the Internet AH Software solutions et cetera\nUh but ... now we've taken that principle of neighbor helping neighbor uh and used it to solve the healthcare crisis\nAnd what are we talking when we talk about money\nWell we break it up according to household size so we ask a single to set aside two hundred and Ninety nine dollars a couple would be three Ninety nine and a family of three or more we don't count more than three so mom dad all kids\nIs five twenty nine and that's the amount of money that would go into that person's online account the share box but then his match to another person uh and and then their bills would be shared in the same fashion\nA but our members tell us it's about fifty percent less than what they ordinarily would be spending if they were using a a secular healthcare plan\nI tell ya ah it it\nI haven't seen figures but I can just hear the words and I know what some figures are and my God it's so much less I mean seriously and I know I'm I'm I'm going on something that's in my head right now and I know what I'm Talking about\nWell there's three reasons for that frankly bread one is it's our money it's not some third party company like an insurance company who holds\nReasons for that frankly bread one is it's our money it's not some third\nParty company like an insurance company who holds those dollars and disperse Islam based upon their priorities it's our dollars at stake so I'm standing at the counter making decisions about the\nCare of my health which is exactly what should be the focus uh I'm I'm eliminating unnecessary care I'm asking questions about the costs are\n... and ... and really reviewing that treatment plan because it's my money and the\n... and the pockets of my fellow members at stake and frankly that just changes the whole mentality\nOf consumption or the second\nA principal for or a factor is we do secured deep discounts in the marketplace for our members so that what a hospital light bill will resolve and settled for sixty percent less than what's build a and then third ah it it is a matter\nOf health focus health concentration it's our\nHealth care it's it's the care of our health so were helpful where health conscious doesn't mean we're all healthy were on that path a button that health awareness and consciousness uh is what creates prevention a ... and a ... an action\nIn advance so that I'm eating right exercising a reducing stress sleeping right all of those kinds of focus about the care of our health\nWell I Know that some of my listeners are on this and this is a this is something when you first called me and it was quite a while ago are at first you say wow is this for real [laughter]\nYou know for sure when you compare it with with what you wish you really get generally and ah it's for real All right\nIt is in it is indeed and it's a growing movement across America or we're adding two to three thousand families or every month a ... and is just continuing to grow as a a solution in the grass roots are for meeting healthcare costs\nAnd again this uh this started was with people like yourself and it just spread and and I can you do something and you can once I started talking with you after this the second time that I talked with you\nAre in and started to hear from some of the listeners\nAnd uh you know it it just fell right into place for him\nWell it really is because isn't it the way America believes that and operates and lives their lives but frankly Brad we are the most generous people\nOn the globe whenever there's a natural disaster people come from all over the country to help those folks are\nWhenever a child falls into the war well we collectively hold our breath until that child's rescued miners are trapped in a mine and earth moving equipment comes from everywhere that's really the way we behave and operate a and we're simply building on those principles of neighbor helping neighbor\nUh in this case member helping member a and it succeeds up because that's in our DNA\nNow\nThe folks that are listening and doing something like this for the first time they're thinking about it what do they do\nBest best is to just simply go to our website\nUh liberty health

I'm not saying I'm we have a we have very very strong leadership in this city is leaving values not just Jewish value is leaving values and those are not the values of his friends and that's\nAnd I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nOr the current event that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I said as the June the Jews are out to lunch with these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first one to be attacked\n... Donald Trump ... ah you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn on MSNBC the other day\nA on that and the code well is that a panel it rescinded there were four people on the panel that was the Trump and said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked that adults Hitler why because they were and every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell actually no I chose this measure the any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who coined nationalism\nIs a Democrat they just will find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC he said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist\nIt's white and then that translates into Hitler\nThey have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump this guy is actually funny it is a tax I'm a ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a put these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continued to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time since Abraham Lincoln at the

they're only goal is to bring this president down and they're going to take\nThe most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\n... they're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president who has done so much to restore American the credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and\nActually had the guts to go and follow through to make Jerusalem of the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge\nBut ... they will find any way to pick at President Trump ... fortunately in West Virginia has been Trump has a lot of support\nHe won the election by forty two points when I get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda and separately the reason why people were fleeing from Joe ...\nIs he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is really slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some price of Hillary and Obama but ... is not\nPro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nNatural supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all is that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said\nWe're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record\nNot his rhetoric because lower when he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion they move away from them so it's an educational process\n... ... what about the um issues of just basic fairness that we\nAnd so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of\nJust basic fairness that we saw a rise after the Kavanaugh I'm hearing is Joe Manchin a voted for cabin on the end but a man that I think most people just saw that as just an\nExample of rank unfairness and trading some ... trading someone who is accused as you know they were guilty just because they were accused\nWhat's it that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back to the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the capital of West Virginia should cast a vote there should be the leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for having all\nWe know that Feinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided in the bed it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used that's\nWhat the problem is a guy like Joe mansion though he may appear to be more moderate rhetoric but in reality when you're first quote is to empower these radicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president\nDecided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life and yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw it but just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia but start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition to defeat Obama's coal killing rights at the U.S Supreme Court but that due to serve as a bridge\nTo President Trump and then he follow through on his promises which were on some of those crazy unlawful rules and that's putting some miners back to work now what we have a long way to go but\nYou're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that the Trump tax cuts\nAre very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering the rates\nBut in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always which are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's huge and that's a credit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he\nKind of goes back and forth and say well he was open than he wasn't the reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for and that's not the kind of leadership when he but we are seeing a resurgence in West Virginia and you have to give this person a credit for so many of the good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on\nPicking rule of law judges that\nInstills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nA we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next to seven days election day

the fan and think he probably on your show\nCertainly thank you how can I help [noise] okay [noise] so\nI've been following your plan for around like a couple of months now I had the emergency fines and I'm working I babysat too good on my issue and I have made progress not a ton of Iraq I found out that\nI'm not an issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I Am not letting it take over my life is good\nUm my question is is how do I I check 'em for my deductible nominate ... recently I recently switched health plans to stop the most started again I'm\nNot a chronic illness you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight um\nIt's ... thank God it's nothing on the go it it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it while every year\nNow okay so now I don't look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that Iran is a it's a nerve pain condition and the doctors are unsure of war comes I'm okay um so it was over there but I Want to do is I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nFor what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with this the better your estimates her body because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months\nYou're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand though the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a a whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ... medical or just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and\nThe money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime\nOf this or something I Hope not yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable or that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future\nAnd so so much for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been doing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really are likely to right now\nOn what I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we going to get in your memory at an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where you are\nI don't have that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that\nI made I don't think a lot I'm a licensed social worker and because of my condition axis which type job I had more ...\nOn some at a fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred to Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck um\nI knew he gotta twice a month on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them and I get them\nUm I knew he'd had twice a month on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nAnd I guess I'm I'm living with a very late I pay nine Seventy five around each other life for a lot um and I do that somehow from ...\n... and what is the nature of the bed student loan\nPratt is everything credit card I often because they can has announced trying a lot of holistic thing mhm I'm not at all and then the student loan it and most of that is right in a trip to tap into that I haven't the total fix the thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food\nPantry not eating not eating out for you and you're paying more than half\nYour life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food children's clothing and transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense that he\nSaid he was only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as a end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nYou're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah I mean declaring it I'm saying ... actually I've I've got an ongoing medical how do I prepare\nFor it you save uncover it so now that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would begin to look at it get take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you can you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but ah we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is Tom for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nBall Leonardo why I'm going through baby sit out the right now I'm In fact we just paid off by that getting credit card today though we are done like credit card and moving on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working to pay that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\n'cause we want to ... and ... percent and um I ... that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can give later\nOn on what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of I ... I Want to get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent by it but we want to tie without thinking about it and bought up and giving back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um\nOther charitable organization that we believe in that are about doing day or a ... you know doing the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who have needed um but and she's on the other hand wants to try and present a church and then\nYou are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it won't be charged him we had a big argument about either in yesterday's was\nOut of it as long as you know the the definition of\nDies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tamp it doesn't mean that doesn't mean twenty of it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we have an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter I'm looking for what God's has to do in his love letter to me\nAnd he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm\nAbout you I Love ya\nAnd um you can give are not given all still love you but the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a ties a tenth of your income even\nYeah and all throughout the Old Testament\nAnd Jesus reaffirmed within the New Testament is a tie a tenth of your income evangelicals have taught and believed for Fifteen hundred years\nThat that private is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise] so if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical lots of your wife was argumentative she was correct biblical\n[laughter] actually both are probably turn red\nGood luck with that brother [laughter]\n[noise]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\n[noise] um no I was just calling in today 'cause I I've been listening to for about a year I'm On an off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand in cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars yes it is because the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year\nWhere did you used amount of the old drum\nYeah that that's what I was making before um [noise] yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March in June ...

I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good\nIt's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now but here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there all ending or clothing\nYes and and like I told her she she worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed those signatures\nTo ... three weeks from now here I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would do I would not sell her car today I Would show your trial today and I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous\nPhilosophy that she has all the ... I'm not putting up with that crap\nOkay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you\nAnd I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget that has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven dollars an hour for the bet a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then you're not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside of enemy that has come at your house\nAnd instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage\nProblem [noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around and started selling mama's car is not way good way get mom on

I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat kind of oil and gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\n\n\nThanks for joining us America we're glad\nWith us for like five five five Andy I'm Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by\nBecause there was a neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you\nHave an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question we do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs in ... in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n[noise] the camp will be a the\nThe operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that had his own\nOwn own will be rented or on we currently own property currently on that property and we'll be living on it also\nWrote to him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a you know\nNeed to get with insurance broker and what kind of our insurance as appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the turn of the good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or you are ... separate from the nonprofit lack company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you get\nProfit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so well let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on their hands at the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separate uh and so treat that you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and so treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to the state farm and get an airplane insurance okay then we'll salad or they might but you wouldn't want to buy their even if they did so you you said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that ... policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much in this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and they cause this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in his shoes as it but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight anything of this um\n[noise] no ... yeah they carry weight but um\nThey eat and\nThere are no agreements they keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that\nOr you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but a whole harmless as\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you on hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his honor and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and thanks for the call\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five at two to five you're

are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a question and I'm a new American I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on a lot\nI'm new to the baby step and I know that number one than the thousand dollar an emergency find my question in the you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years honor never happened I mean really lucky we've never been laid off I don't think you have and they get home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so uh\nYou know if he looks up in five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push paws on one of the makeup of every step thing and this pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com\nAnd then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step forward and I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that if they're matching and don't think they do but if they're matching\nYou on the ... going to start their with Iraq with the match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate is going to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey while I was\nA one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary rap for them or in path any other debt also that I have\nOh I'm not sure that that if you got\nTo give to cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nBecause your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on bald each or total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you know a lot of car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what are you on the rental\nMy primary I ought to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and um my rent Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has work to be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we stay taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nThey um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go and pay off the rental\nUm my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing more forty fifty grand a year and that stuff let's see here we got\nThree four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car I'm ordering soul rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had in question whether to to do that and and pay off more the party much ... pretty much all my dad yeah the um but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college I don't know how house payment you can catch them\nRight okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit cards are cut up there and they tell me Gary by a car you pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do that because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight up the planet you can get on track\nYou know you can't sort or ride this out of the horse\nIt doesn't work in a shorter routed me got to ride him or not and so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college now say about ... mission where the rentals with cash or go along out there in the future and I think ten years from the day you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff\nThat you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah I'd dump the rental and pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered um by just don't want to start in a savings account was a junior college junior colleges do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then I'm a ... then once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way\nBut we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ...

and I'm I'm Glad you're attacking this it's going to work for you\nDebbie is with us from Anchorage, Alaska Hi Debbie welcome to the day ramps you show\n\n\nJoining\nYou are here over the photos of Tripoli eight to five five ... five books as whether some Pensacola, Florida Hi Brookes welcome Ramsey show I said how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nSo much for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a station out there uh we have a a courthouse here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally\nFor taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a ... station out there or we have to pay for house here in Pensacola and um [noise] I Know you normally say not to buy a house if you're in the military\nUm but I've made good money last two times I've done it and uh I Am uncomfortable having my whole network and um [noise] in the stock market basically 'cause we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and Fifteen came retirement already and [noise]\nAnd I would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there in San Diego so you know I don't want everything in the stock market also don't want everything in one house specific but I'm only going to leave their short time and I wanted to know your buddy [noise]\n\nUm I don't have a problem with and not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nYou know sort of a we have it on the market I I I Am going to cash out of this now isn't really they're gonna by how well they sell for New Orleans out three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up my non retirement investments are you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something out there\nWith how much do you have in non retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement talking about a half million dollar house then his or her what's your household income or about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell so you've got your duck in it and you lose money on it\nIn some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially\nUm I'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego and that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement [noise]\nUm or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that I was having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nA non retirement cash and money from this other home and it goes up to seven hundred and when your salad\nYou're probably next move moving to a cheaper market there's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego that's about the ... I mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay by\nA there's a couple of other main there there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that\nSo if you make some money and you're there are three years and you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does\nThat make sense yes or the so it's not\nReally a permanent decision even if you use all your non ... retirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something in the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds\nLeaving me with some cash and non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all\nAnd I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing\nFrom a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long you're not going to be there ten years and if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years um but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different\nExpense of real estate in the next next location that your station\nBut if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nKnow how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm trying to figure out how not to be climbing under or does it went on ... years old but ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you know how how do I start or retirement and I guess I\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of that and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money\nFreed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA and down around a lot of average probably right about a thousand only\nOkay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay if and how old are you I'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt you know good for you are you single now OK okay does your wife or gosh I Am the idea that marriage what does she may\nOr read about Seventy\nOkay All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund\nAnd then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement\nAnd that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a four oh three B or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office\nYou would put some money there especially if there's a match and then you both need to do a raw IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else or do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stock mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in

and our first student loans\nIn some countries that yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us and we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling to show how much\nOf the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years or brothers or the last year or so last year the incomes doubled right Israel guy and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... broke I live in the last year or kicked in about the time you saw the light of the total income comes up ... yeah I mean yeah what what was the hardest part of this for you all cause six and a half\nAnd a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan\nUm that was just such a victory feeling for us um so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money to flow out wherever and to really narrowing down a budget and during the envelope system and that was hard for me to the\nYou know think for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying the nice things and I'm just constantly you know tall yourselves that will be later you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nHas been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else in a really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free you know those are the ... last three hundred pounds it really does and he has a lot of that yeah it's pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of a soccer ball was worth it is or is that it was four years ago back into\nNo no no no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow I'm we're on baby step for well at the beginning steps to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow from an event\nLive or no not say that but it was during the ...\nChanges you're going through his good good for you guys like well congratulations to you have more cheerleaders are more detractors as you went along um we had a lot of\nCheerleaders yeah we were and really you know supported by her family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and hanging off dead it was kind of just people were in this belief that we were able to pay off so much and um and at the same time to one of the big things for us with our journey was\nUm being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and things like that but we also wanted to still I'm available lord in use our money for him and so I'm a lot is you know for the first few years a lot of money was going out not towards that end we felt okay with that\nAnd so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step to even if it's a huge lump sound because the lord bless us and so many ways when we um\nI mean we've had both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another

dispute that will always exist I suspect but they had [noise]\nSome kind of a protection inside the temple or\nMaybe you could have been a very much different situations\nSo a couple of comments there you know he's not incorrect now it troubles me we shouldn't be in a situation where we need armed guards or police officers who are serving as security guards are we shouldn't have\nTo be that way but in some circumstances obviously it does I mean you look at the the Amy church in Charleston South Carolina and you look I mean that was not during services that was a an after\nHours event that was

and what he said that\nIf there were all armed guards or if there was security inside that things could have been different though he's he's right it's just the timing of the statement that he's also

to\nIf I'm not mistaken bring your firearm into\nThese services and the thoughts are that if there is a problem you're gonna have\nPotentially arm parishioners or audio\nThose that attend these houses of worship that might be able to neutralize or mitigate the situation and again\nI Would rather have a fighting chance I Would rather have the ability to potentially neutralize a maniacal sick a

she's quite the artist we have\nA very very nice photography anyway I just have go ahead [noise]\n[noise] yeah and you know as far as Trump leading them so wide open for the last you know he's really manipulative is not stupid and all the other slander that drought is way she's actually drawing them out so they show the true colors she they really are and he's doing that for the population to be able to see\nThe remnants of hatred and invented the mess because they always weigh over react\nYou know I voted for Trump and up front I had some real questions you know concerns about that but I tell you why I voted for Trump\nYou don't send a preacher to a gun fight cinder gunfighter to a gunfight so I can overlook is ruffles edges and sometimes as blatant um remarks that he makes because he's exactly what we need to get the writer of the ship of America turned district in this country back out\nAnd I was I give Trump on credit I'm not as gung ho you as you are on some of the issues as far as his timing his intent I don't always believe that everything is a three chess moves ahead\nOn one he says and does I think sometimes he does step in it because that's just his personality to just get on the bulldozer and just ram and\nThat's what Trump has always done hey I just have thanks for the call I appreciate it let's roll to ease Chester New York Tom you're on Smith high\nYeah hey ... thanks for taking my call a\nRegard to Trump in the media just want to say really quickly that\nA President Trump could walk on water and the next day the headlines would say that Trump can't swim so that that that's what I Want to say about the media but\nLast week Lewis fabric and was on TV before issued this was last week and he was asked about if he was an anti Semite and his right why was that guy ... his\n... was that the anti termites\nYes and that was his reply anti he was anti termites and I thought and most of my friends here to ever all my friends that I spoke to every here in New York and all our prayers for the people in Pittsburgh the families of victims everything but with Louis fiery can I\nI heard nothing today about why do why does have some like tough reporter like Anderson Cooper going put a microphone in his face today and ask him hey how do you feel about what happened the other day in Pittsburgh where all these tough macho reporters\nGoing into his face putting him on TV today\nAnd and they'll never do that they'll never do and what he thought it was disgusting and this was prior to the shooting today with the fall I like to hear well ... comments want his thoughts are on what happened to these people I just watched ... and the news conference\nHold on a woman Tom ... only answer let me just interject quickly first goal when Farrah Khan made the comment the anti termites anti Semite when he delivered that horrific rhetoric\nRight the coverage was not very heavy I saw it on a new more sites I saw it on a couple of mainstream sites but it really didn't get the kind of play that\nIt should have gotten and I'm a I'm going to throw it out there these athletes\nIf a a Jew or Christian had said something similar about Muslims I think that that would have gotten more play in the media so a hundred percent agree Tom\nThat story was it was an buried but it really wasn't covered the way that it should've been covered Lewis Farrah Khan is a disgusting anti Semitic vigil\nAnd I have talked about Louis Farrakhan and lie or disregard for anything that he's involved with the fact that I had his number and many Americans have had is number we've talked about him as\nConditions warranted as stories have come up ah we've talked about Sarah count on the show listen I was disgusted I pointed out it was when the the Aretha Franklin fuel\nThat Louis Farrakhan was was at the funeral and he was on television and in in in print photos what the hell I don't know what a Aretha Franklin's family was thinking having\nLewis ferrets I don't want to give this guy by the time of day I don't want to legitimize anything to do with Louis Farrakhan and\nAnd I'll tell you what a time I'll tell you what\nI Would like to see and and your your your spot on I Would love to see a mainstream reporter or one of the night time pundits somebody should and you're right corner Louis Farrakhan and lets a listener response\nOr one of the nighttime pundits somebody should and you're right corner Louis Farrakhan and lets a listener response wasn't what he has to say if he was just point blank ask\nSo are your thoughts on this massacre of the Jews at this Pittsburgh synagogues on Saturday you know how when Louis Farrakhan react\nThat that would be that would be fascinating and I think that is a very very good observation Tom what else did you have\nNo that's all I just like I said I as a sort of Sarah Sanders today in the news comes in the media went right after President Trump and I'm like you know here's a story that should be covered with fabric and they should give him the coverage and like you just said and I said\nPut her right so what do you think about what happened Saturday you proud of that do you think that's good I mean put it right to them and put it right on television but they don't have the guts to do with the mainstream media\nThey don't have great observation time and I wish somebody would will watch and if they do\nA we'll talk about hey you don't want a film saving get all the ... ... saving call his office or whoever the hell answers his phone maybe it won't try to see if we can get Farrah Khan on the phone and ask him what he thinks that's a good idea Tom you're spot on he also\nWith the anti Semite anti term I comment that Farrah Khan made I Want to get the exact store and get the exact verbiage but Twitter less than up\nThere is other hate speech or other anti religious group or what what's deemed to be have for hate speech that Twitter has removed but to the best of my recollection Twitter\nDid not remove that that remains I Want to dig up the story and what a refresh my memory but I'll get to that I hear shortly let's go to Hartford, Connecticut Greg you're next on the program welcome to Schmidt hike\nBoy do I agree with the previous caller it's about time that we we'd call somebody out on their beliefs like that shit I'm really concerned that we got another Scott Peterson situation and I may be completely wrong but this is what happens\nAt least now in twenty Eighteen when you arrived on scene and you hear gunfire and a building and and hopefully your with with another officer you run into the building you go on a building knowing that either you or your fellow officer will be killed by that person but then you can kill that other person\nI mean that that's that's the way it goes down did that happen like that how can you how can you possibly get to a point where you could take that man alive if that's the protocol that you used\nWell ah the fact is is that officers did go in I don't we don't have\nA complete operational breakdown of exactly what happened\nWhen they entered I noticed the nine one one coal first rolled in at nine fifty four AM on Saturday morning the cops are on the scene pretty quickly we know that\nFor police officers were shot so that was engagement so they weren't in a ... I I heard ... I don't dig it up um I probably for our number to some of the the police radio audio of I Would imagine\nA SWAT Team members or you know initially it takes a while for the SWAT Team in some cases they get assembled and get there so it's your officers who are typically on the regular the patrol that would enter and go in but we we certainly had\nOne also for officer shot and one is still in critical condition so they they clearly engaged with the suspect\nOccasion that there is no time to wait for a SWAT Team at twenty Eighteen oh man that's a long lasting I Want to media\nRight absolutely you go in and clearly that's what happened I mean some of the officers did go in but let me be clear I\nHave not seen or I don't have I haven't found yet or if it's out there to see if we can find something soon my executive producer on a timeline on who went in for us I don't know if if the Pittsburgh Police the point I I haven't seen it but I if I can find that and\nIf it becomes available the study who went in but it does appear that Pittsburgh Police went in and they put their lives in danger trying to neutralize the shooter and protect the congregation\nWell the only scenario where he could have come out alive is if they'd gone and the man had his weapon on the ground and a chance up otherwise if you come in and he has a gun in his hand and you know that there's been rounds fired you take him out first because you don't know if he's one of many you take him out and move on I just don't see that happening\nYour concern is that what your question is why wasn't taken alive he was he had he did have gunshots he was treated at the hospital in fact in just a minute I'm going to play some audio ah incredible the doctors and nurses working on ... hours\nIn fact you're just a minute I'm a play some audio ah incredible\nThe doctors and nurses working on ... hours to shop the Jews at the Pentagon they were working on 'em in the hospital while he was still spouting anti Semitic bourbon so we'll get to that coming up and just\nConnecticut needs to be more affordable when you do your job and you ... the state has tremendous potential if we can work together we can turns around me drawing legislators employers to help students and\nIt's time to fix Connecticut learned more ethics Connecticut dot com\nMethods friends ...\nThis is ... is director of public affairs jumbo cat did you know hundreds of Connecticut medical professionals serve with Doctors Without borders delivering emergency medical care what the needs are greatest Doctors Without borders and saving a life somewhere right now find out more Doctors Without borders dot org\n[noise] breaking down the walls of liberalism Bush Savage Nation heard only on the talk of Connecticut every weekday at three PM till the our sci am WBRC F.

this type of Twitter activity especially under the microscope especially since we've had\nThe pipe bombs from last week the synagogue shooting from Saturday morning\nThe president this morning in his first sleep\nThis was ... see what time was this a while he had to hit the actually three tweets I Want to go over because the one this morning rolled out at eight o three am but about twelve hours earlier\nIn the eight o'clock hour last night so Sunday night the president tweeted the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country\nActually it is they're fake and dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand\nI I just I don't know why any president needs to engage on this level at eight wells or so on a Sunday night that the put out that kind of tweak\nThem it continued this morning and this was at a you know three am\nThe president tweeted there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even for George reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame\nAnd then a lip sees dot dot dot then it continues of anger so that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must and [noise] you know I just the the and I was saying the the the ramble look the constant resuscitation of the fake news must stop he he's done this on dozens of occasions\nMany many occasions and it's just the same thing over and over again it's it's almost like a you know hit like a head ruling Harry here\nAh you know an enough is the president's top it already [noise] uh\nIs from a guy that's on your side for the most part policy wise but I don't want to see garbage like this silly tweets and the fake news and the enemy of the people\nAnd they clearly it makes them feel better that cancer's endorphins rushing him and he feels like he's been slighted or he's been hammered for whatever reason he feels good when he puts the squeeze out the fifty five million followers and I'm Sorry I just don't\nFor whatever reason he feels good when he puts the squeeze out the fifty five million followers\nAnd I'm Sorry I just don't think a president should operate that way and I'm not going to sit here and say\nEverything he does is fine because it's not plenty of all he does is okay plenty of all he does like light policy but enough already with these tweets it's almost like you know there's a mental disorder with these tweets over and over again\nAnd then the fake news we just had the pipe bomb incident with the media was targeted members of Congress are targeted\nAnd then the safe fake news and then to qualify that the fake news that the enemy of the people but then we know who he calls fake news so essentially the telegraphing there is that CNN and\nNBC and the New York times those any calls the fake news that they are the enemy of the people I'm so there's no way to sugarcoat\nThis [noise] just stop it Mr President stop [noise]\nDo give them the ability to go after you even further I don't want to comment on this but I'm not going to stick my head up by but
