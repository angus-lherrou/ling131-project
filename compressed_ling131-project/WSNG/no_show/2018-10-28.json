last week you heard a a very special invitation\nTo an event that happened or as we play this program or if it happened last weekend in orange\nAre benefiting transitions mentoring program at mansion you Institute in Cheshire uh a program of family re entry which helps young men aged fourteen to twenty two uh the transitions program particularly helps young men fourteen to twenty to transition from incarceration back into the community\nUh family re entry really has a multifaceted uh and now almost three decades old program a long long before the\nIdea of a second chance community was a glimmer in the eye of the outgoing governor I'm a ... a ... a family reentry recognized\nThat there were a\nProven Ways to ensure folks who are transitioning I've incarceration would be able to enjoy a success in their communities success in their work success with their families are and uh\nWe're celebrating that and the second half of the program a first by a checking in one more\nTime with a John nearly who is a a cofounder of the transition mentoring program along with diet McKnight a and a will be meeting just roll Vazquez who was part of that program\nUm who has benefited from it and as a made a decision to stay with it as a mentor or as someone who's going to be going in and talking to these young men and showing them through his own example uh how he is making a difference and making the changes he needs to make so I'm first John ah if\nFolks in a world listening to us last week give us a quick\nBackground on a family re entry and how the transitions program fits into that\n... is a organization that's been around since Nineteen eighty four eighty five and they're\nTransitions program fits into that\nWell family reentry is a organization that's been around since Nineteen eighty four eighty five\nAnd they're a mission statement is all based on a helping people that are being released from incarceration to transition them back into the community\nIn the best possible way so that they stay in the community and become a part of the solution instead of that of the problem they have a there's a leading a a organization in this field and they've been ah um\nAcknowledge for that over the years and mentoring transition has been around since about two thousand and I've been involved since two thousand five in what we do there\nUm is the uh helping of the youth fourteen to twenty two\nUm we work with them inside we have volunteer mentors that get involved in their lives in and also out and we continue the guidance and support and bring opportunities lumped through their incarceration and most importantly when they're released\nUm and we've witnessed many success stories as you will hear from judges role in a moment I'm sure\nYes and um uh what's important for folks to know is although they missed the event that we talked about on the first to have our program last weekend [noise] uh it's it's important for them to know that the program still need support because the state of Connecticut was providing some ... some subsidy for this for a period of time\nBut several years ago along with a number of other support programs or the fat funding ended but the program has continued it's been successful and flourish even though it has not had the state support and that is on the strength of the belief that private funders have right\nYes um we have been um cell funding this program for a few years um and it's based on people are that have been involved that are no of the work that we do um know young men uh gotten out and been in their community and doing the work\nI'm In the last couple of minutes we have just tell people I'm a little bit about what your experiences are and why it's so important to put more people like ah just Raul Vasquez\nA back out industry in the right place to do the kinds of things that he is a committed and pledging to do\n[noise] um I I just wanted to see a a thank you for having and I'm and I'm you know John John nearly um he really spearheaded this program I've just been assistant and when it for the past uh nine years I Believe\nAnd it's been a joy to be a part of a just to see the progress of the young men who often or more times than not we really don't even know that they have all the options besides it kind of activities and they'd be ... that had been engaging in\nBecause of you know they have it as something that's just been learned behavior or in the environment and um because of different things going on as far as poverty frustration ignorance lack of education or which for the most part it's not their fault and it goes out to the ground there planted ...\nAbsolutely um so um to me I think especially at a crucial time right now in Connecticut even though we are\nSeeing all over the country as a second chance state um to have a second chance state is to um components to that you got to have a pre release part or before the guys get out which the commission or in a government have done a great job\nBut where the governor's lacking as when he cut the budget for re entry programs on the outpost released side\nDo supportive services are very important so becoming a part of the team and joining us in partnership or whether it's through money what this to volunteering\nTo help uh keep providing these young men was stability in a positive support network when they get out is very important at a time where that's not being provided by there's no reentry fund in um for community programs in the community to provide these resources on so\nI think now is really an opportune time for people to come together and say hey you know um they did what they did they cut the budget but as a community led a step up to the plate come together and see how we can be creative to create opportunities and resources for these young men um if you want to reduce crime\nWe got to increase a reentry resources um that is very important I'm just looking at the statistics\nRight now I Believe a mess and you've institution which is a they take guys ranging from ages fourteen to twenty to Twenty one I'm at one time they they held\nThe Mason use institution which is a they take guys ranging from ages fourteen to twenty to Twenty one I'm at one time they they held more but now they're down to three hundred and sixty something people I Believe\nBut that's a direct result of when they had those community programs in place that provides support resources so now that those things have disappeared if we don't be creative to continue to provide those kinds of support resources on the outside you can see that number go back on\n... and as a John pointed out and we talked about in the first segment of the program that played prior to the event [noise] um [noise]\nUh you know Connecticut is as you pointed out no now nationally and I dare say even globally for a second chance to society a\nBy family re entry a ... and and the successor that second chance society may not have ever happened or happened as quickly or as well if it hadn't been for the nationally known work that family re entry as as Don decades\nBefore or the governor introduced the second chance society initiatives here in Connecticut so uh it's important\nFor people to learn more about this program a and the way that they wrap these are incarcerated individuals in support and education and a peer to peer uh information and interaction as well as using Scientifically Proven\nUp programs and you know using science also to help uh\nAchieve the goals that is helping Connecticut close prisons and getting more and more people who are incarcerated a back into a productive\nTax paying members of society folks like um I guess this morning just roll ... has been going into special education or just about to transition into a central Connecticut State University\nA just a an inspiring a story and uh so glad to meet you just roll and we're going to be than we are going to be coming back on the radio or with me a bunch of times I can tell you as long as I got the microphone so my guess this morning just roll Vasquez a who is the beneficiary\nOf the family re entry transitions mentoring program when he was a mansion youth Institute of my longtime friend John merely a\nAre a kind of about this whole transitions thing kicked off and my my new friend I McKnight a who is co creator and supporter of the transitions program once again go to family re entry dot org to learn more about it and gentleman a best of\nLuck and thank you all for me to me today that I used to have it as I say ...\n\nWell the topic of discussion in this segment is going to be on a not only how you're keeping well at home\nBut the interest that your employer or will likely have and making sure they're keeping you well and\nTo talk about wellness at work were bringing in a brand new friend to the award winning for the people uh Roberta walk till ... is senior vice president and chief sales and marketing officer at kinetic care or she is going to let us call her Bert for the remainder of the program a Burt welcome thanks for joining us\nThanks John gray hair\nSo as we sort of alluded to in our brief introduction wellness is really a becoming a not just important to the employee but to the employer as well right\nYeah it is you know everyone who's running a business in the state of Connecticut is concerned about health care costs on the rise\nOr the portability of health care for their employees and they're looking for solutions like wellness programs to keep people healthy and out of the hospital in the first place so there's a lot a lot of interest and these types of programs\nAnd and with the of course with the escalating cost not only on the employee but on the employer is well this is ... becoming even more critical and we are starting to see a a lot of businesses and\nNot just these wean quick moving a kind of ... small businesses but huge ah you know sometimes multinational or even global corporations based here in Connecticut I'm moving on to some sort of a a a larger wellness program right\n[noise] yeah it is a growing number of employers of all shapes and sizes are really taking these programs seriously\nAgain as a as a way to keep their workforce healthy so it's really not just the the up and coming start up it is every business certainly have to keep their eye on this uh and and using these types of programs to get a better better result\nAgain you know you keep people how can you keep them on a hospital and I think more and more people over time recognizing\nThat just providing insurance for their employees\nYou keep them out of the hospital and I think more and more people over time recognizing\nThat just providing insurance for their employees is it's a way to help them financially when they get sick but the better answer is to keep them healthy in the first place so there is a lot of emphasis on preventive care\nAnd chronic disease management making sure that people who are diagnosed with that it is a disease and know how to care for themselves once they get diagnosed so a big focus of ah going upstream and making sure that people stay healthy and the first place\nRight and it's not I guess it's not just about making sure you know like little things like giving people a flu shots to make sure that they don't get the flu but it's also about making sure those employees feel are important uh you know feel valued to the point where if they're feeling\nLike they have a cold or or maybe something else that's communicable ... they're they're comfortable ... calling in sick because\nIt's a matter of not spreading it to other employees as well but there there's also the role that businesses are now able to play in a reducing the level of chronic\nIllnesses or things like diabetes because they're bringing in a you know farm to table food and more uh uh fruits and vegetables for snacks the rows of of chipping candy machines and soda machines in the break room are slowly being replaced by a\nBy healthy alternatives\nYes I'm no doubt about it and it it you know some employers who just started out I'm trying to put in a\nA wellness program would start with just that putting healthy snacks and their vending machines [noise] um but there is a growing demand to support these programs not just in\nI'll call it the coverage um and and providing a incentives for doing things like flu shots as you mentioned\nBut really trying to create a culture of wellness so the farm to table making sure that cafeterias have\nHealthy alternatives um and really looking at every aspect of what goes on at the workplace and making sure that there are healthy ... alternatives to making sure someone players like Connecticut actually um we have a a meditation room because we know that stress or in the workplace causes people to\nUm either have to leave for the day or maybe not come in um because of what they're dealing with\nA in their family situation or even dealing with with customers on the phone and so we uh we try to provide for any way that an employee needs to get a little a little refreshing a moment where they can\nWorkforce not painting them all with the same brush and\nReally trying to focus on what is my demographic look like and what are the challenges I have and making sure that\nThe culture of the company supports it um but also making sure it's personalized so that you can actually motivate the different demographic groups that are within an employee population\nSo at Connecticut as an example um we employ a lot of the techniques and tactics that I just spoke about with challenges and gave us occasion but we're really sit down with an employer and say we look at the\nThe data and how are people using the healthcare benefits\nAnd really trying to customize the program for that culture and and what the data would suggest that\nCompany needs um some some companies may be you know they may have employees that are going to the emergency room\nI'm way way too much beyond the the norms of the state and so we'd say what's what's going on here why are people do in the emergency room it's expensive but more importantly\nTrying to really understand what's driving some of these things and then putting solutions in place to really shine a light on um reversing whatever whatever trend is happening in that employees culture players culture\nYeah yeah and as you mentioned a little bit earlier you know companies that have even started with one simple initiative and have a long way to go to even get up to speed with some of the companies that are doing these large scale and very comprehensive and innovators\nOf multi point initiatives but um everybody wants to make the wellness program more successful whether they're just providing a salad bar and the material or this one of these kind of national multi point initiatives\nAnd this is where we learn a little bit of the the the lingo of the industry are and that is the term we bid\nA tell us a little bit about the\nThe ... the ... id stands for valor\nAnd that is the term we bid a tell us a little bit about the\nWii bit the B.

D. stands for value based insurance designs\nAnd this is really a um insurance programs that are focused on um ... on driving folks not driving but in really strongly encouraging folks to utilize care at the right place\nAt the right time in their lives for so for example I'm a value based insurance design would reward for I'm getting preventive screenings that's a really big one making sure that\nSomebody I'm of a certain age ah who is supposed to see their primary care doc once a year\nUm maybe have a mammogram if they're a woman over forty or fifty or the latest national standard making sure they're getting that at the right time\nA colonoscopy every ten years or five if that's what your health profile would suggest and it's and it's rewarding for those kinds of plans and and the reward isn't necessarily just you know giving somebody a gift card the reward would actually be using the insurance plan designed\nTo eliminate any financial barriers to getting these screenings done so for example an employee\nAnd the value based insurance design wouldn't have to pay a co pay or a deductible\nTo get a colonoscopy or mammogram if they were supposed to do that according to their age and gender so it's removing the financial barriers so that people can do the right thing at the right point in their lives I'm getting a flu shot is another example every once you get a flu shot\n'em and so it's removing any kind of financial barrier in the insurance program so that people can get these tests at the most appropriate time so it's called the value based insurance design because the the design of the insurance benefit itself is really geared toward\nGetting people to do the right thing at the right time and the program removes the financial barriers that might be in the way of them doing that when they need to\nThe other really incredible thing about employee wellness program is\nHappens when they bring that wellness knowledge home because one of the other things that can affect productivity and absenteeism in a company is if somebody in the household gets sick\nAnd so I I have to imagine there's a ripple effect when these people come home or you know fired\nUp and inspired seeing the results in themselves and having their loved ones see it so maybe the initiation of ... uh employee a wellness programs are having a great effect or\nWith the loved ones are those employees as well\nOh there's no doubt about it we we actually have a some new programs that we've put\nInto market that are specifically focused on pre diabetes so at and the impact of um these positive changes that have happened to employees really carry through\nTo to home so as an example um it we we have a lot of programs in pre diabetes focused on again eat this not that\nAnd making sure people know their numbers and get educated and a lotta times you know folks don't even know they have pre diabetes it's so prevalent in our society um one out of three of us in the United states has pre diabetes and Ninety percent of us don't even know we have it so the very first step\nIs to start with um would call it health literacy and knowing your numbers and ... and then creating programs that really focus on diet and exercise and once these employees in these programs and in our experience\nThey start to lose weight they start to feel better they start to get educated that\nYou know when they go into restaurants they should be looking for healthy choices will pretty soon the whole family is starting to eat healthier and pretty soon I'm ... on football Sunday they're making a chicken wings that are baked and not fight I mean it's it's little things like this that really start to\nTurn turn people's lifestyle around but they they can't do it by themselves they need they need family and support at home as well\nYou know to bring on the veggies up instead of the jokes and I'm a trainer will will turn this sooner or later well a bird it's been two into such a chat with you but I'm sure there's a bunch of folks out there's a small business owners in large corporate uh uh a jar and\nLeaders who are are listening who want to learn more so um how can they turn to your organization to learn more about uh either initiating or improving a\nEmployee wellness programs\nWhich I wouldn't I Would say\nAnd to learn more about uh either initiating or improving a\nEmployee wellness programs\nBut then I wouldn't I Would suggest that they go directly to a either kinetic hair dot com and find a stare\nOr the or the specialized program that we had inside of Connecticut where they can get more information on wellness programs it's called care management solutions to the site would be W.

consultants\nAnd she's created several health formulas now that are literally helping millions of people out there regain their health and wellness\nAnd Dodger janitor I Want to get right into this and we're talking about pain today and it always amazes me that you know we have the technology to put men on the moon and bring them back again we do and yet we can't seem to get a handle on pain relief ... what's going on\nIn the last time I was here it was estimated that forty three million Americans\nAre dealing with pain in their body just astounding now that number has doubled to an estimated eighty six million American adults and that's why I'm here today I really want to talk to you about this epidemic\nOr what kind of pain are we talking about here all the ... rheumatoid and osteoarthritis ... we got the ... the ten denied us\nWe have fibromyalgia neck pain and low back pain ... hip pain knee pain joint pain and of course we have injuries you know we have a weekend warrior type things too and actually crosses over one hundred different types of pain syndromes\nBut the real issue crafts just we're failing to get to the root cause of the pain\n... what's causing this pain epidemic out there and what is going on\nIt's just a day that we live in right now we have more stress than ever before and that causes pain syndromes alternately but I can tell you that there is a real natural solution that can help you get to the root cause of that the ... I created Michael ... to take that cream\nApplied exactly to where it hurts ... and it goes in instantly because I wanted to give targeted relief okay ... ... if you're in pain relief now\nExactly well how fast as your formula work within Fifteen minutes really Fifteen minutes it's worked for me my family and hundreds of thousands of other people\nNow for someone that that may be interested in the in considering your glucose I mean ... what can really do for you\nOkay first of all in Fifteen minutes you're going to see reduced pain okay and it's going to help your body to lower inflammation\nAnd what the inflammation lower again air and rebuild your joints that's going to turn to restore flexibility and mobility you'll see daily you'll begin to regain your life you're going to play with your children and grandchildren and again you can get on the floor and get back up or\nYou can exercise you can lose weight Rosanna get around with more easing comfort and sleep very importantly if you can start to sleep again because I Know from personal experience that if you're in pain you can't sleep and that is very important when it comes to repairing regenerating and reclaiming your life\nAnd and people out there using your formula and and getting these benefits\nAbsolutely they are Chris I hear it every single day matter of fact I have a few emails and letters that I brought with me if you have a moment to hear about your sure um this is one from Henry From Ohio he says\nI've been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for many many years I'm Seventy seven years old I've been using ... and ... and other medications but never had favorable results I decided to order you ... your glucose named claim and had been very pleased with the results I Am now pain free\nFor which I think you also have an email quickly from Florence from Hollywood and wrote to miracle on back to working in my yard and riding my bike thanks to you\nSo those are just little things like that and but there are hundreds to back those up so\nThere was a natural way to do this and to the course of the show where then again there was a real help\nFolks who want to take a moment here to let your listeners know that if you want to try Dr Jim it's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred ... two one two four seven and eight seven\nDr Janet's formula is a fast acting glucose mean cream that provides relief on contact for those nagging aches and pains and\nDr Janice formula is a fast acting glucose and mean cream that provides relief on contact\nFor those nagging aches and pains in your joints neck back shoulders wrists hands and knees\nBasically anywhere it hurts and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr Janis ... cream and this is\nThis is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and is this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme it is and how minimal it is it's going to get your belief\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer and take your pain from my pen to a five and ... on the line with continue to use ... I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this is really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this was a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well doctors in it\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all of my things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't work\nFirst of all for ... or and I found for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the ... here taking into early to three months people give up\nPeople in pain they won't release and why now right and that I had developed this train again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try to have nothing to lose\n... okay again we're talking about Dr ... cream here in ... I mean somebody calls today gets your cream in tries it what should they expect ... realistically\nWithin the first Fifteen minutes asks you used to claim you'll notice the pain diminishes and just to

neighbors you want to go and take your kids to like you wanna walk your dog again him want to do all the time and just simple things you wash the car things other people take for granted right right I Will be able to do\nRight but on the other hand people want to know that um this is not just you're saying is they want to know that other people out there have been in their situations and and and I have gotten results\nWell I have letters and emails from people all over the country that's my heart good about a year to hear back\nI have an email from ... from New York she says I have arthritis in

appreciated when my when my wrists wasn't working very well\nI Will not be without this product ... just one more\nI've lost a pain in my knees and I can walk without any problems climb stairs sleep at night without pain I'm so glad I heard about the claim that makes me want to wake up in the morning and that's exactly what we would have vouchers thing makes me want to wake up in the war and see

I have if he testifies publicly based on what we just heard today uh I think the American people would would side with George Papadopoulos a regardless of party or when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nSo you basically and that is Mark Meadows the end you said you George Papadopoulos here in Studio he said I Want to go public it makes it was who you do better behind closed doors in retrospect was he right um I\nDon't know about doing better now but maybe the things I was talking about we're very sensitive and perhaps that's why it was better to do it behind the scenes you of\nThree countries coming at you Britain Australia and the U.S said in the United states FBI\nThat's right and to this day I don't understand why I had this particular ... target on me considering the we have the most sophisticated intelligence agencies in the world working here at at home and what the UK and Australia they of course knew I had no rush of contacts I mean you could just simply do background checks\nSo obviously I wasn't targeted for that I was targeted for some other reason and it's not my job to figure it out of jobs a view and the other reporters and probably Congress to figure out why Papadopoulos was the target\nAnd George of so lawmakers they read the transcript of your conversation with him Basset or down or said my biggest mystery is why with George ever take a plea and make guilt for lying to the FBI after reading this is what am I meant he asked me what am I missing I don't know what why did you take a plea\nI'm ... ...\nThere's a reason I have a new council now and I'm looking at all options to fight this and are really as I said on a TV earlier with you I just want to make sure that what happened to me never again happens to any American and if I'm going to fight this was not just for myself it's for any American citizen who might be targeted lawfully are lovely by our own government\nSo you're looking to possibly overturned that play ... absolutely that is a risk with that\nA risk but you know what it's a it's a it's a worthy risk because um my reputations on the line I think the integrity of his entire investigations on the line and sometimes you have to think of the greater good and not just yourself who's your\nThat's because um my reputations on the line I think the integrity of his entire investigations on the line and sometimes you have to think of the greater good and not just yourself who's your interaction with the Mueller probe like\nUm I I really can't get into too many details about my exact interactions with them but\n... as I said I'm looking to fight this right now so uh do the ... going to come out with a whole bunch of indictments evidently after the midterm elections if it's based on George Papadopoulos and they build from there what's your message to the Mueller probe um I have absolutely no idea who they are looking at or what they might be doing all I can do speak for myself and the\nUm if ... as I stated earlier I was targeted by western intelligence there was absolutely no reason I should have been prosecuted here is a Mark Meadows cut thirty for\nWhat's troubling for me is there a today a there is even a greater confirmation in my mind a that was inappropriate behavior on behalf\nOf the FBI and the OJ as they initiated this investigation as they continued with the investigation and as they continue to not give information to\nWhether it's Mr pap adopt listeners council or the American people are Congress\nBecause you have to put this together and you do not giving you information about you a ... look if it wasn't for the great work of a certain reporters\nI to this day I don't think anyone in this country let alone me or any council of mine would have known that there was this exculpatory evidence and use it very interesting that this myth seated at the helper a downer or the one thing in common they all do like President Trump and from ...\nAnd they have made progress there I think it's you know a long shot and now the Democrats would would win the Senate or the house um you know what you said is absolutely true although really you're taking it from somebody else you're just borrow that there was an original\nIdea [laughter] I like that but there is there is is palpable fear out there\nOn Democrats they keep having these flashbacks to election night twenty sixteen ... maybe they should but I'm just saying I'm it's somewhat irrational every election is different\nOr you're not going to have the same factors at work but they they were stunned really in shock for for weeks after the twenty sixteen election and they're worried that it's all going to happen again well maybe it will maybe it won't there's no sense worrying about it as one of those things in life you can't control\nTo the GDP and when I was at four point to last quarter and a half three point five to two very good numbers\nBut and now you have the tax cut and the original premise was hey are Republicans running the tax cuts and new one is look at this caravan and the immigration and this is what we're talking about and it's not a ... it's not a what is it is it's happening is that the Republicans running on the right thing\n[noise] well look this election is all about\nDonald Trump just like a Michael Steele was suggesting maybe not the way he was interpreting it but a Trump is placed himself at the center of this election he was going to be the center anyway Democrats would have made in the center of it if he had made in the center of it\nAnd most votes are going to be cast in reference to him that's not to say that issues don't play a big part they do for Republicans\nOr immigration has been at the top of the list for three years and that's why the care of and you know what I hear people say the Democrats funded the care of that I have to laugh it should be Republicans funded the care of that 'cause it's helping candidates it is putting immigration front\nAnd center right at the critical moment of the campaign the final days of a campaign\nSo Kavanaugh the caravan and Trump himself that\nIs that's what's driving the Republican side and to some degree the Democratic side\nWhich drew down on this is what Democrats have been saying some current trouble exist in the majority of non white districts were Democrats worry about turning out the Hispanic vote they have or just given up hope of an seating will hurt you know who goes against the president on the wall and the other things in these uh CIA guy remarkably competent and diverse\nBut and and and another a lotto over also in California so what's going on for your numbers tell you about the Hispanic vote in America\nWell there's great concern I Know on the Democratic side about getting a good turnout because they didn't get it and twenty six teams I mean it was Hispanics African Americans and millennials\nWho did not turn out it anywhere close to the rate they were expected to and of course that made the difference so they've detected relatively low\nInterest among Hispanics in the mid term election and and normally frankly uh minorities and millennials don't participate in the mid term so that's kind of a built in structural advantage for the Republicans [noise]\nAnd clearly a minorities and millennials don't participate in the mid term so that's kind of a built in structural advantage for the Republicans [noise] ah so you know you've always got access as you mentioned will heard what parties need to do and they have done to a certain degree is to allow\nThe district to dictate the nominee\nAnd in the case of will hurt that's a moderate district relatively speaking up close competitive modern district\nAnd will hurt has played that correctly he's he has used the issues that help him in avoided the issues that hurt him and that's why he's the favorite\nThere that makes sense and by the way we need people like this\nWho are going to have the lucrative security careers I've got a chance to norm little bit but they go back in the service where it's pay okay but you go to places on a regular basis you know you it's truly service and for Republicans to criticize will hurt them thinking to myself what do you want in a candidate\nThey all can't be speaking from the same him she then you're not serving the country don't you agree Dr ... well\nYeah and also you can actually get a majority if you insist on that you can't have everybody looking and sounding exactly alike this is a very diverse country and\nSo you have to adjust the nominee to the district and and really vice versa during gerrymandering but and you're right what people think that Congress\nMiller very well off and so and it's all of them are some of them are very wealthy before they come in but for relatively average people of modest means and they're quite a few of them in Congress it's a struggle to ruin a household in DC and another household at home because frankly Brian not everybody makes you kind of money\nRight or exactly you know except not even close not even close brought him you know how did he gets goes no handling yeah well\nWe're not he's probably doing just a little bit better so he owes you\nRight now yes and put it this way my helicopter is not a new when he gets a new helicopters leases them a mine I I bought an old during an eye refurbish\nAt all like for me I insist on a new job every year to contract\nAll right so having said that when we leave transportation for just a second and again I blame you for getting us off track and ... that I'm a hundred percent correct he has to either\nPromised means go cut that part of who will never have a record of who is Peter I got to meet him he's yeah he's he's one of your of hundreds of assistance exact back they're running some machine\nTom for as friends the DNC tell me if he's playing a game or is he really worried\nWe will look at their ... and it was going to be close I don't use the term ... I always talk about the name for the blocking and tackling\nI Know a lot of people talk about this blue wave and all that so I don't believe in I happen to think that on a lecture night they're going to find a very very close situation and maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats hugging control of the house\nAnd so are they just playing down expectations Bernie Sanders Tom braid upper as well we're just a pushing aside the blue wave trying to motivate people\nIn a while it's both really I mean basically they're saying ah I'm having flashbacks twenty sixteen I'm afraid the other half of it is a they have to insist that the election is very very close to get their people out because many Democrats aren't used to participating in midterms\nSo it's it's a bit of both uh in the middle of the night there having the twenty sixteen flashbacks during the day they're trying to motivate the Democratic party constituencies\nIt's hard to comment on breaking news but we found another package on this one to James Clapper in New York City when I started the show walking upstairs they found they looked like another package was heading to Cory Booker\nI Do hear that they're close to an arrest but so far that hasn't stopped the packages that were seemed to have been put in a put in place some point this week when you look at this and we hope no one's heard and he seemed to be a bomb making material but no there's no ... there and know blasting cap thankfully\nOr having said that who does this play more for the the Democrats who say that the president's language is causing this or the Republicans are who are security a party\nI wanted to see who it is and maybe it's a person maybe as persons you gave me some good news I hadn't realized they were close to an arrest I'm thrilled to hear that because this is intolerable and God\nKnows I Hope that one hundred percent or maybe Ninety nine percent knowing knowing our country as we do [noise] Ninety nine\nPercent would agree this is absolutely unacceptable this goes way beyond the bounds of of anybody's definition of a discourse in politics so let's find out who did it let's find out what\nThe motives were then we can assess the damage if there is any maybe there won't be any effect at all politically but we have to know who it is and what the motives were\nHow could a president\nDamage if there is any maybe there won't be any effect at all politically but we have to know who it is and what the motives were\nSo how can a president and I asked this question yesterday without creating a great answer so all the pressures on you\nI'm president who's had three uh three hit books on it from ... to Michael Wolff to Bob Woodward he had an anonymous staffer write an editorial talking about how incompetent tea is he's had multiple people like Tillerson and reportedly Kelly basically Komen idiot\nBut yet he is now at forty seven percent of the wall Street Journal NBC and forty four percent according to CNN approval that's just about just above President Obama how did and now he's ... and now he's trying to nationalize this election and making about himself\nI Know we have to rewrite and rethink everything in the Donald Trump era but can you make sense of that\nSure he made that connection with his people the people the forty six percent who voted for him that has endured the course you also have to say he made a connection with the people who didn't vote for and then there's also endured people made up their minds about Donald Trump a long time ago\nThis additional information you just mentioned yet much of it\nIt makes no difference or if you're for a mere really for him if you're against him you're really against him I've yet to meet anybody in the middle\n... have you polled them I mean independents are undecided using motivator to say\nNo but they're they've already made up their minds about Donald Trump they may not have made up their minds about who they're going to vote for in this midterm election because after all while Donald Trump is is center stage there are other people on the stage I mean the candidates matter their issues matter the ah the states in districts that are so\nAh you once again you're over generalizing rye and and I guess this is leading back to another discussion in another plug for your book\nNo I think that you are becoming more belligerent than Chris Wallace on the show and I didn't think that was possible this is really a blizzard as good as", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "28"}
