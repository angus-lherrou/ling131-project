crew only about on certain prettier but gray bumps called across the British make additions people housing letter like it's not that you think\nWe're a forecast track as a showing it making landfall right now that could change a little bit of course pie\nI let's talk intensity now over the years the actual forecast path\nHas gotten better intensity is still one of those areas where we're still trying to get better I\nSo now where where where in a category one the five o'clock eastern advisory for central had the maximum sustained winds at eighty miles an hour or so up five from the intermediate forecasted at two PM\nAnd you guys are projecting it to intensify with two and then potentially a three what makes landfall on the Florida coastline is that correct\nThat's correct were explicitly forecasting a store to be come a major hurricane and about thirty six hours on a still a lot of with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico\nA then as it makes a term or to North northeast and biggest opposed to for pan handle might see a little bit of slight weakening but still be near major hurricane strength and the reason why we have the sub category of\nMajor hurricane intensities because statistically about eighty five percent of major hurricanes\nAccount for most of the damage that we see with land falling storms\nAre you on a confidence level do you think we're going to see this as a hip the panhandle or ill around or near Panama City too I now as far as the tracking are you looking at more of an east worldly bias or is it still up in the air whether it does go to the west of Panama City\nWhere are you asking the question is Todd we have a reconnaissance aircraft are from no headed in there right now and give us a more information on where the exact center is but looking at satellite imagery right now it looks like the storm is not deviated or anywhere to the left like the models have been indicating is still moving north or maybe even a little eastern north so we might have to see some\nEastward adjustments a and the track a you know maybe closer to Appalachian coal but again the the storms will be relatively large so anywhere from certainly Panama City east where the Tallahassee area is probably going to see the worst conditions associated with Michael\nAnd once it does strike the Florida coast and again listen I I don't wish you know being a Floridian ah since Nineteen Ninety two when\nI arrived just after Andrew and saw the aftermath of that yeah I Do wish this on anybody but you know as far as the big ... big band Appalachian coal is certainly it's it's much less populated that if you put further west you know towards the Fort Walton Beach Panama City or Niceville et cetera deaths than\nThat that's correct Todd uh right now you know all indications are would likely be making landfall perhaps Panama City little Easter there and some of the lesser populated areas excluding you know the Tallahassee area that has a a fairly significant populations that are being the state capital\nNow moisture wise you know once it does strike Florida and it moves pretty quickly according to the forecast pass into Georgia South Carolina North Carolina I Virginia exiting somewhere maybe along the Carolina Virginia border back out into the Atlantic\nI I mean we're talking about adding insult to injury or after obviously what could be significant damage from a category two and a category three but then the rainfall amounts over already saturated areas could be intense as well right\nThat is correct uh unfortunately uh Michael we'll be taking a path to the northeast moving across the Carolinas the areas that were devastated by flooding from Hurricane Florence\nOh about a month or so ago I'm sort of a maybe a good new situation as it is going to be moving quickly uh and that will lessen the amount of rainfall that they'll get so they're not going to be getting you know any of the you know two feet three feet\nRainfall totals there'll be saying but you know even six to eight inches of rain\nUh would obviously create a some problems for them there but another thing they have to consider is all that water than standing for a long time to root systems are now going to be just saturated not very stable so it's a storm moves through it won't take much wind to start popping up a lot of trees are in the Carolinas especially uh eastern North Carolina where they had all the flooding\nAnd we saw that horrific story I'm sure you remember the mother an infant that were killed when a tree fell and hit their house in North Carolina\nYes a very bad and so we don't want people to look at this and say oh well the storm is going to be we can to fifty miles per hour winds all those fifty miles per hour winds uh will be up there on the tops of those top pines\nAnd we measured the wind at the surface a self uh pine tree is sixty eighty feet tall winds up there can easily be ten miles per hour faster and with the roots are already saturated the ground very soft a trees typically will go down and much less winds of what you normally would require\nAnd as I've always learned or if you're a high rise building if you're twenty thirty stories up or you could see a category jump or an increased because of the altitudes\nThat is correct so when we forecast a Michael to be\nMajor hurricane strength near a category three intensive you want to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle if people were in high rise apartments up around you know two hundred feet or so they could easily see a winds up there at that altitude you know when you're a category four string\nAre amazing and then let's talk timeline where ah last I saw were looking at an event impacting the or the Florida Panhandle host of Wednesday afternoon to Wednesday evening is that timeline still current\nWill officially a we're showing landfall Wednesday afternoon a roughly about a year between two and five o'clock but we don't want people to focus on that specific time because the storm is a quite large wind significant wins a least tropical storm force will be going to affect\nThe coastal areas there with the Florida Panhandle they were from Appalachia cooler up to near Panama City or easily by early Wednesday morning before the sun comes up\nAll right Stacy Stuart thank you so much for the times senior hurricane specialist National Hurricane center or in the Miami area Stacey thanks for joining us Amish that show ... thank you\nBye bye bye again those that are listening in the panhandle please I mean you don't have a lot of time here in this timeline is compressed because the storm is already\nIn the Gulf of Mexico so please a category three is the forecast when it hits near Panama City\nSo my thoughts are with everyone listening in the panhandle\nAnd then up toward Tallahassee and then into southern Georgia obviously across the middle of the state and then into South Carolina\nAnd then North Carolina into it looks like it'll rain wise once this thing gets moving we're looking at the you know upstate the south Carolina Greenville Spartanburg area looks like I mean it was a projected winds and rain and and then uh you know across a yo Raleigh Durham as well across the triangle area\nA eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero

terrorism expert ensure a bank for America the largest national security grassroots organization in the country and the New York times best selling author of a new book called rise regimes it's good to have you back on the program thanks for taking up on\nOur own delighted to be back with you I Want\nTo know what you think of of what happened last week an over the last couple of weeks but ending with the vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh as the latest member of the Supreme Court on Saturday\nWell America as we know it is being transformed before our very eyes and what we saw in the last two weeks I was basically a wakeup call for conservatives will love this country because that left has declared the war on the United states on every\nFlag waving national anthem saluting veteran respecting police honoring founding father cherishing patriotic American the conservative side did not realize that we are at war until the last two weeks and I believe large that this upcoming election America's future is on the ballot\nPeople are going to vote for in America where you are guilty until proven innocent or in America where you are innocent until proven guilty\nBruce reducing the Republicans have\nThe guts to make that argument because you want to make the argument easily that this really is about what they're not the presumption is there and if not what does it mean\nBut I think I get the feeling that while the left seemingly will do almost anything to win\nThat there are a lot of conservatives who are afraid to say something now we've had plug some surprises from people like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham who was a riot are but does it runs for the Republicans have the ... have the you know the the backbone\nTo say this is what we're up against and do you want that kind of America were the kind we offer\nWell this question has\nA two layer to answer on the political side of the elected officials I think after watching Lindsey Graham become a rock star overnight I think what what team did last week made him to start at the ... to ... define him through his political career and I think that I really I think you know what if\nYou develop a backbone if you speak passionately it will resonate with the people because what Lindsey Graham\nDead is he echoed the voice of president Donald Trump for the last two years and the way he spoke the courage he displayed the moral clarity you spoke the authority you spoke with and that touched a nerve\nAnd the American public so I Hope that I left that officials who are running this election thinking wow if I Want my spot them delight my day in the sunshine I Need to start speaking more boldly Allah Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham on the grass roots side\nYou know a lot of conservatives are not emotional people that are logical people so we are not that people are going to show up on the side of the road that straight I break glass breaking buildings that create a riot block highways\nIt's not in our nature this is not what we do but it was up to this point thought well if I just go out and\nVote you know that that will be it I'm going to make my voice known but what what we saw in the last week showed conservative that activism goes far beyond just voting every two years there are a lot of things you can do between the two years and I hope that that\nI chose conservatives how much the left as organized and they need to be involved in grassroots movements that are fighting on behalf of our country I'll give you a perfect example with my organization ad for America we saw a spike because of the cabinet when people came\nBecause they wanted to know what they can do as a citizen and that's what I lay out in my book I wrote my book rise in defense of American values and\nBecause I wanted to give people ideas and tips as to what\nThey can do to make a difference for example at the end of every chapter I have a section titled rise up and asked why do people three things you can do under ten minutes and you can do them while sipping your cup of coffee in the morning when you're sitting in front of your computer\nThat's a great way to do it now will there also be some suggestions in there for elected officials because Bridgette\nI Would love to see citizens turn up at public meetings and I would apply this to Republicans as well as Democrats and Republicans especially\nThere are so many Republicans who won't say something even though it seems very apparent that they want to lead you to believe they are in favor of something but they don't want to say it out loud they don't want to say the words where you just said saying if you believe in the presumption of innocence you have\nTo support what we just did and if you don't\nThen you ought to be prepared to explain to your fellow citizens while you're willing to throw somebody under the bus and what are you going to say when they come and do it to your friends or your family members I Need I Need a citizens to go to to elected officials and demand that they speak the truth plainly\nExactly and I and and he said perfect words because right now they did it together now next they're\nComing to you know they're coming up to your some of that coming after your family and and that was on display in Washington DC the last two weeks it's not going to end with Kevin now I Know it's interesting you mentioned the town hall meetings and the last chapter of my book wise I had a whole chapter is dedicated\nTo how citizens but it's people like you and me who need to get their wife out how to fill up the town hall meetings and how to ask questions to your elected officials I even lay out a plan how to make friends\nHell to sit across the audience how to have a pre within questions how to stand up and ask these questions how to set up your elected\nOfficial to understand that you represent the majority in your community you know the last word books on\nHow to mobilize the grassroots or whether it's was organizing for action by president\nObama weather now indivisible the resist\nLook I signed up to get all these leftist organization I'm emails by the way right now in law says you and I are speaking there are eighty five that's just a grassroots movements operating in the country and mobilizing on the right side people are asleep so what I Hope to do and that book rise\nAnd I encourage single person who is listening to end this interview right now to go out and get the book because it's a road map not only to how you can call their elected officials on hold their feet to the fire\nBut also how the global lies in your community to show up the city council meetings to show up to I I liked it official town hall meetings\nTo elected official on the spot and record their answers how to use your cell phones as a tool to spread messages on your social media we on the right to understand that and the tools that make us\nPowerful grassroots citizens participating in the future about what country and the decisions that are made on behalf that will affect\nUs and our children for generations to come\nAnd Bridgette I um I get frustrated when people I agree with politically will show up at a meeting they'll get the opportunity ask your question and then they either want to stand up and give a speech before they asked the question not ... and good sometimes the symbolism question you can ask\nYou will you support new gun controls will you do something about building a wall and and then just to amplify by saying and I want a simple answer\nThat we all understand a yes or no not something that allows you to skate out either side make the question less than two sentences long preferably one less than one sons law long because otherwise politicians are used to the non answer for the question they don't want to answer\nExactly perfect I Love the way you phrase it because that's exactly what they need to do you need to ask you a question and stop speaking to let it go dead silent enforce\nThe elected official and giving you that the what they stand on the show because it costs like that that is a very pointed and very clear they cannot beat around the Bush would there is there they've got the right question and\nMake sure that your friends who are you at that town hall meeting that you drive to the meeting are standing there with a cell phone wanting so they elected\nOfficial looking at the audience want to know that answer or\nBut we can we can at continuous cycle of this um you know it it it it you know and the Spanish went to a certain parts of North America and the French went to a certain parts of the best and the English and the Dutch went to a certain parts of the ... and then he had\nFor various and sundry wars and\nSome people stopped coming

[noise] welcome back\nTo Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be we view on this Monday following one of the most bruising political fights that we have ever seen in American history\nSo now I think it's going to be a great time to talk to Greg Miller who is the Pulitzer Prize winning national security correspondent for the Washington Post and the author most recently of the princes Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy Mr Miller thanks very much for taking the time tonight\n... absolutely thank you\nSo at this point I Know the mother investigation is still going on but should Americans believe that there really is some they're they're in this or or is this just a political tool that's been used by one party or another to try to gain political advantage or [noise]\nUm if you are asking whether there's any they're there to the mall or investigation yeah we've seen we've seen indictment after indictment and I think an exquisite detail and many of these indictments to show that they Russia interference was absolutely real despite what President Trump has has tried to say uh and\nI think we are um you know police to learn a great deal more about what Mueller has regarding Trump's and his financial organizations connections to Russia in the coming months\nBut are we going to find I always thought the essential question was whether or not foreign governments tried to mess with their elections I think most of us know that happens and I think they know that America messes in other countries elections just as the Obama administration actually spent public money trying\nTo change the outcome of the election in Israel but the central question was use\nI think it depends on how\nYou view this in which side are ultimately I think though that this is all still viewed very partisan lens in many ways right so do we know of a\nDefinitive smoking gun memo that letter poop and Donald Trump both signed the green to cooperate to get Donald Trump in the office in exchange for explicit favors\nNo but there was lots and lots of open a signaling between Trump\nAnd food and and Russia throughout the campaign there were efforts to hide from the American people negotiations that the Trump Administration was making before it took office I'm thinking of Michael Flynn telling a Russian sit tight will take care of these sanctions for you are\nAnd of course there is unclear evidence that the Trump and uh um inner circle was really receptive to assistance from Russia it's not directly seeking at Trump Tower meeting has pretty compelling evidence for that\nBut the general Flynn conversation is that not the kind of conversation you might have expected from an incoming person in his position to some foreign governments where you say ... don't don't react yet we've got a new administration coming in that you would have seen that whether there was\nCooperation between the Trump team and the Russians for the election you might have seen that just because well for the same reason that a President Obama said on an on a hot Mike or intel sell ... I'll have more flexibility after the election\nWell he did have more flexibility Disney\nIt's interesting but if it were just sort of run of the mill ordinary signaling between a pending administration and a foreign government you know why would why did Flynn and go to such lengths to lie about it he lied to the president they lied to Sean Spicer lied to the FBI have you figure that\nOne out of board that is one of the puzzles of this if it's all above board why is there such effort across the Trump Administration to service suppressed these fact tonight effects that similarly to Trump's initial explanation of the Trump Tower meeting obviously has undergone so many revisions if there is nothing to hide why are they doing so much hiding\nBut I I I I've been ... ... Lee confused on this and obviously Greg as the author of The Apprentice and as a man who covers national\nSecurity you're much more ... than in this than I Am I still don't understand why one Flint agreed to talk to the FBI and then when it became clear that they were asking about conversations he's had that you would think would be\nIntercepted I mean as as an essay wouldn't he have known that everything he said on the phone line to the Russian ambassadors people or to the Russian ambassador himself was going to be on a transcript somewhere and the FBI was trying to say we want to see if you will tell us what we already know and what we already have\nSo it makes you wonder whether the FBI had deliberately set out to say we know every word he says let's see if we can get them to tell a different version then we've got 'em in a process crime\nThere's a lot of detail in the book that has not surfaced publicly because I've ... I was involved in breaking the they playing story for the Washington Post and got over\nThat sweet sequence of events and detail with dozens of additional interviews for the book it's not only that Mike Flynn should have known and having been director of the defense intelligence agency what\nA sort of surveillance exists of of foreign adversaries here in the United states but in fact there were people inside the Trump transition who are so alarmed about the Trump inner circle sort of teams interactions with Russia signals about Russia that they tried to stage an intervention was planned\nAfter a meeting in which he talked about needing to have a conversation with the Russian ambassador\nThere were people who are trying to get the CIA profile of the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in Mike Flynn's hands and telling him you got to be careful what you're doing here and he ignored all of it listen graves level of determination terms of their actions here that's just astonishing\nI'm Talking to Greg Miller who's the author most recently The Apprentice let me ask you a question that has ... me and I I Do see it through a partisan lens but I I'm willing to say that of Republicans have broken the law if we're\n... we're Republicans have done things that are not good for America than than they should be you know they should be appropriately punished for it but here's the Russia collusion that I don't understand why it has become more of the public discussion and I have\nTo think it's because of the mainstream media we know that the Russian officials who told Christopher Steele a whole big pack of stories most of which turns out seemed to be untrue unpredictable and almost ridiculous or in the Steele dossier he\nHe is he puts together a document with information from Russian government officials for Hillary Clinton and the DNC had their body has and paid for by them which is then used\nIn what could only be a an attempt to change the outcome of the election one other purpose would there be of trying to push this documented so many news people and it's so many officials if not to change the outcome of the election when that didn't happen they used it to try to take apart the Trump presidency once the election was over\nWhy isn't that seen as a collusion between the other side with Russian government officials through paid intermediaries to create a different outcome for the ...\n... well I think if you look at the you know what to steal was hired\nTo do and how he was hired and how\nHe does not told who the client was and how initially fusion GPS has hired in fact by Republican or a neutral operatives to look at Trump and to sort of look into his background\nAnd then they turn and get funding from the Democrats only after after Trump is one of the primary and they think that they're on to such fascinating material they think somebody ought to be willing to pay for it and of course they do find that the DNC is willing to pay for it um\nBut still you know is a by all accounts a pretty straight up a former British Intelligence official a nobody accuses him I don't think of things sort of a political hit man here\nAnd it's we don't know a whole lot yet about the sources of his material for the steel ... but I guess I Would argue that you know although some of it is I'm proven it certainly seems plausible that Trump would be interacting it would be conducting themselves in in a\nMoscow and all the way he conducted himself in Lake Tahoe with Stormy Daniels I'm not sure why that would be so astonishing if that were to be true\nIf it were true do you think ... is largely true are largely not\nI don't really have a firm opinion on it I think that the abroad as strokes it's it's actually held up pretty well I think you're right though that\nBecause of the large number of people who are just qualified somebody so that's something that hasn't really occurred to a lot of people as well and some of the losses that

easier way to relative to other district to be able to pass some of the policies or elected congressional numbers\nDeserve practically mean but the representation of some people in this country is being diluted by the president to lose your wheels\nPulled out the entire debate our system is based on one person one vote and to the commentary as being ... and then the lawsuits are\nAre now being created it's a matter of challenging this this question of really is it one person one vote when some districts have an easier way\nOf passing things or electing representative because there are so many disqualified voters in their districts\nLet me ask you a straight ahead a constitutional questions singer constitutional attorney\nUm are people who are here in the country illegally are they in title to representation in Congress will tell you were in the state legislature of even though they're here in the country illegally as is has there been a definitive answer to them\nYou know uh and people will say yes there has\nNot what they're doing is looking at a law suit that went to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court looked at the issue of district day so that's a matter of how the lines are drawn and they said that these people count as far as\nThe drawing of the lines but the question has never been answered when it comes to apportion that and that means how we figure out\nOr the four hundred and thirty five congressional districts and that's a fixed number so it's very much as there are some games\nAnd so when it comes to those districts and how many people count in the district and whether they are citizens and eligible to vote that question has never been answered and it does all go back to kind of an arcane issue because the fact that\nWhen our country was founded it was a matter of the state's looking at people who are eligible to vote in just different states we all have different policies back then as to what was\nWhat a ... created eligibility and and the wording habits and which carries with it a legal status\nWas used to qualify that people who were here and eligible to vote so now it's a matter of looking back at that language and the original intense and and understanding\nThat person and have it and when it came to the way that our founding fathers originally looked at this um inhabitant meant somebody who was here lawfully and who was qualified to but\nDoes it help moves will do that we now have another originalist thank God on the U.S Supreme Court if this thing come to record\nIt very well may help when it comes to exactly the kind of an issue which is\nWhat with we are interpreting our constitution and the way that it was meant to be interpreted in the spirit of the time and what the founders intended enough yet\nThen we are looking for people that\nWould be faithful to that original into\nWell I'm looking forward to that would have standing to bring ... I've only got about twenty seconds but how could somebody go ahead\nAlabama fares losing a state\nAnd so there is a harm that demonstrable so states like Alabama where they're looking at the shift that has been happening and certainly as California ... stop for other states do those seats come from somewhere else so it's\nThe states that begin to look at what their accounts are in some already have on those states would have the standing to either joined Alabama I Would think or create their own cause of action their own lawsuit\nLou go to a pleasure to charge all look forward to the next

and he actually has\nA\nDog fight welcome\nBack to the Martin Lawrence when Joe pleasure to be with you and I'm Glad to\nTake your phone calls and your emails you know good for a lot of it as we look at China\nAnd we see China as a country that wants to be a militarily preeminent on planet earth and they want to be economically preeminent uh I think that they would they would like to replace the United states as the biggest single economic player on the globe and the biggest some single military player on the globe and I\nI don't think they're taking any prisoners when they started creating artificial islands and they started to uh to push a bit against us and say don't come near us or that sort of thing so I thought we'd talk about that was Stephen ... who's the author of bully of Asia why China's dream is the new threat to the world order\nSteven it sounds like you and I are both on the same side on here on this issue but how big is the threat that our country faces from a China\nWell the threat from China and plenty Eighteen is like the threat from the Soviet Union in Nineteen sixty or Nineteen Seventy at the height of the Cold War\nWhen we were afraid that the Soviet Union had more troops more missiles and a faster growing economy than we did\nI it turned out that they did have more troops to more missiles but the economy was uh was largely exaggerated and when President Reagan took power was elected president or a man that I think the greatest president of the twentieth century um eight he turned up the heat on the Soviet Union and it gradually\nCollapse a and I think we have a president now is turning up the heat on China and\nChina is facing the same kind of a system in collapse if we can keep the pressure on if we can came the Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi is from a grabbing the levers of power and the Trump beach from I think we'll win this thing\nI like to remind people ski but then you back me up or or correct me if I'm wrong that while we have a large national debt the national debt in terms of gross domestic product that China has\nMakes ours look small by comparison and China at some point he was going to have to come to grips with the fact that they owe an awful lot of money that they have a a a huge amount of debt and and they're very dependent on the rest of the world because that's where the goods made in China are sold for the most part not to their own domestic population\nYeah you couldn't be more correct because the only sector of the Chinese economy that\nActually runs a profit is the export sector\nAnd the export sector runs a profit because they have\nLargely until recently\nI have had unfettered access to the largest consumer market in the world which is the United states the rest of the socialist planned economy of China is is a nightmare of wasted money wasted resources um bridges to nowhere roads that no one uses and and so forth buildings stand empty\nSo if we can cut off their easy access\nTo the American consumer market or their economy may limp along for a while but you're right they've got debt or we don't know exactly how much they have actually it's at least three hundred percent three times the annual\nGross domestic product show they spent every any that they made for the next three years they might be able to pay off the debt they might not so they've got a huge huge debt to carry around and and that's one of their weaknesses\nWhereas in the United states by comparison we have a a a gross domestic product drove around twenty trillion dollars and the national\nDebt around twenty trillion ours is a hundred percent of GDP your gp theirs is three times the size proportionate\nYou know and our economy is now I think growing faster than China is now you wouldn't you wouldn't think that looking at the official figures but all of the official figures in China are nonsense every year\nI see gene thing the new red emperor comes out with a plan saying we're going to get six point one present economic growth this year and every\nProvince in every city in China records six point one percent except a few very ambitious party officials report six point two or six point three or six forty four percent but the real growth is probably down at two or three percent we're growing out over four percent so the gap between the U.S and China is not\nIt's actually widening because we've turned on the great engine of American Capitalism and his running now at full speed\nI'm Talking to Stephen ... who's the author of bully of Asia why trying his dream is the threat\nNew threat to the world order at some point though when the numbers they give out publicly and and it kind of reminds me is I think it did you of the old Soviet Union where they would announce that we're going to harvest fifty million bushels of weight or whatever the number was\nAnd they would only harvest forty and for domestic consumption they just go back and change the numbers and say well we were planning to harvest thirty eight and we came in and forty you can run those kind of games on your domestic population as long as you control information that comes into them but does it still possible to do that\nAnd have people actually believe what the government is telling them in an Internet age\nWell you know the the Chinese have built all over the centuries are they now have built a great fire wall and in an effort to keep information and news from the outside world from percolating in China and I think it's it's it's partly successful things get posted on the Internet\nA critical of the government they get taken down literally large within seconds within seconds or and so you know they they've got banks and banks of of computer terminals\nAnd and many in sitting in front of them making sure that that know criticism of the party of the military of the government and above all of of the new red emperor see gene thing gets posted on the Internet now we try to do an end run around that back\nIn the early nineties I was on the presidential commission that set up Radio Free Asia which is our radio broadcast service that broadcast news and information about what's really happening in China\nBack into China to do an end run around the state controlled media and I think that's been fairly fairly successful over the years uh\nYeah the information information to lease and they don't have a an absolute monopoly on news the way they did and the Soviet Union back\nIn the thirties when oh my goodness style and killed\nFour million people in Ukraine and ended up having\nA a ... a manipulated a deliberate famine to kill off the rich peasants and no one on the outside world knew about it the Wilder around the the New York times are saying that everyone is well fed and the Soviet Union there's no starvation millions of people were starving to death at that time\nSo how how long can they maintain this this pretends that they have all this success when all of the people generating the fake numbers are are in on the secret and it's no longer a secret in other words if you're saying everybody should report six percent growth\nAnd ... you must have multiple people in each of those provinces saying make the numbers look the way the president wants them to walk but everybody involved in creating those numbers knows they're fake\nYeah well they do it and and are they the the premier or not the current one but the previous one\nAdmitted this a Premier Wen Jiabao ten years ago he said I really don't pay any attention to the numbers because they were all fabricated he said I really look at the uh the number of containers are being shipped from Shanghai to the United states I really look at uh the electrical power that we're using I really look at the rail traffic\nHe said that gives me a sense of how the economy is really doing the numbers he said don't matter but that was a rare moment of ender on the part of Chinese officials\nAll right Steve in in the last minute what's the best way for the United states to react to this to counter it if necessary and to take on the bully of Asia\nWell to do exactly what President\nTrump is doing he's a he's a dealmaker he's going from from issue to issue getting the best deal he can and and getting as many\nConcessions as again and then moving out of the next ... the Chinese the Trump the strategic they're terrified of him\nIs pressuring China economically but also militarily an ideologically as well and and I think his goal and it should be to to prevent China for replacing the United states is the dominant power in the world or the world under the U.S has a safer or more democratic place than it would be under China I think everybody would agree with that\nSteven it's always a pleasure thanks for monitoring the congratulations on the success of bully of Asia why China's dream as the new threat to the world order we appreciate your time denied\nAre increasing and don't have a quite a steady slow about a week to ten days before so people do watch a little more they just make up their mind and they noticed that they're right there and they they go in and vote early uh\nEnd but some of the things they are discovering are quite amusing which one is that millennials are are dropping off dramatically\nThey don't participate so much in early voting because they're too many steps you have to often applied to get an application to get the ballot you have to fill it out you have to sometimes you know things like their Social Security number or have your put down your your proper dress and then you have to find a stamp\nAn envelope at a mailbox and these are steps that you know millennials just really can't do no do you believe that\nDuring what the result has been with millennials in states like especially Oregon I mean I happen to my broadcast studios there but one of the disturbing things I've seen is that they have automatic registration too often I I hear from parents who say my sixteen year old daughter is registered to vote and\nI said yeah she can't vote till she's Eighteen but they do it automatically when you get a driver's license when you make it that\nEasy where the minute you get government id or whether it's a driver's license or an ID card you're registered you get a ballot then once you turn Eighteen it comes in the mail whether you ask for it or not and all you have to do is pick it up open it up market put it back in the envelope and send it back\nWhen they make that easy do millennials still drop off or do they vote in greater numbers\nI bought I I'm not sure they have the data yet on things like that we really are in the beginning stages of a new experiment and uh but I\nThink a lot of your life is but I was a county chair at one point and I and very well versed on how you register voters and how you get people on the ballot and things like that but uh I think when you drop a ... a\nID and I'm a registered in a in a location where you are permanent resident you get voter fraud yeah I mean you're going to have ballot\nAs a male to people who don't live there who at one point lived there so there is no way to verify who that person is trying\nTo break where you have voter id you go in on election day and they see your driver's license and they eat or a and they match it up on a some kind of voter roll and that\nDoes a a provide a security level to ensure that the people who say they are ... who they are voting or actually Bodie and uh I I Do think as the eye\nAfter this election and we're still trying to figure out some of the cyber security issues to secure our voting system I Do think we are going to go again back\nAt this issue of us who is voting and a ...\nI saw the just today the LA Times broke a story saying that the DMV in a department of motor vehicles in California has admitted there were twenty three thousand registration mistakes\nIncluding a Canadian citizen who got notified he's lived in California but he was notified he was newly registered to vote\nHe does have a California driver's license but he's not a citizen of the United states citizen to Canada according to the LA Times and he said I Know I'm not going to vote I'm not allowed to vote but that won't necessarily apply to everyone if you've been living in California for Thirty years in Europe for national and somebody sends you a notice saves says you can vote I imagine\nSome people will simply take the opportunity even though doing it is committing a crime they apparently had tens of thousands of these kinds of mistakes just in the state of California where they do have automatic registration and where they are giving drivers' licenses to both legal and illegal aliens\nAnd eight so I could give you another example am in twenty Thirteen when there are like Bloomberg was a complete his third term he\nHad two hundred people in the department investigations go out in the eye twenty Thirteen Years race and vote as dead people and sixty one out of the two hundred could vote as a dead person ... you know when to stop the other and\nAh and so if you know that is what happens is a New York is not a voter id state so people can walk in and they are to Terry they're sticking your church with why does on a what does\nThe list and so without voter id dead people he knows he he uh you know people will argue whether there is a voter fraud and he uh he he has a way to prove that you know that there that that people could both\n... and Adele it is a pleasure to have you on the program I really appreciate you taking the time stay on the story of a feeling that this election is going to produce some interesting results and it may not be all that comforting to those of us who consider voting a

that he's put into effect did you see his executive orders and what comes out of the White House about separation of powers and what they believe you know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief that\nThe Democrats\nTruly are and it really hit when you realized it was the main stream it was those in the Senate Judiciary committee in is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset of authoritarianism and\nFascism that mindset that they were throwing at Trump actually belongs\nTo their party and they only get shredded officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared some Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the uh of supporting the Republican

right now the the forecast of course as they always do kind of change going back and forth and so we'll follow it as\nIn fact the John Will uh in our forecast and for ... here's your national forecasts we\nBegin the week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge rainfall wind impacts\nBeen completely bulldozed by the left and not the protestors are not the media but members of that committee or the the leaders of the party [noise] and that\nShould be motivating to every Republican I I Believe it is\nBut I think uh and and hearing or the Lindsey Graham talk about the the campaigning he'll do and some of those purple states are over the next few weeks to remind people that kind of campaigning has\nTo be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on his program needs to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing\nAnd reminding the public want the left is doing a ... you don't have to ... you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing you demonstrated\nAs one caller said you know just play just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years of that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that\nOver and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it has to this country or for about the last so I'm\nGoing to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend the\nConservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun a negative ad campaign with\nHaving to be crude or rude yourself all you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself you don't have to add\nOn to any thing from what we've seen\nThe last two weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any untruth right all you have to do is pointing out the truth of where now\nAnd this is very very important\n... where the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply and for weeks I don't know\nBut the one thing that I've gotten from independence is they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God what in the world are these people about there is no sense of\nOf fairness there is no sense of stability for they don't ... they don't care about it you know are\nTaking ... taking somebody and destroying their life\nAnd and I mean I've heard this from independence on both sides are they destroyed board life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to do to destroy a\nKavanaugh's life said on both sides you said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's lived we destroyed we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we\nBut on both sides said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's live we destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity\nWe just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play fair and I do think\nThat there is something here that is even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat which means you're going to get a lot of independents that that move in the Republican you know direction it's going to be nothing because of okay will what will Gorsuch and cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive in I think it was going to drive it is the very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say these aren't fair people these aren't reasonable people\nRight now and I think if you look at it I got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America or\nThe left may think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them and that they're they're jumping on and in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims the fact of the matter is that's not the case with middle America they see the behavior\nOf the protest it's not to dismiss a claim it is in fact to do exactly\nWhat was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered eighty\nSeven background check and that rationally game doctor for her time on TV in front of the American people to make her\nCase you know something you just part of a great point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the\nProtesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in ... in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians that they're saying the exact same things as\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee or using the same argument\nYes they are they're basically ... the arguments and and claims made by these protesters\nAnd their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing what was the tactic being considered the first day the weekend before the first day of during a confirmation hearings\nOn Kavanaugh it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents thing by the way we're that go nowhere because they had nothing is Democrats always do these days\nIt wasn't about challenging him on his position on\nOn a rosy weight or anything else it wasn't I mean it was for Republicans with Sotomayor or taken you know what do you think if the government you can the government force you to buy vegetables\nAnd you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to\nObamacare but the the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left in the mainstream members of the party [noise]\nThe ones who are elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to

C. F. having a problem they don't have\nEnough ... and they don't have enough counselors or people to work with at risk kids and then you have a situation like this where to me if I were king of Iowa was governor there is a kind of thing where this sort of situation should be among the first thing absolute you make sure there's there's money for you should you should\nBe around when I get some of these calls do yeah and it's just ah I I I get them\nGet them all but I took a call on the show here once about maybe two years ago from a young man in Waterbury he said I Would be\nConsidered what you would call an at risk kid he goes I'm a little older now I'm OK he goes but he said I Wish I could see or talk to my D. C. S. caseworker more because he's really helped me but her caseload is so heavy\nI Can't talk to her or I Can't see her as much as I Want to she's kept me out of trouble the kid told me right here he was from Waterbury on this show so you have stuff like that and you have stuff like here where\nYou know ... we have families and kids lacking health care to me this should be priority number one\nYou know quite yeah and I'll tell you what I'm what I'm going to do I'm going to make a make a phone call and get somebody somebody and you get somebody in here\nUh the measure would increase income uh for over by a thousand twenty four students it's it's a it is you know something these are the things that you find out about yeah but they don't talk a lot about ... drives me crazy\nThey're not they're not the big huge stories of touch everybody but even if it only touches a thousand people or two thousand people in a state of three million that's one or two thousand lives that says things like this the fact that when when when you think about that Connecticut as three million people but again\nYou've got Twenty one thousand here potentially without health insurance well and the big the big scheme Twenty one thousand into three million is not alive unless you're part of that twenty ... yeah well if you're one of them then it's issue number one you\nKnow this uh when I got this and I said I wanted to relate it to mention it or it's a it is just it's it's it's just\nThat Connecticut's poverty rate only slightly improve you to nine point six okay that was twenty Seventy nine points to ... to the nation's poverty rate this year a third key point for you know gravity\nSeventy nine points to ... to the nation's poverty rate this year a third Jeannie a white poor you know gravity or you know bad it's interesting ever since we had the great society programs you know the came in the late sixties with LBJ\n... the national poverty rate I read this the other day it varies all the time between Thirteen and Fifteen Percent it never gets really higher than Fifteen and it never gets really lower than Thirteen no matter\nWe're talking fifty years now since the great society and it's kind of always been at\nThat level you know and people are wondering is that a product of the capitalist system that you'll always have a certain amount of people in poverty but over five decades it really hasn't changed\nOf course it has no it was a judge in right now\nLook up stream and see how things have changed\nUh personally ah it's been whittled away and you're seeing more and more physicians such as myself leave the profession earlier because that are fed up or you're seeing a more and more physicians going into state a group situation\nBecause they're trying to have some if you will negotiate in power not practicing medicine wasn't enough now they have to a cold last to be able to negotiate contracts with the uh as you said at the end celebrities that are engaged in medicine\nSo you're are you being pushed to to see more and more and more patients in a compressed amount of time\nYes well let let me put it perhaps and in different terms right now ah thirty eight percent roughly forty percent of physicians\nAre owned or employed by a a corporate situation hospital environment some twenty five percent of all practices their bottom line when they when they assume ownership of these practices of the corporate structure that you're doing it\nThey're demanding efficiency they're demanding a bottom line quota if you will pay tens or being I'm forced to go through a process more quickly in the physician's office\nYou're going to the more patients being seen by mid levels\nMeaning nurse practitioners physicians assistants et cetera because that physicians simply can't uh they can't see that number per day or and take for instance the the hospitalist system\nIf you get admitted to a hospital today there is a very high likelihood that the physician that you know and perhaps love and have seen for Twenty years\nIsn't the one who's going to be tending to you in the hospital\nOr you will have a hospitalist assigned to you why because that position has been mandated to stay in the office and churn out those patients and that company will now has found\nThat it is much more efficient and that they had that physician drive an hour to drive back an hour to see two or three people\nKeep him or her in the office we will assign that hospitals to see you who doesn't know you you know you've seen that Dr for years and years and sixty five\nYou suddenly have them just pain or you've injured yourself and now you're in a foreign environment and that friendly face that person you know and trust isn't there\nInstead a hospitalist them young you know who he ... and most likely will be tending to you they don't have any reporter with you but again it's much more efficient\nAnd so I I think it transcend on lots of levels\nHow their patients communicate with the doctor Moore is being done through a portal system where patients can you know go on line well that's great but they don't speak the language and and so that promotes more worried and concerned\nWhen patients for lab tests that have a you know slightly abnormality and they don't know if that significant or not so then they are reaching the doctor the doctor inundated with calls therefore he can't call\nSo the mid levels call again I think it it it's a spiral of multiple events are all\nThat I Would argue is is is profit driven and so I'm I'm happy to hear that you had wonderful physicians taking care of you as have I\nBut I see in my discuss\nI'm I'm happy to hear that you've had wonderful physicians taking care of you as you have I but I see in my discussions with them how frustrated they are and they too want to get out um they're all looking for next skate proud I'd hate to say\nDoctor young yes there you just hit it out of the ballpark let me tell you something I have a couple of friends one in particular just\nRetired not so long ago tremendous just tremendous and when they talk they talk exactly like you are talking to this radio audience this morning exactly the same and you can see\nYou can see that the changes are there and really the title of the book what's wrong with America's health\nDelivery system if they could write a book I think they'd write more than one\n[laughter] yes [noise] yeah I in the illness of Madison I'd have simply tried to give a physician's perspective I'm not only of what I as a surgeon experience but my ah in tempted to\nPut down how patients were I'm complaining what they felt\nI and I wanted to do this in a manner that both sides didn't witness what the other is experiencing this is not a finger pointing book it is not a complaint book it's hopefully it'll wake up call book to say listen we've got to get control this because it is not sustainable\nIf we add the uh the problem of how we're experiencing that us and on top of the financial cough in where that is spiraling or you know we have a problem that must be addressed\nUm and and and I wanted both sides to to experience that a through reading of this book\nDr ... medicine available on Amazon do you have a another website you can point as do\nI think Amazon is probably the easiest thing I'm about ten or sites right now out of the sea ice [laughter] there are many but Amazon certainly is is the one that people can find that both on the Kindle forum soft or hard back farm\nHow much time do you believe as a doctor it would take in America for doctors to straighten this out and will they ever be able to get that kind of power\nI think it's a generation this is not a problem that occurred overnight and my experience with most problems as it takes as long to get out as it did they get in a it's not going to self\nCorrect that is for sure um but I Do think we're looking at a twenty year a generational process are we as the consumers of medicine you know it's very interesting\nYou when you go to buy a car when you go to buy any product or you can simply go online and see what the price of that car it is and you can shopping compare\nIf you were to call the hospital today and say I need my knee replaced how much would it be you will not get an answer you will get a question and that question to you will be what your insurance\nBecause the prices dictated by the insurance so until a we can control those insurance companies\nThey're going to continue to give us an opaque a\nA response to that which we are paying for the consumer we need to be able to change with our employers which insurance companies they choose in use which policies that are we the employees will indoors or\nWe need to look at how we vote or\nYou know regardless of one a one party I think we have to come together and realize that I'm from my perspective if we had a single payer we would eliminate this privatization which is costing so much and so fragmented and so I'm\nA ... inappropriate in how things are managed for something as important as your health care\nSo I I think we need to find a mechanism as many countries have to ah facilitate you know health care availability and I think we do that through how we vote\nNot eliminating the a pre existing conditions and all these things are right now Congress can't negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry for drug prices on Medicare\nAll these things are right now Congress and negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry for drug prices on Medicare or that's not right if there's no competition then again and we have lost complete control\nUm so I think there are things which company we support there are many things we have to do and I don't know if the book is going to be a calling but it certainly needs to be a wake up call that we need to take charge we just ... sit back and let the process run away from a\nDoctor I'm so glad that we were able to speak with you this morning after Michael J. or young\nThe illness of medicine and the doctor we're going to keep in touch this is a major\nMajor issue all over the United states and uh we are

I'm let's go to Richard in Texas that fake news is all over covering the protests [noise] they don't cover the Tea Party the same way I did that how do you think that Brett Kavanaugh would have

have into a Trump it has to do is they're upset\nThat the American people have rejected what they're doing and if they lose the courts the court is their agent of change for the most part the court gave them a of course same sex marriage that Obama campaigned against\nAnd Clinton said he was against and Hillary said she was against until of course the court found\nThe right to gay marriage in the constitution now that's done\nAnd they want the court to do other things like that\nAnd push the country into this direction that\nThe country wasn't going to for the most part most days talking to vote for at least not than the I think it's better to let things percolate naturally through the Democratic process\nThen you have less to ... when you short circuit big issues and big decisions like you solve with roe versus Wade in Nineteen Seventy four and in Seventy three\n... he he was short circuit the abortion issue with short circuit it meaning the court took the power from the people and decided it for themselves and then they forced did it on the rest of the country what happens\nNow all these years later decades and decades later the country's still totally divided about abortion [noise] because the issue was taken away from the people\nYou can't do that so when I talk to Steve Bannon coming up\nOn the left is rabidly camping up its base how many of you believe that the Republican Party has\nThe jolt now than it needs going until election day or is there still complacency out there or because you didn't get everything you didn't get the wall built yet that\nWe're not going to be now what what is not going to show up well if that's your attitude then you can kiss this country goodbye you have to show up you have to do it you have to vote for Republicans and then they're not perfect they don't get everything right all the time\nBut I'm telling you take out take a look at that crowd over the weekend because we'll have Maxine in charge Mazie Hirono Cory Booker Kamala Harris and that whole crowd oh I'm Sorry ...\nAll right a five five forty Laurel talk to Steve Bannon a lot more coming up\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] or your word your identity could be held hostage there should be because ransomware does exactly the losers Tom Kelly studio a biology teacher Richard every American safer from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and we're just a buck up your computer off to\nLook you're a constitutional lawyer you've been a ... you know at the highest levels how\nHow much that he was going on out decent these people\nAre across the board it's it's outrageous you know the judge Kavanaugh has never been looked at it I don't think as as cutting edge of social conservatives are area of the law he's very much for show her what I called the construction industry the state is really a a a a the second horse harness what's what Judge Gorsuch and that's the point it doesn't matter\nWhat their what they did with judge Kavanaugh is the politics of personal destruction they want to destroy people that stay in their work and I think it was very evident uh of what they did they try to destroy him and his family and it doesn't matter to put a moderate Republican up there and they'll they will try to do this\nWell and again this is and ended up showing us that you know when it when it ... when when it's needed you can have Mitch McConnell actually stand up and fight\nAnd when the Republicans are unified ... they can do anything I mean that would be nice if they were that unified on the wall and all these other things that the president wants to do\nNo maybe this is the irony of this was maybe it's the first woman as your listeners do learn a bit of a crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of anti establishment a effort I've I've no battle Mitch McConnell for many years we disagreed on on just about every topic but\nWe got to you know he he stood tall\nNormally Republicans cut and run the first under the gunfire also the social justice warriors they will work because they're afraid of being afraid of being called racist or afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shut the distance or and I think it was a seminal moment inflection point in the Republican Party\nAnd now I think we've got everybody and it's like I've said nothing but great things about the actual column for the last three or four days of the reasons he deserves the ... he really show real leadership and\nI think we've got everybody and it's like I've said\nNothing but great things about the actual column for the last three or four days of the reasons he deserves the ... he really show real leadership and did not cut and run in church kept if they'd cut and run judge kept the fight for judge Kavanaugh\nHis confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency and I think it it it it who's everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment and the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts will be you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want\nAnd that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that going forward so hopefully\nLaw this is the beginning of people saying you know we've got to work together this is what happened in six to know when I step to the campaign in August we were quite fractured everything pulled together and wasn't me it was rights pre but as it was many many people that came together to bought the grass roots\nTogether people like you with your show the brought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson ... where's the night it\nPut our differences off the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the stakes are so hot look at what happened at the look what happened at the vote\nObjects capital on the floor of the United States Senate\nLooked at many people have had given their lives to this country\nTo defend with the rule of law the federal we have that that behavior of those protesters were just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which are really kinda G the model that's coming so if you want to ... to be like the senators were harassed or an attack in the Senate\nAnd it's like kid Cruz and his wife\nWere basically a ... a bite people at a restaurant in the chase down an alley if that's what you want the future be built up but\nIt didn't bother you may have to vote for somewhere I Know is in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about how President Trump and going forward and that's what we've got to pull together\nWell we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the ah the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat\nBut these the still the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters\nWomen strongly are still supporting Democrats and some of these key races there's been a four point lead in what um the the post Washington Post in uh the shark school and they pulled a ... districts as of August twenty four and a lot has changed since then\nBut apparently it's about a four point advantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news said it's only four points\nI think it's great and it was really down from ... one poll lay audience just keep in mind when power and decided not to run the we're talking about sixty of the votes or\nThan it was fifty I went on Sean Hannity on the hundreds day to go ... I was saying is thirty five to forty now within the kill zone this is very winnable this all about human agents\nEven the post story to days a little dated 'cause it doesn't really talk about what happened after capital I think what we're going to see is remember President Trump\nWon a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton he won a high school educated white voters those you know go to space sixty nine thirty one some of the northern stubborn President Trump does resonate with women who who understand national security and women who are concerned about law and order of women who are concerned about the economy\nOr jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I Love it looked at the trend is in our favor it's trending it's trending to to uh stopping this blue wave ... and people have to understand if we stop the blue what\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious wave between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a basic cultural marks on the left turn each other apart and I think lead us to a massive victory in two thousand twenty that's why it's such urgency\nWhere people really the focus on these house districts in the in the coming in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all\nAbout you know one of the great things I Love about being a conservative a be a Republican alarm is that people understand it's about self reliance is by getting up at doing something this is a hundred percent in our hours on right now to to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\nI certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe I Know you have the movement it's called uh in Europe uh you've done some more akin to Italy we see solving any there are and other leaders I saw Le Pen\nWas meeting with solving any yesterday the day before a into trying to again ... recapture the European\nA cultural understanding or that it's been so threatened by poor leadership mass migration et cetera and where do things stand in in Europe I Know it's mhm every country is different but where things stand now\nYou know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a is actually about a year\nIn Europe I Know it's ... ... every country is different but where things stand now\nBut you know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a is actually about a year ahead of where we are in the United states that's what great it kind of came up before a brags that\nAnd the two thousand sixteenth victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked you're seeing the same thing in Europe right now ... basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots revolt you know ... evangelical\nChristian revolted soon over in Europe what you're saying is people that want their sovereignty back to their countries are tired\nOf the EU is really a global organization that's tried to take their their national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's on migration economics a whole host of other issues and you're seeing leaders like Le Pen in France or the alternative ... Deutschland leaders in Germany shell any in Italy or bon ... all\nBasically versions of the competition and there's a global trouble even in Brazil you're going to see last weekend we had a we had a a a law and order candidate\nTook the lead and all this could be the next president Brazil on a global basis you're so this whole gets kind of the secular humanists um um you know a global agenda and you're seeing people on the\nOn the right or you know start to start to take a start to take their to try and take their country's back and so I Would tell all your listeners to really focus on what's happening in Europe because I think it's great for water for the continual revolution could this continuing revolution we have here in United States to basically take the country back and let the citizens run it and that the wall street and the corporate has\nA lead in the permanent political class it's in Washington DC\nDon't get the sense that for the for the last in the global assumed people like Colin Powell who came out um last weekend or friday whenever it was like oh it's it's basically saying and it's so embarrassing for us in the world stage with Trump they would rather\nHave our country not do as well economically if it means they're not embarrassed among their liberal elite friends in Europe\nGeneral Powell ... of a lot of respect for it's just very disappointed he also doesn't really understand it seems to miss the point about eight to it and other things but President Trump just hunters were juvenile rejuvenate are alliances throughout the world with a ... at first but he's also putting them he's inextricably linked\nOr amend the economics of trade right with with our national security is the first time a virtually done it that's why you see what one little China it's just all the new NAFTA Japan's about to do a bilateral deal with the storms that you use our toes they're going to end with us\nOn China trying to shift the global supply but what are you trying to\nIs is is you know you've Nike's to and say hey they're part of a package and there's people like General Powell I mean honestly the general ... that it was kind of embarrassing because he's so detached from really understanding the details and particularly I hate to say this on NATO where the president has done more to try to rejuvenate the NATO allies by having\nThe NATO countries start to step up and pay more for their own defense for President Trump says that we're looking for allies we're not we're not we're not an imperial power\nOr not trying to be well not looking for protectors and what happened as NATO in Europe is basically a protector to the United states it's unfair to put one of the overall economy in Europe is about the same size as the United states and so people just got to step up\nConsultation cc a C.

funny my wife works where the progressive woman and at some point I don't know Bill Maher name came up and maybe spend retires\nSomething like that and she now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought Yeah Bill Maher and everyone on late\nNight and all that news outlet and MSNBC and CNN\nIt's it's weird that hey it it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the

also\nHere's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young twenty five I mean you know thirty five and one one of the guys who worked with me who's an intelligent enough guy says to me yesterday as it pertains to cabinet or he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy in there\nGet rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the paths and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record it move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that

a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not backed\nDown from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy\nWho just watches CNN and MSNBC and NBC and that's where he gets his information and he legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with Kavanaugh mhm and\nThat's to me where the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all the information and it's all going through the filter and so ... what choice what draw these conclusion if he could no he couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right ... an objective kind of understanding okay this\nThis is Kevin ... opinion zero three hundred he was a Bush guy was in the Bush White House for seven years was Justice Kennedy's Locklear come and it's not some fire breathing person is going to burn down to the Supreme Court's got yeah but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating\nThe discussion Adam to the point that people are afraid to speak out and now those images and those video clips of people like Susan Collins being cornered with her back against the law and elevator I mean I think they

not let you pay an extra hundred dollars on it a month or five hundred dollars a month you just have to pay the whole thing off or pay the payment and so what you do is you just build up a big chunk

my life on going through your now or her small art alone when I bought her car mhm I'm right now I'm I'm completely there are you right now mhm\nYou know\nWe are huge fans of people who believe which is still something indoor I can turn into millionaires original Bush started everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties when I wrote my first book\nWhen central ... was a book called the millionaire next door but Dr Tom Stanley changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know ... a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of there and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know ... million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Thompson which daughter and uh this is the first time we've ever talked on the air we talked off the air and she has a new book coming out of being blown when some of her dad's original research so Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you for having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yep and um it was a labor of love and without my father but you know it out and live I like about it\nYou know if you guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was it now\nYeah the two thousand Fifteen that's right yeah\nYeah I'm thinking I remembered that and about and I'm a we had had him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology litters around millionaires so uh you use some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and and I put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what about this or did you do and more of it was combined with what he had done\nIt yet I think that the trade so we\nWorked together really on the in this whole survey for the buck\nOn you know really started back in two thousand twelve thinking about the twentieth anniversary of the millionaire next door like that it came out in the nineties and and work together on kind of what books should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey on to our sample of African\nAmerican and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nUm and so really he wasn't able to either data that came back and compare it to what was there and Nineteen Ninety six and Andy On 'em so that's kind of where I took out a sick on the product and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points with research and technology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help\nAnd you guys have to check this out its um data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door\nIn during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore so the new data that you guys got as you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings were you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we looked a lot\nAt um some of them escaped though in that kind of behaviors that millionaire make related to investing and I think what what I was just like any that are trying to do the right thing um millionaires make mistakes along the way to an\nHour what a lot of that sort of the ... the ... the ... that they make related going back to that with the rising and then I think I think you is that why\nHasn't things in terms of the kinds of or that or the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that\nThat some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the a key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one to five things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you're playing around with\nAnd I see on the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial buddy here's what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again the it's very clear from the work that we've done but with the populations in and out every every day like I like that they are um that meant that social and different that not caring about what other than driving and buying and wearing is are really key factor\nIn building well no it's related to that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it really hard to ignore what other people are doing the actual median set forth back and continue the there are just not hearing about what other people and then you know if it is one of the way\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because\nOne of the benefits would going broke or tried to do it in my twenties were violently\nWas on yellow ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do with survive and thrive\nAnd and I reached a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor\nTo me a personal you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like he said I think that that on Facebook there isn't a lot is a lot different right and what's really going on and I live here I'm thinking of keep in mind that we definitely see that and the research\nTo gaining knowledge and composure to invest in ... well that is a great word come closer to grow ... what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know when we study that related to making deter them from the confines math but it really you know you can acquire any kind of major financial decision that you're making a few\nKind of calm yourself before making a decision so I you know the example we get sometimes there's going to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not if you're in an emotional state where\nYou are so excited about the new income level that you have it all the gardening you're making is a little off that he can stay on the income or as\nA matter of what a financial decision bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd a ... year we'd go ... personality does a career show on you're choosing my career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data\nThe idea that a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less will it actually ... the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your passion or or your entrance let's say for your career happily grounded and I'm kind of reality\nAnd I think that that's something that you know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is trailing so um if you had an accident or the art then that's really where you want your career to go um you know you have to take that with reality I mean certain things are going to be set aside for\nThat kind of again it's a ... a lot of I don't want to hear but um we ... ... ...\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody else does or accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that's one of the things that we keep saying over and over again and again let her talking about millionaires or those that are on their way to becoming the narrative at that\nTime Ben planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your whole life and not you know keeping your head and and um that that relates to building wealth and return to fit it in court thing I'd do it while\nWe're talking with Dr service Stanley follow all of 'em I'm I'm pretty much promotion you're lost my model shut it correctly\nAt la la la la la la la la yeah it's\nLike we've got one on there and watch too much with up their own children and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you have read it if you had in church and you need to reach ... new book that she did combined with her ...\nResearch project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called the ... million or next door it is now out and you need to read it\nOr you know we've got a book out called a ... called everyday millionaire and let me start if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from everyone over there is no competition\nThat's where we answer on we've been friends with them for years we'd love that she's got a book outcome in the same year that we do and we want love helping her once you go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire next door ... thank you for being with us today thank you so much I mean this is the rooms are you sure\n\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep for years and now it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I've run across some members that have been surprised me then chose the ... other people go through when they become a victim of the six\nTwenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or debt free scream and I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap

rightful all minimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process causes you to be here to there you're dead for evacuating and I'll take it that work such good family stuff right

us in Los Angeles time a gene how are you\nAre you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nTalking on the phone just give you a different background I finish up not me [laughter]\nSo um I graduated high school a few years ago and I decided to go to community college at the community college um I work I went to a work [laughter]\nUm I did about like thirty hours a week if we go to community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I mean my first semester right now [laughter] um and ... are you um you know it's a little bit harder\nSo my question was do you think I should quit my job and focus more on school how the last two years what do you think\nI should just I'm just trying hardest and an edge to both mhm what are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I went to school and for years and at the university level so um yeah uh it's doable um you are you know you're doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure uh um the um how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and food and I'm ... with the money for\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt no level of okay so if you quit work how would you pay for school I had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't mind I think I think it will\nProbably like call of mhm we left me a year you know I think I keep working\nOkay\nIt's a ... year if it costs you half a point on your grade point average um\nYeah I heard about it my GPA yeah\nI graduated with a tune on seven\n\nI missed it as a magnet by I'm just making about ... when I'm Still piss Thirty years later but [laughter] but\nYou know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before this my advice [laughter] and I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they as my GPA in my entire life ever around in if you're wanting to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world they might ask your GPA and you might actually be\nIn competition or Juppe I might actually matter\nOn your very first job but after that one um and it it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kind of stuff\nAnd so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay a poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them I'd actually are you for your degree\nYeah that's what I was thinking too\nYou know wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if we can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool\nOn top of it but I'm I'm\nYou know you're not working a hundred hours a week you were going thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this it's very doable uh most people work when they're in school\nIt's not that unusual really by the way when I when I Do and I was in\nI was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing an event we sit right Chris Hogan asked the audience were three thousand people or how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raised their hand\nNow maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but it appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for asking um I don't know if I get back on here and my husband and I were in baby steps you getting out of that and now we are and what you call the dream team and make them for their down payment on or how to be an astronaut on the weird looking right now at about\nA great thing about them I frequent down um\nOur household income before I'm On the back and forth about one twenty five I'm after bonuses I think it's about one thirty two and so I'm trying to make sure that I don't know about like how much how I um that we are understanding the um\nI I I think you recommend and I forgive your take home pay exactly a okay perfect and thought I wanted to make sure that like right now where I prayed with a million markets calculators and right now we're kind of had a funny one hundred I'm I'm One of them\nAnd the ball comfortable amount and I'll hang out at it and I think number you know and it was big now that\nIt's a lot better [noise] [noise] you're paying now but if that's ... that's ... a fourth of your take on pay or less and your debt free with your emergency phone and blows you have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget\nAnd stay on track but again\nThat's not what you should do that's the most you should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put on a shorter term if you want to and and you know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years\nThere's nothing wrong with it on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment\nIs no more than a fourth of your take home pay\nLook is one of those in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\nID very better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have a rich room to you for many years actually I my dad got me let's do when I was a young kid and I'm like stupidly I did not take your bike and I have student loans and um [noise] we are can during taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo knock out the high interest you know ... and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much do what I'm doing it Jeremiah student loan but the you know he um read it forty eight thousand during and what's your household and [noise] it\nWas actually Twain takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring home ... forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a\nRefinance take Arab to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither ... and so on now I I've never told anybody do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you write enough money to pay this debt off on a couple of years um you're going to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life but then you're going to be dead free accept your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm\nFrom there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we want people to groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt and on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nWe're going to go in and also fast as black you're keeping in for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is about forty eight thousand for two years or twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget\nReally really tight budget very careful very dolled in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part\nBut no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of there and work in your way out of a whole digging out of a whole is a an oxymoron statement that we all make which I'm doing you know you're not digging out of all if you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper\nShe can't dig out of a home you have to fill in the whole ice getting him to climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China to work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle little on the sand and say well now borrowing money\nEver ever ever ever ... show [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOh\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big supporter\nBut it really needs to be a part of an 'cause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much did everybody had\nAnd were like wow like ... you know this is a support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps ... and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps a much uh we had about ten thousand so\nThat was hard for a nerd was judge ... to\n... takes your breath away so Veronica ... goes to a class you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go much sure I like this\nWell it wasn't so much that I didn't like it I just I felt like I needed like I said strategies to help me 'cause I I didn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as we've all the time it was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went aha I see that now\nEverything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles and and with him being dinner that he is and then me just coming to my senses and saying you know is this\nIs this material things something that I really need to have men are using the ... the ... system really helped me come and knock out our budget and ... you know this is the amount of money we need\nTo pay for our groceries and says you know this is how much we we can get to the church and this is how much we can give people up for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out\nAnd once we implemented those steps I you know we're just like\nHere on the little bit like Rachel ridge agrees that a budget is permission to spend\nI Love your daughter permission to spend okay\nYeah yeah and that's exactly what it is I there is sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money and that's the mindset I had to give myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we wanted it but in ... you know when it's coming down from a budget\nBut once I started I let it control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader window your brother was a cheerleader and you have the community that you're plugged into richer leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader I think\nAnd uh I mean we're really close to our family and my family they're all of them are very supportive of us we we both come from five brothers ours but not by brown [laughter] five kids from each family so two brothers and sisters so we have we come from a big family but um\nThey were all supportive of us really and our friends and as well so\nAre cool so what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page\nAnd our communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial piece for they've gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it would just really explode once they get through that and and follow the ... the steps\nAnd just you know riding down our goals was really important for us to do and once we had that you know are very cool driven um especially being in sales jumped you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and so just staying focused and dedicated and discipline\nAnd really really helped us you know\nAnd well you guys from Bert proud of you\nVery well done your couple to lessen Rajoy the marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy goes are both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny and they're both funny on the green room to by the way that I mean\nIt's the same thing so wow well done well done we've got a copy of of course opens book for you which are inspired what that would be the next chapter in your story that you're no millionaires and you're well on your way\nAnd then of course are outrageously generous as you go along very very well done I'm proud of you\nAll right Ron embryonic I used to do\nIt all been Seventeen months making one to on the one thirty ... what's your uh British going three two one for\nThe fun of them as a ... throughout their lives is good [noise]\nAll I needed was strategy all and he was a strategy ... we got to get on the same page would go to get on the same pitch communication\nOr the budget here it over and over and over again don't ship [noise] Seoul tonight to turn off the TV would get stupid [noise] get off the guards in the scissors and over ... million\nAbruptly every dollar up through your first budget [noise]\nBecause you work too hard to be

breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day loses one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or

never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that\nYou know K. underlings okay but\nIt's fun so there there are no help is what you're saying okay\nI don't know how but they they ... they're they're good but they're just I don't know how\nI Know that all behaviors obvious\nWe have a psychology involved\nUm as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment to treat it only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment\nBut um there there's something that you're obviously searching for and there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know that um but um [noise] I I don't know honestly\nI I think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong\nHow can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation\nAnd it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely you know but you can be it's very very real\nUm the saw the last component I Would add to it um and you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that\nAnd and sit down and get pastoral counseling to go with your other counseling\nGet with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character have some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there\nAre at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book that are in a God I Know you're Jewish okay cool that's perfect then let's get one of the rabbi dude\nLet's get the spiritual element of those going because there's a there's an aspect\nOf that goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful on the bike cause the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with\nUm a lot and um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy\nYou've already realize this is ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is ... and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that\nOne of the thing is you realize you're powerless and you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately\nAnd so how do I fix it was more wisdom and that would be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up\nI'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends\nWhich doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more grows\nSo um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you\nUm then that's very important I've

to continue on us because I make a new point as the only major conservative TV outlet I say they're like a public utility and yet they're engaging the same censorship as Twitter and Facebook\nYou know you can't have it both ways all the conservative screaming about Twitter and Facebook censoring them and their right to do so and Twitter and Facebook should not be allowed to do that\nWhy well although they're private companies they become so large and so dominant they are like public utilities and based on that argument the same can be applied to Fox News ... because as a conservative outlet and the only conservative outlet and television\nIt is like Facebook and Twitter for conservatives is it not so if they blacklist someone like me and I'm not the only one but I'm the most prominent one\nI Am a best selling author I'm revered by millions and yet\nBecause of personal vendettas within that company and outright fear of an ignoramus she'll never graduated high school the pretends to be a great genius and I've been told a straight up front for Twenty years\nHe's terrified people will find out how stupid he actually is he is as empty as the as the left says about him he knows nothing he's nothing but a script reader\nAnd yet he runs Fox News like the Nineteen fifties cardboard factory in Brooklyn New York think of a smokestack industry\nOr a boss ran around like a little tyrants that's what Fox News has become\nAnd so therefore yeah I'm angry of course I'm angry that isolated like this of course I'm pissed off that you people who are good are easily hoodwinked by everyone who sits there and smiles at you'll make believe they're your friend and they're out for America they're not out for America they're all out\nFor themselves [noise] make no mistake about it it's a business like any other and they answer to a higher power\nAnd Fox News is Eighteen percent owned by a Saudi businessman you get to you have to picture of who makes the Fox news or shows with or without the shoes and the legs\nUnderstands that knowledge is power without knowledge you have no power when I come back we have a surprise for you yes a real surprise editors about stop mass hysteria it's out today\nPlease go and check it out for yourself you will not be able to walk out I guarantee you not be able to walk out for thirty minutes if you start reading that book\nJoy ... eight five or four hundred server [noise]\nStopped George Soros and his paid agitated before they ignite a civil war in the United states remember I alerted you to borders language and culture they are trying to destroy this nation stop mass hysteria\nThere's a specially after the way Kavanaugh was treated I think that the secret voter\nThe silent majority of the I'm not going to have to define as they get the white male in some cases the white woman has had enough of this\nThey have sons daughters they have sons they have uncles their brothers and they know that the man and the male has been targeted in this country unfairly and they worry for their children so I'm not sure so sure it's a guarantee sweep 'em to laugh\nBut I Want to talk for a minute Arab before we go about racism and bigotry because\nIn my book under a this topic in mass hysteria\nI said that racism and bigotry you have to defining parts immorality and their legality the problem for progressive ...\nIs that the first is subjective and often clashes with the ladder for example the bakery that refuses to make a cake for gay couple went any entrenched group feels threatened by a newly formed identity be they marry gays free blacks or transplant that Hispanics\nWho don't necessarily speak the language\nIs stereo on the local and national level is invariably that result how that is manifest whether by the formation of the Ku Klux Klan or massive deportations\nDepends entirely on the wisdom and broad based compassion of our leaders\nThat you'll notice in that paragraph that's not really exactly a right wing position is\nNo not as some of the other things and and that's what I Love about you by the way it's like you don't do what the mass hysteria by the way sometimes on both sides do and that is is group think enough of that already we look at each issue independently it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican and it's so refreshing that that you do that\nWell first of all I'm an older American male number to form a social worker I Am the son of an immigrant actually to immigrants so I grew up with one foot in the old world one foot in the new so I tend to see things in a multiplicity of ways or through a totality of ways\nAnd I want to I Want to close with one line that I actually had the book closes with a line that I Hope will be some benefit to America I kinda doubt it\nAnd I write this I said one of his many squeeze it plays on words Benjamin Franklin set of Americans just before you fix the signature on a declaration of independence we must indeed all hang together or most surely we should hang separately does\nThat not apply today\nAnd applies exactly to what has been happening not just with Kavanaugh in this case but with all these years against 'em you against other people in the media and and it can absolutely go if if for example the me too movement can also be used against Democrats and people are going to sit there and use it as a\nPolitical weapon and so it looks like the pendulum swing way too far\nAnd you're pointing out that this mass hysteria and the guillotine at the end of the day comes for everybody if that's what you if that had a revolution\nThat's right that's our push you seen as a Thursday blade\nIt has no political affiliation\nAnd when the left starts dropping it on the right and then the women started dropping it on demand they don't understand what will happen next study any revolution whether it be a lot of mouths China Soviet revolution bullshit rex rather or um Castro's Cuba after they got to killing their enemies they started killing each other struggling for power\nAnd so you know Aaron when the left has removed all the statues of Columbus as they want to do in New York all the Confederate flags\nAll the monuments to our founding fathers wouldn't books like mine I've been burned to remove from libraries when we have allowed hysterical cries to terminate or terrorized rational discourse\nAs I write we will all I've become a cop to me there and my son is ... and those who are wrecked a testament to their own infamy with the bones of others\nI Would I mean by that is we're all potential victims of hysteria doesn't matter what side you're on and what I'm suggesting to people listen to this broadcast and read stop mass hysteria take a deep breath before your vilify your enemy biggest tomorrow it may be you\nAnd learn what is happening in society today and the way that you can do that is is by the book stop mass hysteria America's insanity from the sand them

eighty nine Ninety nine do you want to see\nThe oh yeah well I guess we can look there was some Trump beer a President Trump\nIs speaking ah he's outside of the White House and uh I I guess we can listen to a little bit of the president this was just a moment to go\nUnder one very just before [noise] and then some people because they do good happen but you know good anywhere from I Would say one or two to four additional so we'll see I don't know I'm very\nHappy the way it is right now we put a great man and I wanted to be a great yarn boring but you know\nIt begins to give you know what what is it on or is that there have been residents many residents and never had a shortage and here I Am not even two years that we have to do and they are confirmed and around the\nFor three separate rounds of sanctions against North Korea last year and those sanctions were the centerpiece\nOf Trump's maximum pressure campaign now without the surgeon folks I don't think there would have been ah any progress at all on at least even the talk of the ...\nIt was on loan now bottom line here is I remain ultimately very skeptical of the the North Koreans and Kim Jong il and they've rope a dope dumps they they run us in circles for decades here when it was Kim Jong on his father prior to that and the ... the Clinton Administration you know through the Bush administration so I I\nI don't give up much uh\nUltimate hope here because I just I I think that the north Koreans going to have a very tough time denuclearize the end of the president discuss that earlier today but you know had to pay a little less talk a little more action please we're just not seeing any real significant\nAction out of the north Koreans and must essentially has been out of there and play well they've done the same thing they talk they'll talk about talking Oh yes let's have talks about having talks and they brag stuff out they make promises commitments and\nThey don't follow through so the question is\nIf there is someone that can change this it is you know Trump who can be somewhat ironic as well and\nIf anyone can change this trajectory with North Korea\nI think it is President Trump but again I'm not bamboozled is swindled by the north Koreans and\nAgain we just haven't seen any concrete action and\nThe president needs to push harder on that\nYou know but with you know North Korea you know Trump delivered the rhetoric and you had Nikki Haley who essentially delivered the sanctions Nikki Haley did the heavy lifting and this country owes her a great debt of gratitude there's no doubt about it\nAnd the resignation on Nikki Haley this morning you know it seems to come out of nowhere you know catching everyone by surprise him including apparently even secretary of state Mike Pompeo a national security adviser John Bolton bought [noise] yeah as\nI mentioned last hour you know one of the possible scenarios in rumblings is is that they're more hard liners and they actually sort of pushed\nA for Nikki Haley's departure but the story the Nikki Haley is saying that he and then she actually told Trump over plans to leave or six months ago and leaving at the end of this year and certainly if that's what happened\nThen the timeline is certainly on track here uh you know most of them is highly unusual for secretary of state to be aware or or you know the intention of the U.S ambassador\nTo the United nations but again this is a different kind of a White House [laughter]\nWe see different stuff all the time you know and she didn't have any personal reasons you know I'm Wondering if it's you know the monetary issue she wants to make some money I you know we'll we'll see we'll see what Nikki Haley ends up doing will go back to the ... lines coming\nBack it a little
