back\nIn American society the you know all the antifa marches and the you know the nonsense and the violence and the shouted threats and a visiting senators' offices or not their offices their homes in the middle of the night all of that will end when you give us power back\nOr are we going to be able to you know are we going to be able to have a civil society or or the Democrats simply going to say will cause trouble 'til you give us the reins of power back\nWell that's a review and looked at I mean I don't know how much lower you go then accusing someone to participating in organizing Gingrich [laughter]\nOut without any evidence whatsoever of but apparently they and according to Politico the Democrats think that there are the lessons from the capital experiences they need to be more ruthless ... just ... mind boggling more ruthless and they've been the ... that we are are we are just\nRude that we're just friends of built in the pursuit of power will do anything to get power\nAnd their two principled into kind and too soft and so you know they're they're they're that's they they need to be tougher as what they're taken from all of this which is just you know I mean the fact of the matter is that the what the left always does first of all do they have it there are two reasons why Brett Kavanaugh was on the Supreme Court than they are both both the Democrats number one\nThey filibustered Neil Gorsuch and as a result the Republicans went nuclear do you think for a second that Mitch McConnell would have been able to muster the votes last week to go push the nuclear option to wreck\nHaving on the port of course not so the the reality is that they they screwed themselves by filibustering it perfectly qualified a universally respected justice upper the Supreme Court and so that they had no power\nWhatsoever to stop Kavanaugh and then the second thing is they always overreach you know ... that Christine Blasey Ford you know her story started falling apart but at least there was some she seemed credible to most most Americans\nDisassociate volunteer or something then they start coming up with a temper a mirror store hit piece in the New Yorker and then Michael ... comes out with this ridiculous you know these were ridiculous the affidavit that you know he was standing in line to wait his turn with girls and you know all the rest of it and then gang rapes and just it it you know they overreached\nAnd so the lesson is not to to to do more of that at the lesson that mean that literally helps confirmed Brett Kavanaugh because there are charges are so ridiculous that Republican Senate ... said to themselves look this is just absurd\nUh and I don't believe they do those charges and Bob the orders probably not ... not true either so they actually they actually helped Kavanaugh's case by going overboard and by with their attacks on first on Gorsuch and then on Kavanaugh so the lesson is be smarter something stupid\nI guess I Hope you don't mean by and I think the Democrats may say being smarter means we have to have a better pack of lives that are less track of all you know and and a better set of stories and I hope they don't do that\nBut frankly mark look I Know I'm critical of the media and I mean to me I'm part of the media but I'm critical of the mainstream because I don't think they're doing their jobs and I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if you joined me in this because\nYou remember when when David Duke was supposed to have endorsed Donald Trump and and they said well I mean Donald Trump has to displaying that connection right away Well Mark I guarantee you there or at least a few people listen to my show who may be nasty\nIndividuals you know I think the vast majority are nice folks but I don't know everybody to listen to my show there are millions of people in the radio audience so you know somebody says hey there's this full on begun from Alabama who just he loves your show and he hates everybody in the world because of their skin color race religion et cetera and I say my response would be I don't control would people think\nAnd the fact that he likes my show or endorses my candidate for mayor dog catcher whatever does not really mean much of anything unless I embrace that endorsement well in this case I'm not seeing any made any members of the mainstream media going to politicians right or left\nAnd saying and especially in the ... go to Nancy Pelosi go to Barbara Barbara Boxer and Chuck Schumer and the rest and say will you condemn these tactics the tactics where violence is done where you know ... protests\nAnd Chuck Schumer and the rest and say will you condemn these tactics the tactics where violence is done where you know ... protests are made and and you show up into senators house in the middle of the night and harass his wife things like will you do that\nThey will go to Donald Trump in believer in for a week to say please come out and displaying David Duke which I think at the end of the day he did um but but they're not doing any of that in a case like this so they pick and choose when does say it's a major story this week that they know that that senator so and so will or won't a disclaimer\nThis kind of behavior or by people who were advocating against Brett Kavanaugh\n... is there any reasonable explanation for why reporters would say well it's not important to ask\nThem it's a blast yeah they're biased I mean that the why doesn't say I honestly there's so many older than ... story and that somebody an investigative journalist ought to be going out and saying was there some coordination here was this whole plant\nA ... you know the way it is let's do talk to people enter high school and find out a little bit more about her a let's talk to let's find out like\nOr is there coordination between Senate Democrats in her lawyers or how did the story leak why I mean we why we still don't know how ... letter of came out and to the press there there's a there's a lot of stuff that that is worthy of investigation and I don't think any of them but I Do it\nYou know they have no curiosity it at all because it doesn't I mean they were to find out yesterday metals\nLast October so why why should they why should they a waste any energy\nI mean they can spend all kinds of time on on other lesser things like you know whether or not to certain people in the Trump Administration at very low levels of campaign or you know allied with somebody else but in this case where it actually controlled whether or not a man would become the Supreme Court justice that he is today\nOr whether his he'd be ruined and his name be smart forever um no not very odd city there at all and and and I just\nI just wonder if these reporters are having any self awareness of saying we're\nBecause they'll tell you that they're unbiased that their objective\nJournalism they're just telling the news well then why not treat those stories equivalent because the Duke example is maybe a poor one but there are lots of examples where the press will spend inordinate amounts of in time and energy tracking down is there a connection here or not and you had this one is like not not even interested in looking into it\nWas just I mean the address is really just in the cloud itself and the whole philosophy for them and just to see the is a an eddy charges like they're that or even credible to treat the Ramirez story like that was credible I mean is it just it they\nYou know they they complain when Donald Trump talks about fake news but then they ... the whole fake news me him\nJohn Wilkes booth if you think about the people who have committed political assassinations Lee Harvey Oswald not exactly a right wing conservative if you know what I mean and so the left uses these kinds of tactics there right does not\nWent in TV shows up in your town be sure to have the fire department and sublease an ambulances on hand\nWhen the Tea Party shows up on the Capitol mall in Washington DC they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived [noise] so is there a reason to do that this isn't pointed out routinely I Know that most reporters working for TV channels\nThey want to find a kind of a moral equivalence well both sides do it\nActually that's not true is not backed up by the facts is not backed up by history\nSo when somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only returned when the left gets its power back it reminds me of a four year old in the grocery store in the cereal aisle\nWith mom who is screaming at the top of his lungs holding his breath wild ... screaming you can't be holding his breath but he's screaming at the top of his lungs and stamping his feet and civility is only going to return when the captain crunch goes into mom shopping basket\nWe understand it it's not rational behavior but it is the kind of behavior you expect perhaps from juvenile children\nIt is not the kind of behavior that America ought to have to tolerate coming from adults simply because they identify with the left side of the trial let's go to Cindy Cindy welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind tonight\nOh hello life I was told that fish they want to do is get civil eighth\nYou very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time on your point\nWhen I did get the ...\nThank you very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time on your point\nOkay I thought the Democratic tide deplorable there's ... and at the end taxpayer money trying to cap and not be a sexual predator and then turn around and finance Hillary Clinton on a democratic rally tore\n... when he has been guilty of sexual predator Clinton as the guy that a child to have an odd the\nYeah and you did you notice Hillary Clinton saying well the charges against my husband she actually said this week are were different the accusations were different when\nI read that I thought yeah they were different because the charges against I mean Bill Clinton never contested that he had sexually harassed\nAnd molested Kathleen willy who came to the oval office asking for help and never contested that he had to elicit an illicit affair with Monica you know uh and and he never did no of course he would not admit that he raped Juanita Broderick but that story is so well founded and well evidence\nAnd one is Roderick who's been on this program not long ago just for a couple of weeks ago during the whole cabinet business\nUm she explained that she\nTold somebody about the assault the rate that Bill Clinton\nPut her through within thirty minutes of it happening and she remember the details you then\nTold other people in her close circle of friends and she told them why she feared reporting it because the man who had raped her Bill Clinton was the attorney general and he controlled the industry in which she owned two nursing homes the attorney general of Arkansas that time maybe still\nControls the nurse ... nursing home business he had the power to put her out of business so you know Bill Clinton was accused accurately sewing Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was in what she meant but it's what my response would be your bed it was it was a different\nThe charges against Kavanaugh were unfounded on evidence to non proved and the charges

it's called the free Sally brand no we don't do commercials for them although I think you can sell like crazy ten percent of America is diabetic and I have to keep an eye in my blood sugar has never bug me to you know use a little stick thing to\nStick your finger and get a drop of blood and tested but it's kinda disgusting if you you know I wouldn't want to sort of doing it next to me on an airplane or restaurant this thing is a little sensor about the size of two quarters stacked on top of each other\nAnd it sits on my on on either right or left arm you can put it on your biceps backwards not going to get brushed off and it sticks with some really incredible glue and it stays there for ten days and anytime you want to check what your sugars you just take those little meter\nAnd you hold it up next when it goes beep and it's not just measuring it at that moment it's get records it are you on while he's on your arms so if I don't check it all day long and then I hold the thing up their downloads all the data from the last you know seven or eight hours or whatever and it gives you a little grafted shows you here's where you ought to be and here's where you've been you know so\nWhen I eat salad for lunch or whatever and the numbers are still in good shape it's it's a good deal and those stupid little finger stick things uh that I've been using for the last four years or so they're expensive and I know everybody says well insurance pays for it will remember\nWe're all paying for the insurance so those things can run you a buck a strip and you might check your blood sugar four or five times a day for five\nBucks a day it's a little sensor my arm is about thirty bucks and last for ten days so it can actually be cheaper than the other version and you can actually kind of track and say oh I just said this what they do to my blood sugar if I had something an hour ago\nAnd it's it's really kind of cool and you know I like gives ... anyway so I thought I thought I'd tell you and and actually if I wanted to or needed to I can plug this thing into a on a pad or a computer and transmit all the data to my doctor not that that's necessary in my case but I kind of a cool deals so\nWell it's also good and for things like that whether it be your car your body or whatever to keep track of how things are going over time you know there's a nominally I have a lot of people that say well my phone you know doesn't last forever ... do you know what forever even need\nI mean did it ever last ten hours it ever go eight hours and they said well just seems like you know are my computer's wanting slower my our guys all these things\nOr whether it be your blue your blood level your blood sugar levels or or your car range gas mileage if you don't keep track of

I don't know why because I said to my doctor I don't understand was prescription anyway and I'm not\nAsking for a bottle of Oxitec I'm a I'm asking for a meter it's is like getting a prescription for a tape measure and she said well I don't either but but uh but you have to have one so I got as long as you know all our and I said hey I Want to buy one of these and they go now cancelled so you have to have prescription like what was\nOnce do stupid and and frankly the little cheaply meters at Walmart they're like twelve bucks and you don't need a prescription and districts are twenty or thirty cents apiece so it's just you know you can save some money but there's a beauty if you actually made people pay for it I think the prices would come down but because they're like oh it's covered by insurance and they\nSo they just say well we can charge you know\nI my wife was stunned a few years ago I said well you pick up a bit beyond fifty tester and so I was using one of these one touches and they were All right and she comes back and says fifty stripped of sixty five dollars on what why well out of the game and the insurance companies anyway let me ask you about this let me ask you about gender filters on job sites\nIs that a form of discrimination\nAnd is it legitimate for a company to say we're more interested in males or females in this particular job and do you think they're\nDoing it and yeah and it and then the question whether what they're doing it or not we'll get two and a second and I'm going to ride the fence on the side and I know you hate that but let me give you both sides of the coin here on side number one the argument is they want more diversity and higher and they want the candidate pool they won't page one page to page three of the results to reflect\nThe overall mix of gender now the reason they haven't had\nAny consideration and I believe develop or is it linked and now of course owned by Microsoft had done a really good job of keeping gender out of the equation\nThe developers have said we don't want to even enter that into the data pool we don't want to know about it because it's not necessarily relevant now what they're saying they're saying well we want to encourage diversity by subtly encouraging if there's a a sixty percent female applicants indoor pool of responses to your linked to an ad\nWe're going to put sixty percent of females on page one sixty percent of females on page to and so on and so forth so I get the intent I get the goal I get the purpose I'm just not sure that I Want my technology provider like linked in can be shoveling the result in such a way they could consciously or unconsciously\nDetermine who I hire I Believe the best candidate should be hired guard lists of race and that's where the ... question comes in or we now putting that\nFront and center on the same token I think we can all agree anything that helps that company be much more diverse is a good thing so it's really\nActually I'd probably disagree with you there just because look if you're going to ask for the best\nCandidates Brian if God Forbid you end up in the hospital you you've probably been once or twice in a show on that\nI'd been there with family members I haven't been in the hospitals are patients\nSince I was a kid but if you do that what gender will be the predominant gender among nurses I Would say female female and I've looked at the numbers had something like eighty five to Ninety percent so should we told the hospitals will you should filters so that the job candidates you look at her fifty\nFifth actually fifty one female forty nine men\nWould you accept that and say you have to leave it\nNo go ahead if if the if the market is eighty five if you say you walk into a hospital the market is eighty five percent female\nAnd and you get eighty five percent female applicants now that number may vary five ten percent one way or the other but at the market as a whole is eighty five percent you know\nYou're gonna get eighty five percent female applicants so the question is not are you getting the applicants in the first place the question is are you seeing the same mix of applicants page after page after page well and the results would ultimately be the same\nI guess I I Would just rather they rank order people and said here the people with the best test scores are the best one ever metric you want to use a measure\nTheir capabilities and and give us those candidates well it turns out they're all female or almost all female sold her well do I want the best ...

there are a lot of people who may be ready to get a job but do they have the skills to fill those jobs Peter Murphy is vice president of the invest in education go Lucian Mr Murphy welcome to the program\nLars thank you for having me great to be with you\nSo tell me this um [noise] we have a situation in America where we have a record low level of unemployment\nI tell people that I'll be sixty next year in the last time we are the unemployment is low for the whole working population was one I was a nine years old and the last time we had female unemployment is low I was a bunch of dream and my parents are Isaac was Nineteen fifty three\nSo if we have this record low level of unemployment we have a lot of employers hiring and we have some ... millions of Americans who are willing I I I don't know if they're willing to work but as far as I'm concerned if they're working age they ought to be working\nDo we really need to provide tax incentives to ah to get employers to fill those jobs\nLars me up too many Americans that don't have the skills to fill the jobs and I think that's really what this is about it's not a kind of an open ended a tax\nCredit thing we're talking about here at the bill that we are pushing a ... by a congressman Lloyd Smucker Pennsylvania\nCalled the usa workforce tax credit act that would allow upped two billion dollars a year\nA it's a fairly modest some but it's some it's another spoken this we'll another a policy that would compliment other efforts that are designed to get more young people in particular a skill ready to take these jobs that are going unfilled right now\nIf I go old fashioned on you because I'm now old socially and I say well if I wanted to learn construction and I I was I said fine if I'm going to get off my up and go out and get a job and I'm unemployed even in a in a situation of an economy that seems to offer employment in all directions and employers begging for that\nAnd I'm unemployed even in a in a situation of\nAn economy that seems to offer employment in all directions and employers begging for that I think I'd go to a construction site or a construction company and say can you put me to work and they always need people who are what I called mirror fog or somebody who can fog mirrors qualified\nWho say you can start sweeping up you know I mean there's a cleanup guy in every construction crews sometimes more than one and\nWhen the young man's or one young woman says but I Want to learn how to do drywall or hammer nails or I Want to I Want to learn how to pour concrete and finished concrete and say well we can teach you how to do that um but you got to start at the bottom and if you did that\nI Would imagine that is the people who've been the mirror fog or jobs before move up the ranks that there will be gaps\nThey're an aren't some of the jobs that are available or that can't be filled or it's a tough time to fill them in those kind of categories where people just say I don't want to do that job doesn't sound very interesting that sounds physically challenging and it doesn't pay very much money but that's where all of us including me started in our jobs doing the jobs nobody else wanted to do\nBoth from yours truly I mean my summer jobs didn't look too glamorous but I got a lot out of it and uh and build from it so\nI'm really what we're trying to do to do is to get a more Americans skill ready for these positions there's not enough to fill them and we're not moving quickly enough to\nGet people to a skill level and I think too many young people are going to college which is not the right choice for every\nPound couldn't agree with you on that and I think you know even industry is responding\nTo that by going to job fairs and sending representatives and going to guidance counselors and saying we've got five figure ... figure jobs here\nThat these young people can fill in the ... in a year or two and nine and her college says the same time so a lot of it's just industry having to take extra steps that they didn't have\nTo take before um and we're offering to accelerate that process so we don't go month after month year after year potentially trying to grow at four or five percent and then the economy\nAnd not feeling these jobs I mean there's other risks with that that you know we don't want companies going elsewhere or overseas to fill positions or or move operations or anything so\nSo it it just designed to you know we we have a job for and they have the government spending programs to a career in technical education let's let's get the private sector more involved in\nBuilding these positions in in investing in workers and ... and then adding more apprenticeship opportunities and end of school choice component to this bill as well or getting children in a better school though they're graduated college and career ready as opposed to sit too many of them now who are neither\nLaura took so this will be two billion dollars as a practical matter how has the money gets spent so if if I'm an employer and hire somebody who's currently unemployed has been unemployed for six months when I get the credit or how does it actually worked\n... ... the way it would work is the\nThe investor the and the the employer uh would go to the Treasury Department and actually apply for the tax credits up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth\nApply for them in a rent either a random selection or first come first served the Treasury Department will do then is to the program\nA and this is done at the state level in other areas where you literally apply for a finite number of tax credits\nMac with the ceiling of two billion a year or those employers would apply for them and uh they get approval almost like you're going for a concert tickets on line or something it's a similar kind of process and the cat you know automated process and they get the credits and make the investment\nAnd you know report that accordingly and\nBut when you make the investment does that mean they say I Will hire somebody who is not currently employed into a job and I'll provide them the training to like I said if it's construction to do she rocked to do framing to do a you know a concrete foreign Yoon finishing ... what do they have to actually do\nYou like I'm gonna I'm gonna spend X amount of dollars at this community college to to hire or to\nTrain a four thousand students to prepare them for this line of work or I'm going to I'm I'm partnering with uh this state workforce agency to a an X number of apprenticeships in these areas and\nThat's that's basically I mean that they have to be an application process and all that\nUm but it's if it's going to the ... the government getting the you know making the application getting the credits and making the investment after that\nWilling to what you propose Cubans two billion dollars the taxpayers' money\nYou know making the application getting the credits and making the investment after that willing to what you propose\nIf it's two billion dollars the taxpayers money one thing that would make me happier\nAbout it is a big and making relatively revenue neutral and I would address the college question you raised I Wish we forced everybody wanted to apply for any kind of loan\nYou know unless if you want to go pay for college out of your mom and dad's bank again go for it I don't care what you start you can study I can bring up a provide yeah well and\nThat's that's how most of us did I did it that way and and you know I didn't finish but that's that's that but if you said to them if we sit down with the unions say I want to spend two hundred thousand dollars on a degree to get a job as a social worker paying forty two thousand thirty two thousand dollars a year who say that doesn't pencil we're not giving you a ...\nAnd we're not giving you know to go study something where you invest a gigantic amount of money and make a in somebody else's money that you're borrowing and then you'll expect somebody else paid off\nSo if you did it that way and and made it to pay for I think they caught on Capitol Hill or you say the money was said by not spending it on people getting you know degrees in a you know left tended French literature or something that they don't have any practical application will pay for the kid who actually does want to learn how to weld\nLarge they're making way too much but I I I think that ship I I think that and I was going at it and put how do you put that back in the bottle right actually putting a bit of a criteria I mean look the things we do for our to our own jaws on the government's not going to do\nTerrorists I'm afraid we're not originally from our country the media we immediately leap and say oh it must be the Tea Party she pretty who did this it was not us\nTime after time after time after time and\nI I resent it completely reinvent the way that they're trying to say that the out I'll outrageous unlawful behavior that is leading to more and more violent that we're seeing from the left is anything like that group of people who I had worked side by side with for nearly the last decade\nYou know I'm going to make a comparison and I think this is something we can work with I made it earlier tonight when I was talking to a friend of mine and I said uh you remember when David Duke was alleged to have endorsed Donald Trump it turned out he had not in Donald Trump disclaimer the connection\nBut the media went you know crazy trying to tell the president if some crazy man\nWho's affiliated with the Klan endorses you you have to immediately come out and and\nI guess you're not recanted you've never accepted the endorsement and I'm sure there are people who maybe have unsavory attitudes based on race religion or otherwise you say I Love the Lars Larson Joe well I don't control of people think so somebody told me there's some big it\nWho live somewhere in California that really love your show I'd say okay I got nothing I can do about it he's entitled to think whatever crazy things he was offensive though they may be this on my fault you know because I I didn't ask\nFor his endorsement and and so the reason I'm bringing this up as the media extend it\nExpended a huge amount of time and energy telling the president that if somebody unsavory endorses him\nThat he would have to come out and condemn that endorsement and condemned the Klan okay on that same basis I Would like to see people start showing up at whatever public events democratic candidates and Democrat office holders are holding and I mean federal\nAs well as local folks around America and say will you condemn the acts of violence by left\nWing extremists in this country and I'm willing to bet that most of the folks out there running for reelection all the members of the house and the third of the Senate on the Democratic side will not want to do that they they will not want to condemn it\nAnd and the problem is right now the mainstream media isn't even bothering to ask the question and I think to some extent if you could get major office holders to condemn this kind of thing from the left that it would have some effect\nBecause right now they're happy to just sit back and let these extremist go out set fire to things and and enjoy what they think is the benefit of it without having without having to be asked\nAre you endorsing this is this something that that you believe in and because of the mainstream media is in the position where they are the ones who should be asking them\nOn the the means to me it should be asking them but they're not they're not going to ask them because the people on the left are they elected officials and the people here the left with Jewish leaders are getting them up and pouring\nFuel on the higher Eric Holder kitty oh when we when we met that Michelle Obama was wrong to think when they go\nWell on the higher Eric Holder kitty oh we when we met that Michelle Obama was wrong to say when they go low we go high noble you know knew when they go low we kick them yeah\nI Know what it's like to be kicked by Eric Holder and the IRS and that the Obama administration so yeah that's exactly\n[laughter] exactly the kind of behavior I Would expect from our former attorney general Maxine Waters hauling for violence chasing down on supporters of the president wherever you can find them a gas station the birds or the department stores wherever you can't\nDo left took her up on that we see that time after time and now Hillary Clinton think well it's on\nAnd we're not going to be civil to people who disagree with us because they're trying to undo what we did politically yeah there's a way to do you think then you go and you make changes through the political system you do it at an simply on to people\nThroughout the rest of the country who your fellow Americans unless you're trying to send a signal to them that you watch them to cause violence and I think that that may very well be with Hillary Clinton is okay with\nI think that's what she's doing ... making the threat we will continue to be an civil until you give us power back\nWhich is such an outrageous kind of challenge to say so you're going to continue to cause trouble in major American cities around the country until we do view power\nBack she wants three the mob she couldn't get power legitimately ... last rent rent she's she's a perennial loser in politics and now she's decided that the way she's going to

has been upgraded to our is now a category four but even the the just the wind speeds have gone up in the last ah of the advisory\nJust we just received if in fact we're going to go over that right now with meteorologist Tom hale who joins us live a Tom or take a look at this ah for a central uh update here from the national Hurricane Center what's the first thing that had\nA first thing that hit me that it is down increased in maximum sustained wind speed two hundred and forty miles an hour wow wow that's not gosh you know\nThat's the sustained wind speeds or in the center of the storm to a hundred and forty miles an hour now ... this this cat for category\nGoes up to a hundred and fifty seven miles now a hundred and fifty six miles an hour after a hundred and fifty seven I I don't expect it to get to that point right okay butter at this point all bets are off I'm ... and it's now it's now increase speed by one mile an hour now that's kind of significant I said it was wobbling and I\nAnd as has started to pick up speed and as it gets closer upper air wins will start to turn it off in a north northeast direction and it will speed up and we'll see that and the next advisory but probably what caught my attention even more than that was what the Tallahassee weather service National Weather services just posted on their website okay\nIt says unprecedented event unfolding\nFrom the national weather service office in Tallahassee we search the history database for a category ... storm and landfall in the panhandle of the Big Bend area and the map and they show this map it's got just a giant white circle around it is blank is never happened before\nAnd so then they put their advice this is your all words you know screaming in text Las T chance to get to a safe place and\nGet there in time and the storm will bring deadly surge and to the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend coast and this is not comparable to\nAnything you've ever seen before and so if you've been told to evacuate leave don't say\nDon't risk the life of your family\nRight right uh uh Tom does this increased the possibility of the storm surge when you increase since we've been on the air it's gone from a hundred and twenty five miles an hour to a hundred and forty does that increase the storm surge ...\nThe instability in fact the\nCalls for instability coming from\nHillary Clinton Cory Booker Maxine Waters and I don't know anyone on the left who's saying we cannot call from the for this and that we must stop this in fact\nAnd that would be a I don't care who it is a Chuck Schumer or anyone else they're not stepping up and saying we need to end this I notice is enough enough is enough\nAnd Val ... and that that's why I wanted to bring it up here because as you mentioned Hillary Clinton she piled on again yesterday in a CNN interview here as part of that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's been civility can start again\nSo we're not going to be civil until we get our way in fact the instability right now if you look at the uh the level of it it is about them not getting their way they're not winning\nAnd and we said this I don't know there was a couple of months ago and we said All right imagine that that there's not a blue wave imagined that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nNow the polls are you know all over the place and we're not making predictions were just saying for the sake of the conversation imagined that happens\nYou know how insane it's going to be imagined that Trump wins again and twenty twenty [noise] there there's no sign of letting up in fact what you just heard by their a former candidate for president of the United states is we will not be civil\nOr and look the I I a\nCompliment her for being honest [laughter] well ... how can I agree to disagree around it [laughter]\n\nEven on that why you got me on that you see a ... I\nI guess my point is they really think this is going to work and they really believe that the ... if you're a Democrat you really believe\nThat by intimidating and in in a a mob rule because you won't do it individually but I don't do that you won't you won't do it individually in a place where there aren't TV cameras right you're not going to confront anybody you only do it when you've got a group of people behind you and you find a singular source there when you get when you have\nWhen you've got the crowd power over someone\nWhich again is cowardice in in in in my book\nAnd when we saw you know the whole Ted Cruz thing and CNN was talking about the whole mob thinks well it's not ... it's not as if they were discussing what what the definition of mob is and but the fact is we know what they're we know what they're trying to do when they're being much more clear about what\nThey're trying to do my point is I think we're going to win over the American people are that they think they're going to intimidate conservatives or Republicans on this I'm Sorry a failed policy is just not it's not going to work it's a wrong policy by the factors are doing this why because they can't

and\nI could not sustain that they've set up these shelters and if you cannot get out of the way the storm maybe you can get to the shelter but a heed the warnings if at all possible because this will be a deadly ... as we've been uh\nTold here since a mutt a hurricane Michael is hit a hundred and forty mile an hour winds now and it's well into a category for right that well built structures\nBe destroyed if they can offer on the truck drivers we want to remind you that of course I ten right there it in the entire panhandle of Florida are is going to be affected by this and how much of it\nAnd uh I share this at the top of the hour and I can't resist sharing it again [noise] um the national weather service uh Tallahassee now mind you\nThese are the professionals who are sitting here taking in all the data yeah\nAnd they are responsible for the safety of the people who are with in their coverage area in Tallahassee and and that covers the panhandle and the big band and so they put this little thing together and if you want to see it you can just Google\nTom hale news twelve just Tom male news to Google that I posted it on my Facebook page and I invite you to share it\nYou can share it with any of your friends in Florida you can share with anyone you know somebody who might be in Florida because they need to hear this message the banner heading says unprecedented event unfolding\nAnd then it goes on to validate that by saying that we search the database for category for storm\nAnd to make landfall in the panhandle in big band and this is what our map showed a blank it's never happened before so this is your last in bold letters chance to get to a safe place and the time for that is closing\nAnd so within the next five or six hours if not already you may be in an area where the water is started to rise up and you may not be able to get out of there [noise] okay that time is closing and so they the weather service because they've never seen anything like this before long coastline\nUh they're bleeding and saying if you have been told to evacuate leave and don't stay and don't risk the life your life or the life or your family\nAnd you also have to include the thought that if you are in a situation and it becomes an emergency if you can't get out of there that means first responders can get to you\nThat's exactly right and and they've heard that message on their local television stations or radio stations and everything else but the reason people choose not to leave is because\nThey go back to their own experiences and their own personal bias is limited ... yeah ... and it's really that simple\nWhen you know nobody that let's put it this way the vast majority of people who live there and we'll say nobody but the vast majority of people that live there have never seen anything like this unless somebody might have gone through hurricane Camille welding\nAnd you mentioned bill when you mentioned you know the nearby air force bases and military personnel and you know I mean just any transient population maybe some tourists that are there people that just haven't lived there and as as that or even if you have\nFor a long time if this is an unprecedented event that means very few people relatively speaking have been through this if any in that area have lived through this kind\nOf storm in ... those those damaging wins the water and everything else that becomes a threat very quick\nYes and and and it means that the people who are in charge of predicting that are now in a situation where all bets are off ... ... yeah it is that ... you know I mean\nWe make for addiction and and and you normally say this about us whether guys well better they get it right fifty percent of the time and they still get to keep their job well maybe we're better than that but it doesn't matter because in this case\nThis is what we're guessing it it give us fifty percent of the time and if we're wrong by fifty percent than [noise] forget it right\nExactly and and and that's\nAgain you look at as to what you mentioned earlier it bears repeating here in in a well built structure a well built home new construction up to code and beyond this these high winds can rip a ... roof off and will do so in a half\nA second yeah and and that debris goes flying again you know into a interest neighborhood and goes into your neighbors structure\nAnd we're we're talking about danger from several different elements of this storm and in this segment we haven't even talked about the uh any given possibility and the potential at any moment for a a tornado or out of\nIt but this is just one big tornado rhyming winds up to a hundred and forty miles an hour and we've just got a big torn\nRight right well let me ask you this because you know since we've been on the air it ... it was a hundred and twenty five an outside for a hundred and forty as it gets closer to the shoreline and I asked you this after each and every a new update ... is there a possibility that it could even get stronger\nYes yeah gas because we're we're talking about a hundred and forty miles offshore and\nIn this first hand of three or four weeks ago I went down to Pensacola and I I spend a couple of hours floating in the eighty five degree water ... okay and so\nThis water is just prime the atmosphere the air is moist and humid and it's a rich deep moisture that stretches\nWell up into the mid level of the steering currents and the latest beat her olive just discussion that we read and breakdown shows that the serious layer above the storm has become more centric and has become more organized into the flow\nOf the jet stream that's carrying it away now if you've got a vacuum cleaner and it goes into a container that you can't evacuate the your your plug the blowout mhm\nThen that vacuum cleaner eventually stops working but in this case the what we're saying here is\nThe outflow of warm air evacuating out of the top of this storm what we would call a thunderstorm anvil okay is well\nOrganized and attached to the jet stream flow with mid levels and so it's a vacuum waiting all this warm moist air which creates an increase in the flow at the bottom of the storm\n... as we wrap up this segment and we thank you throughout the show you've been with us and we expect to be able to talk to you or tomorrow and go over and maybe we will be looking at a you know the again all the conditions inland and and what to expect further\nBut uh give us a rundown on the timeline for Michael er when I get the shore\nAll the way you know going into back into the Atlantic what what should we expect to in the coming hours and days\nOkay a first Michael is going to be coming ashore it'll be just offshore and about eight o'clock in the morning or I Can't tell the exact distance because of the predicted speed is going to change and it'll increase heading into shore [noise]\nBut let's say it gets the shore in about three o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon from there\nTwenty four hours later\nI'm Michael is going to be passing underneath ... or between Valdosta\nAnd making a in Georgia or from their um by the time we make it to tomorrow night it will be crossing the Georgia Carolina line\nAnd it will be moving its way in between savannah and Austin or August I'm Sorry and or at and and so it'll be basically following I Ninety five\nAnd it will be just or maybe twenty five or thirty miles inland divine Ninety five probably crossover Florence and Fayetteville as it heads up the coast I expected to get off the coast somewhere\nIn the Carolinas or the edge of Virginia and then stay off coast by the time we find it friday night it's going to be offshore\nAnd it will probably be offshore\nOf um of Boston ...

I Know I guess really yeah\nNow I get that the good thing ... that he didn't right or wrong but he didn't answer the question um\nI find that kind of odd\nAnd and then we have a third cooperating witness down road ... and ... that they were then with Kelly and the other two were in Vietnam I mean yeah they all say that it would have been to wear a wire and and the president\nOn dry ... yeah that was that none\nOf them today rather than they were both here or the committee to this year it let it and he now are refusing to appear because he doesn't want to cut right on the road\nKnow what I I [noise] ... when when when that whole thing popped up a couple of weeks ago by well you know it was Rosenstein going to be fired\nYou know what I I ... when when when that whole thing popped up a couple of weeks ago about well you know was Rosenstein going to be fired as the president going to fire him personally my personal thought is that they were trying to bait Trump into doing that and I thought that\nThis whole thing about wearing a wire it's and I could be wrong about this but my thought was they were trying to ... because\nWhat did we hear from a lot of people that can't stand the president all if he fires Rosenstein Rosenstein it's over that since he was he a good again impeach my gut feeling is that was a trap and the president didn't take it well again or\nThey're trying to trap them all the time I Would think yeah unbelievable yeah\nOK but my ... my ... my aunt was wrong he wrote a letter recommended comb fire okay for the president or what it does and then he turned around and put the prosecutor on him for Dr ... [noise]\nWell I look at what you've got to understand ... what you've got to understand and when I'm when you called uh before I mean you're never going to stop this as long as Donald Trump is President Trump never go to ... yeah so that them do what they want to do they're not going to get rid of him\nAnd I I I look at their public servant they're not all that good for an elected official I don't understand how they can get away with refusing ...\nYeah I understand that Norman thank you for the call my friend we got to run but I think to Norman's point Brad people are they're frustrated because\nUm you know one faint listen whether the president's correct or wrong on things or however this Russia thing shakes out in the end whether there's nothing there's something there is something in between you know Brad\nI think that this whole scenario now with James Komen Christopher Wray and Rod Rosenstein and everything is for nothing else spread its really sheds light now\nOn may be to the common person who wasn't interested in how the FBI works and what the relationships are\nAnd the president no matter who mayonnaise may not have\nTotal power to get the FBI you know we ... that the store and how many years is a story how many years Brad did we hear for decades that you know and then he grew up in a little more of this and I did how many years did we hear the most powerful man in America was she had gr Hoover\nYoga and all those are you kidding me because of it was it because of everything he had on everybody right I Will you know ... and he had all the whole gang Martin Luther king the eye of the Kennedy Henri everything you know so this is not this is not the first time we've heard this let's go to Ted in Hartford had good morning good

know eat meat sold on ... an elder statesman\nI think his confirmation hearings would be interesting because I I'm going to be wondering if anybody in the Democratic party is going to go after\nLet me what are they going to go after him on and how would they go after him on there because I Believe there would be confirmation hearings for those of you know I I was there always are I might be wrong but I think so no there are now\nSo but uh no Joe a job would be as it does is just my opinion yeah I Would be a a a tremendous\nPerson in the in the United nations and the other the other person they're they're a they're a ... is this woman Dina Powell\nWho has been a corporate bankers she's also worked for the state department in fact she was I Believe Dina Powell was had a high ranking posed at the beginning of the Trump White house decided to leave and and and take a job with a bag or something and now\nIs being reconsidered so you're going to hear the name Dina Powell being tossed around to you know for this so well but they're going to be interesting I should go to the you know what I Would love to go to the un\n... ... ... what could you see me as a bastion that'd be great because I see what a good job I\nCan you imagine me addressing having a problem with my right ear 'cause you could you imagine me addressing are you from may ... they're shut up and there\nAnd the state has had this inflated discount rate of uh over eight percent which is totally unrealistic George Mason looks at that\nAnd basically says look at your official unfunded liability this is as of ... the end of twenty sixteen so it's a little over a year about a year and a half ago if fish will unfunded pension liability was thirty five point four billion dollars but if you do it using a realistic discount rate I Hope you're sitting down\nA hundred and Twenty one point five billion\nWhile while I mean it's\nIt's not like ten percent more it's like almost three hundred percent more a little ...\nYou know we're we're looking at I saw you see the same estimates I Do being in the legislature I mean obviously you know ... we're already seeing that whomever wins the governor's race you know whether it's a scream all whether it's ... whether it's\n... they're going to be looking Len two years out and yet where we heard this before another situation where we're going to be two two and a half\nBillion dollars in the whole well you can't get rid of any state employees 'cause there's no layoff clause would see back so what happens then what happens there I\nWell that's what I've been saying now for the better part of the year the feedback deal is unsustainable it's not worth the paper it's printed on it's impossible for this they are given its current\nFinancial condition to be able to meet its obligations under that agreement and that's no I'm not I'm not disparaging state employees at all I'm just saying the agreement itself is completely unrealistic an unfulfilled will by the state and the sooner\nOr that that's recognize the more we can get down to the business of\nDoing a deal that is realistic one that the state can be in one that the state of boys themselves can rely on in terms of their security and they're a retirement benefits but right now\nUh as long as they're not willing to come to the table again it's it's a it's it's an impossible situation you set up for\nA week tactically we can't lay off one single state employee for another two and a half years and yet we're the deficit that forecast for the next by any him as four point five billion dollars\nSenator senator if I Want to ask\nYou is just something very\nVery simple here\nOkay these are all elected officials all of you we've got the unions\nOkay they are certainly in control and you mean to tell me\nThat the elected officials Democrats and Republicans cannot sit down and say look we cannot afford it anymore and you got to do something\nOr we're going to do something I mean why why can't this be talked about we do the same thing every year I talk with you last year about the same thing mhm mhm ...\nBrat I think whoever is the next governor the very first thing they should do is declare\n...\nBread I think whoever is the next governor the very first thing they should do\nIs declare a state of financial emergency for the state of Connecticut they should make it very clear to everyone in the state that we're in\nDire financial circumstances and and that will set the table for people being more realistic about the the state obligations to their state employees and and I know and I\nLook at some of the state employees I I Know very well I've got a few that live actually right in my neighborhood I've got a number of people I interact with all the time or their staff and they helped me out\nAnd and I've had the privilege of working with a lot of hard working state employees so I'm again I'm not disparaging them but the deal that Governor mulloy worked out was totally insane I mean he's tighter hands on the benefits portion for ten\nYears not two or three or four years and again they got it there's no layoff for vision and you know another thing that stands out in the George Mason study as we all talked about the pension liabilities and you know that kind of a thing or there's something called other post employment benefits as pretty much the healthcare stuff and all that\nAnd that's almost twenty two million dollars and you know how much we funded towards that one percent one ... the only two billion dollars it's we're in ... an incredibly devastating\nA attack catastrophic condition and it's got to be recognized\nWhen I was leaving a chamber of commerce event yesterday one or a Democrat came over and said oh we can't talk to pessimistic and I said no but you got to be real is yeah yeah yeah you can't ignore reality and optimistic 'cause I Know this we will find a way out of the mess but it's going to it it\nIt it is a terrible mess you have to recognize\nYou have a problem to begin with before he can solve it if you're going to whistle about the graveyard and pretend that we don't have a a whopping unbelievable calamitous financial problem then you're not going to you're not going to solve everybody's problems so the first thing that a\nGubernatorial candidate should do a ... pronounce that they recognize how catastrophic their conditioners and they know all of them know that they have to go back to the state of boys and talk about resolving that situation because without doing that\nWe are in no man's land we can't solve anything\nAnd they're always great to have you uh uh weather's and leaves are set the tone the folks that listen to the two of us know what it is and our next step is we've got to do something about it not just\nTalk about it thanks so much for being with us today we'll talk to you so that anyone Brad and Paul ... thanks\nUnbelievable task well you know when you stop to think

don't think it takes ... scientists to see we need change you know\nUm I mean I've been a very active in my town in my district yeah uh for the past three or four years and a\nWhile before that but in politics yeah three or four years and uh to be honest it just came from you know my heart and my drive I just decided my mom was heavily involved in politics district so you grew up with it right you know I just turned into me saying All right I Want to do it\nInteresting so you grew up political talk was in your house with your mom and everybody else so Democrat while yet to okay so that's interesting so wait a minute Brad we have a guy running on the Republican Party ticket whose mother was a Democrat\nHotter than that at ... Democrat helped us level whose brother who had right one yeah [laughter] well she'll do several prominent figures in the in our in our district um and not even our district ... Joe Lieberman with his campaign as well um and\nYou know I don't necessarily agree with these people but a lot of them actually look up to old Joe Lieberman's a huge role model in mind you know and it it comes from his independent minded um and for me I I decided that when I was in high school I wanted to look more into politics and intrigued me and I are aligned more conservative values and democratic\nValues I think it does something Andrew what you did was tremendous and just what you have\nOne of the biggest complaints that I have had is that it's one sided\n... or the other folks they want to go their way\nBut nobody gets together but you had a couple of key things that you said that you are running for office and you want to do the very best in the area that you represent and that might be with working\nWith the opposite team to get through what they want and I think\nThat is something that is missing today I really do that I mean it really is I mean that's why you know we try we try to have conversations with both sides are trying to have conversation was anybody who wants to have a conversation and we're always open to all discussion we never have a concrete plan but we have ideas that we believe but uh we were always open to a discussion about it [noise]\nYou're a college senior year at Central and on most college campuses let's just say that they're not real warm and fuzzy and a Republican is\nBecause of course Republicans wanna kill old people after\nThey feed the dog food uh there and you know they want the country to be run by Vladimir ... and every Republican hates every woman walking so would that\nBeing said uh how some of your friends at Central look look at you and also I you know and Dr always thought there's there are a lot more conservatives are right leaning people on some college campuses and then people are aware of\nUm and there's a bunch I mean when you talk about ... out in the spotlight you're talking about in a classroom or you're talking about talking to a professor talking to other students that maybe I don't know yeah\nThat can sense that says if you say you're a conservative Republican gonna get you're going to get screamed [laughter] but ... don't be fooled I mean we have we have a presence on pretty much every single Cambodia and Connecticut with the college Republicans young Republican and there are a bunch of heavily\nInvolved of Republicans at least try to make a difference\nAnd you just said something Andrew ... that really frost me off look I'm In my late fifties and and and I was in high school in the seventies and went to college late seventies early eighties and I went to be you and and and we had\nWe had literal speakers we add communists we had far right speakers we had John birth society speakers but everybody came to campus we were respectful some we went to see some we didn't we didn't burn down buildings we didn't have\nThese oh we have to have a safe space because the guy like Ben Shapiro's here that's the thing I mean are you seeing that on campus where it really is he the it bothers me and I work at a college to an end and it really bothers me that there is no discussion anymore there's all this finger\nPointing and yelling and nobody wants to well why do you see what in your life made you feel that way here's how I feel\nThat right I mean and it still happens when we had when when you kind of had\nBench beer examine the executive here for college bubble when when the ... I was the end of the world yeah what what you got very upset that up it was bad I mean not just bad and the fact that people were complaining oh there are people who set that up like a death threat oh yeah yeah yeah they got that threats ringing someone to campus many of them got\nThat any of them and then I watch law and I watch a really ... I watch band somebody's Facebook Live band singing you obviously there it was great it was respectful he was funny he took questions from people who disagreed with them and everybody went home so hopefully guys like you and your generation can say let's just take a breath right now they don't want an open\nDialogue anymore I mean at the specific at least the people that I've seen in the universities there's somewhere open dialogue it this way and that's it yeah and it's sad because we need to have the conversation whether or not we're right there right we're we're not both wrong and we need to find a different answer fine but we need to talk\nAbout because the real young people the real college young people that started all this you know the the the Vietnam generation they were very passionate about what they did but if your research late sixties early mid seventies ran have\nSo they didn't burn things that they didn't they protest it but they were cerebral they understood there were ... you know there wasn't this physical threatening they understood what the issues were\nAnd my friend Andrew ... co state representative candidate yes twenty ninth\nDistrict and uh watch

nonsense them into the very clear that the president and his entire team had been working very closely with ...\nA Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it an appropriate time the president will go

morning they say\nI Know he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the friends the ah has gotten to a point Newt that and I was talking to folks say yesterday who were in Washington and in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy uh both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything in this angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate I think\nI think basically you had ... intensity up through Watergate you had a\nWe had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point a U.S soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports that are being harassed or the new is a very bitter very divisive time ah but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while\nAnd uh now we're drifting back\nBecause this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't in actors that shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like justice cabin on its because\nWe want to return to a constitutionally based court system that uses the American system as this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result\nIf your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately to change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously good or blow for the people who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... and Hillary Clinton who's gonna when\nThey go at the two justices you've got and he'll or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that will really been a very\nDramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you or Larry Sabato who of course famously bombed and his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this protection for the midterms\nThere has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had it and the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen\nIt's just a question of how big the blue wave is they can be sued ami it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nAh what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right\nBut it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just one hey you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic or and we won for the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years once his explanation\nOf how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee and Arizona's now ahead or how\nCome that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah Tennessee as people began to realize the British and actually\nThe Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you can get to a government run health system ... starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is gonna end up ... I'm I'm just getting a sense of you know so many other cells sabbatical and say\nUh where is the worst of the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races in and then some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum versus Ron I'm a scientist because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida\nA run by Rick Scott and\nAnd to the idea of turning that state over as critical as that status in the country electoral politics to a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is um [noise]\nThe latest great hope\nBecause he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrats uh he won an upset victory or eat the\nKey temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on for ... but when you say governorships remember as a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states are all Republican every single one of the ten\nHighest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna winner landslides and the reasons exactly why\nWe're building a majority in the country they get results\nThey don't just have resistance\nAre they actually up things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign\nThat drives home again and again and again\nThe difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that or not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work and I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nOr I think that's I I don't think people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or they might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I Would if I get that\nBut I think the this frenzy people want it all to come down they just want things to come down and they want to come down on both sides and I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it it gives people a bad feeling\nAnd I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible you'd have jobs being created yoga lowest\nBlack on employment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results and then you have as you point out\nUm people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George stores and others actually pay for them uh which doesn't you know does that justify I'm\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh advance before the midterm uh elections\nAnd there's one on October Fifteen or where you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and they'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up ah attending this do their own and\nAnd and let me let me just say also that we're\nWe're very excited that they they can go to an evening with Newt dotcom launched repeat that an evening with new dot com Lee he'll be when I was going to be

there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two\nNo three social media is just the opposite you know we we we it has taken power this is part of the reason why\nThe left are so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad chocolate itself let's face it\nThe New York times is sad joke CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time I watched any programming on any of those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks\nAre but I don't know anybody who does just that their power is draining away too you know the lower income show in the Fox news and two of you know Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and\n... so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite the repellent their marginal viewers the marginal readers marginal listeners and sending them sending them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and placid at a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a\nI think the pier calm and the storm don't you agree with that uh\nYeah I Will Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered our changeup ... but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than bronco bomb and certainly better than\nHillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can do to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it it stand is pretty well fish but it it's in he's in better shape than the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer I'm so many great Reagan books how Reagan dealt with them personally riots and will will play a bit of sound on those if you miss the show last night let's listen\nTo those people told you four days in advance that if the universities to my hand with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university\nAnd the many who she what she said what is your whole university is a public institution that is right in the universe its own community in the community in Berkeley the live around all of them\nBegan the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better ... young\nPeople think that they have the right to choose the law they would all day as long as they were doing in the name of social protest he gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about\nYou know there there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they left I Want to do a a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam or you know beat north Viet Cong soldier or something like that if she was completely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler thumb and the I've just average rent is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan your old friend Marty Anderson used to say the Ronald Reagan was he said warmly ruthless and if you listen to rag and he says these professors somebody if you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so\nYou know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact\nThat he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here ... which is that\nIf people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions can justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... ... it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that\nYou know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way\nThis idea that a over on CNN you can't use the word mob look up ... tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political upheaval but [laughter] but that's what they've been doing it for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're ... dressed in period garb\nYeah and that's why the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well the Tea Party at a protest and the liberals had a protest they must be one of the same note there no one on the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough right as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well\nIf you if you want to want to stand up for women in El ... then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nYeah but but that that maybe I've said this before in the Sean I beg your pardon of a hat but the difference today between a moderate conservative leader modern conserve politician than a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician\nGoes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it put a moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because the because liberals going to do with the good things for you a moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I may give it back to you ... have\nTo think about it you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration of that comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states and localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nA again power to power to the people the let me try to show up that slogan but they never really don't but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the Republican\n... power to the people stays with them not some with some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time\nNow this is Jeane Kirkpatrick I think it was it the Nineteen eighty four Republican convention center in Dallas yeah let's let's go\nHarry Truman said Congress\nBasic source of our spring we believe in the dignity of man why democratic presidents\nPre planning your cemetery needs is important to me to

[noise] I'm Dave Ramsey your host of this is your show numbers AAA eight to five five to too many years ago I discovered\nThat there are thirty one proper ...\nRead the book of wisdom in the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of which makes it fairly easy to read one a day so if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one problem\nThe easy to read one a day so if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day and if you do that over and over and over twelve times you will have read that book in one year right and I'm Thirty years later I have read it a bunch of times\nAnd I you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you actually understand the stuff you will get wiser isn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser your life gets\nBetter 'cause you go do stupid stuff you know I figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life I have you know it's fairly simple and you kind of get back what you put out\nYou ... what you do if you plant corn corn grows your plan stupid you grow broken desperate you know you're gonna get a crop up something in your life what your crop gonna look like right\nFor instance proverbs ... as a slack hand\nCauses poverty but the handle the diligence\nMakes rich translation\nLazy will make you pour and your work and you'll have money are sort of hard translation is it a slack hand causes poverty but the handle the diligent makes rich interesting diligent what does diligence diligence as excellence\nOvertime\nContinued excellence not one moment of excellence but continued excellence an ordinary things when you do ordinary things with the level of excellence that's called diligence and by the way that makes one\nRich [noise] interesting isn't it the hand of the diligent what's the hand hand of the Belgium makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now the observed it in all the millionaires we may with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study the Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires and one of the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read\nThat Dave Ramsey dot com [noise]\nWhen you're on and it was American dollars in San Francisco hard\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nThough I'm forty five and\nI'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay [laughter]\nI'm In for one K. and stuff like that but\nUm [noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid off some of my dad but um what's left is only about thirty four hundred but I'm sure I'll be on the path of Ninety Days or um [noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have\nPM I and I when I Do the math that like the six thousand dollars and closing the U.S versus a hundred and eighty seven\nMonth ends up being in three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do with the\nReal story in the home longer than three years is the only way you're gonna end up getting gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure\nSo um that's how your in laws and um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is\nMuch longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis are probably would not but if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point are making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a while I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah but where your interest rates go up and also that\nHe well he acts like a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting quoted about like for you know so you're not going to make any money so is it better just to stay in it and pay the\nThumb and you're gonna be able to say probably gonna be a four seven five on a Fifteen year old now a today and so that's like one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\nThis one is a hundred and sixty six thousand okay and so one and three years I've already paid off ten thousand or about\nOne percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase\nAnd so one in there at three years I've already paid off ten thousand now\nAbout one percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year okay and you're only saving Eighteen hunger or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah\nI'm okay everybody sickly breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\n[noise] and then I add one other question I just joined ... P U and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class jumping I still don't even go in\nYeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already ahead of the game on that you're you're missing an even go back and watch it on with your own line 'cause you got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year okay\nSo yeah you go and watch the lesson one and then when you go in Iraq with whoever zone listen to your right in sync okay you know troubles\nAre you doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine ... with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a a a a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity and has since moved to Boise how much but we um I'd say well that's\nHow much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom loving ...\nYeah um so we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build their by [laughter] um but I'm not quite sure um because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\n[laughter] are you out of debt that we get go yeah we don't have any debt good um but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah really what we want or do we\n... we wanted we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have oh God will put a small mortgage on it and paying off real fast okay the only thing I don't think I might well I mean what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty okay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\nOh preference between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty and the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah over two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right All right I'll bet you can play that all five years\nTrue yep no I mean does not know how old are you guys\nI'm I'm forty five and my husband's fifty things\nYou have any money in savings were investments to this not in a retirement I don't know if this is all kinds of it [laughter] All right well my rule of thumb is never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage\nAnd the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that right way and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred fifty\nThousand or more you're going to really fine house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a long house that's wonderful property and what\nWe're hoping more property than a big house\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you're writing from rights\nAnd so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge in Boise a compared to you know big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and\nYou know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words I'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later and that's how we would know because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just have the different mindset that the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast and like other people's rate a car loan like five years or something you know let's just put on there and how fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones at AAA eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you know better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um I was wondering if I should tell my car worth about Eighteen thousand and pay off my about four thousand dollars worth of debt and start my emergency fund my card paid off\n... what is your household income about thirty thousand a year\nAnd ... and start my emergency fund and like hard paid on\nWhat is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen thousand other guards issues is that what you have too much tied up happening is going down in value when you're how when your car or things with motors your wheels of any kind I added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our house and included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house and the car was\nPaid off got it okay and I got the car and so what is your um what is your\nIncome prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty pounds so you don't see ... ... you don't see this doubling them now okay why I haven't got school yet okay and I'm a single mother and fiber and yeah\nYou you need the money more than you need that car don't you yeah yeah I in the cars going down in value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your dad put your emergency for unemployed you can get you an inexpensive car\nThat you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range okay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars\nRight now in your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position\nBut as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything what wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's going down in value and when you have all that stuff out of the gather you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your in your own income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper and your case you're going to change your income by going to school and things are going to change later but for right now I'm with you yeah I Would show that cost this is the Dave Ramsey show\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThat says Tom value of money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so\nAh but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house\nI don't know is risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know\nWhen you factor interests because there is risk when you have mortgage and I was not a lot of risk 'cause you got the money in the bank today to pay it off by or an investment by it off but there is risk and so ah you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on a home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWhen I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before\nAnd those things are really hard to put on paper so what I figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I haven't actually comes in\nAnd I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up and your shoes I'd pay off your mortgage today and if ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they rammed she's crazy a year from now just get you into the mortgage\nNo I I I I completely agree I mean I I've been wanting to be that way is just a lot of money I'd go you know I just go I mean I had my bed saying just paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth\nI what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nWhat I'm trying to point out is is your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nGot it that's what I'm pointing out that makes sense completely yeah I ... you got this thanks for the call open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five\nTo your heart sure he's not really you guys your heart your heart's where you measure rich march telling me pay off my house my hands tell me how come at Memorial day is what is your money\nBut your heads missing some stuff it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this for the clash of MBAs speaking to them and\nA cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business there were all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money and uh I got a finance degree I was talking to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teachers to borrow money\nAnd so um you know it it's broke finance professor of like a shop teacher was missing fingers right people so think about this rise of it you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things so um\nBut as you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much I'm ruining the radio to walk through the whole thing but happens is is think about this\nHow many of you\nIf you had zero debt and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had\nForty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund would make different career decisions way too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I worked for and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily you might just have a different career\nYou might go in a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting you know and here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it\nThis idea that if you're ... you're ready to have the money no you make twice the money you make more money when you're doing something you're good at 'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself or moving because you love it you don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog

shelter or extend my stay like it's been a hard uh-huh but um where is home\nYeah I I parked by the ocean andme I don't know\n[noise] and\n\n\nThanks for being with us America this is the Dave Ramsey show so glad your hair\nAnd\nYou know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about some\nHope causes you to be able to move the needle\nCauses you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that's\nThe move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you give paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness when you think that the lies and the tunnel is the way out of your trap and then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right and and what's the difference in those two events are both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the light you're going to get out of you believe you run to the law you're going to get killed right I mean so that's hoping hopelessness\nAnd all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives and it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope and so\nWhen I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that in my ... and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing I swam a thousand dollars a year\nYou're going to be out of debt and a little over two years and you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it you see what I'm Talking about ... and once you can see it that's called hope\nI can see my way out one of the things is steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective\nPerspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you know I remember one\nTime one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was a very upset about\nThe world is coming to an ...\nAnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her [laughter] now why are we used to and they in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experience is that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right\nSo we have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThat then you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through the garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situations is one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold causes you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought\nTo I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more but he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it like coke go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go\nShovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time but as soon as you do that money comes from work is where it comes from\nAnd I can't get enough hours will then work someplace else work more work all the time\nBut but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does\nNow when we were going broke too little babies and why the houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves how we get out of it or your mind off and well you know you can't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt\nBut I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nOnly thing is just perspective as like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd\nDidn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd\nBecause she grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that\nAin't gonna Oregon [laughter] it's going to be awful and but because he thought everything was going to work out you know it all worked out a lot\nBecause I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these tracks in these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same way different as you use your perspective\nBecause I'm challenge and some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you know you're stuck in\nThis marriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money\nYou think you're stuck in that you're not stuck you're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the pages are males are going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not\nStuck so look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say\nOne of I got to do what's got to be true that is not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking\nBut he was having trouble emotionally buying it and I don't think I helped him I was kinda bother me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow\nIf you took my wallet away where everything had been through and I have no identity no I ... and you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long because I don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this\nThat I'll be out and I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how I Would say but I Would get there I push my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless but I couldn't breathe\nAnd I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is that is his vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it than than there is no\nYou know that it's hard to take action it\nIt's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza at the end the story so it's going to be All right you know it can be you can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic is not positive thinking and it's not easy [noise]\nAnd and it's one of the reason I re biographies of successful people\nIs it lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it\nAnd that that's what I'm you know that's where you are it's where I have been and am sometimes\nOr church did financial peace we went there once or twice oh wow yeah so just to keep involved you know I think the only thing was we if we listen to on

always live by a fire up when I was a police officer live by a five foot rural you can do whatever you want to say whatever you want within five feet on may ... ... ... five foot rule all bets are off you know have that\nAll right so let's say you're out with your wife in a restaurant in New York somewhere queens wherever you are and are somehow they know you're an ex cop and they want to harass you and that comes screaming you calling you names and you say good within five feet do what you want but now they get close to the table and start shouting at you and your wife and your wife gets scared what do you do\nOr that your immediate fear of life at that point I Do what I have to do and that's and that's with anybody anybody once you have the fear of life and can protect yourself and this is Susan all books you can protect yourself\nAnd do what you have to do to protect life\nMy my attorney will be on shortly and I have in my hands the California criminal jury instructions he gave me the jury instructions on the right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing\nHow broad our rights really are to a ... defend ourselves against these left wing thugs really amazing we have tremendous ability to defend ourselves and what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy that most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nAnd this ability to defend ourselves on what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy that most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nUnfortunately it's called Obama hypnotized the nation for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this is the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down burgers in Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because\nWe're going to kick you\nRight there he's already telling somebody to go and commit a crime kicking somebody believe it or not Michael is aggravated harassment [laughter] that is a misdemeanor he's already telling\nMe All right look I don't know what's going on and I want to stop the bad this before it gets worse I Want to stop the mass hysteria and I'm sending you a copy of the book God Bless you for being a surviving all those years in New York on the streets\nBut you know something my friend none of us are immune to what's coming Hillary holder at all want violence in this country we should avoid it at all costs but if it comes to your doorstep what do you do when I returned joined the Savage\nNation coal no eight by five four hundred seven eight by four hundred and seven to eight to salvage\nYou can use enough force to stop and you cannot you can't damage them um in any significant waved\nAt one of the man is over six the and the the attacker is twenty five years old you can watch enough ... tell me one enough forces\nWell he can use greater force the the older you get the ... the angry or the person is the more um cohorts around who\nMay oh great so old white guys now have the ability to defend themselves great\nOh yeah yeah I mean yeah yes\nNow what if you're in a car trying to retreat from the mob and they chase you out of the restaurant you're getting your car they surround you and start beating on your car with sticks they did in Oregon what can you do them\nI Believe that that's very close to a threat of deadly force because if they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use that can lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation\nAnd you know if I told you the anger motorcycle people you know we're angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody would go good you got the gangbangers now you've got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they quote protests are ...\nAre there any cases that you've tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a illustrative of our questioning\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's wife so the man knock knock guide on his butt\nAnd my client was and put on trial for documents the bully on his butt and the jury acquitted 'em and later on one of them went up to me and said you know he was technically guilty but we didn't care the guy got what is the only one I've done\nSo I Know are you saying that a person can defend themselves if they're if\nThey if you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger you know that's it it's it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do which\nIs what if the guy as I say is over sixty and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNow I think that people whose cars were seriously they take away the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against trying to stop it and they're swarming the car on that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force um was on the table\nBut we're not recommending deadly force on this radio show and I will I Will cautioned everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once you want to know that person for the rest of your life in other words do you want to be right as you want to be smart you can be rights and wind up in court for ten years\nOr you could be smart and ... and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're trained martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you are right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand down and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria and you're talking about this\nOh like the idea that you have to stand down and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria and you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks\nAnd the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism [noise] you know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person inside it at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets masked mimicking terror groups or ... of the past what what's gonna happen at some point people have to stand up\nThat's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow they just don't keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone\nMost police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by a left wing fanatics as you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing for example in Portland resort police officers sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he looked angry I bet his superiors instructed him to stand down unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks because the problem with that approach is that these attackers these rioters cut it anytime lose it and attack\nSomebody for somebody getting out of their car or in their car can lose their temper and we'll be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late preemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\n... for Dan ... what's the bottom line urine let's note Dan how or what you're in a restaurant\nAnd you're actually a guy who's very fair minded in politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business a flaw it's OK yeah you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways\nI also know that I Know that you come from a family of of heroes that I Know for a fact I can I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBoss so proud of his father who was in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches in Normandy to to um to um I think in Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle than you\nI yes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the bulge and died\nSo damn comes from fighters Dan does night not like to retreat when people threaten him\nI've seen them in action in the courts so Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I have my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiter sees us doing it and he checked his friends to come and harass us they come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening I Would pick up a knife and disguise it in my hand [laughter] end up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask them to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people in in the restaurant to join in and protect us including\nThey won't show no nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nProbably but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect me I'm not going to take any physical violence from somebody who's attacking may\nFall now you know why that as my attorney [noise] yes it is an African he brings in the afternoons when I like ... then brings a napkin to a knife fight\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nWell dead all I'm going to take a couple of calls because this is not a joke in question I have a number of people calling on this issue either way including defense attorneys are on this stuff actually can I grab this call right now while Dan is on the line is there a way to do that if you pull it up from a gym\nCan you pull up blind for out of ... and Reno go ahead and pull up line for for his life for please go ahead quickly\nFor getting [noise]\nWhat's going on here

that they're that they want as many illegal aliens here as they can get an order too\nSo you understand that most American taxpayers don't want any more illegal aliens here it's I don't know who do watch them here other than those who benefit from the who wants them here and I so I I wouldn't be so surprised by that\nYou're shocked at the Democratic party is the party of illegal aliens you

point in my in my career\nSo I'm not speaking to the point of view of jealousy I'm speaking to the point of view of something else something is wrong with this picture who is inviting the president to bring in a rap star who makes a disgrace\nOf the oval office this is a sacred office that is owned by the people Trump does not own that office he's merely an occupant of it\nHe has no right to bring the level of that office down to the guts are in my humble opinion now of course you'll disagree with me just to disagree with me\nBut this is part of the cultural degradation that I have been trying to talk about for twenty five years on the radio\nAnd everything I'm Talking about it for the point of view of jealousy or mistaken again I'm a best selling author I'm an extremely successful broadcaster my current book is doing extremely well thank you audience very much you want to thank you for making it happen or I Hope you get onto a policeman for free as a gift\nBut I've been in the oval office it was a big moment for me do you think I Would jump up and hug the president\nDo you think I Would think it was not a violation of a common sense decency a secret service rules to jump up and give the president the side hug like to use the guy who owns a body shop somewhere in Bay on the Jersey what are you thinking\nI'm surprised by the way that the secret service is so bad\nThat this could ... by the way they should not have been shouldn't happen\nNumber one but I Would wish that there was a secret service agent or would have prevented the rapper from grabbing the president for this I look at the president's face in the picture is extremely shocked he's horrified by the way that the guy got so close to them do you understand how dangerous this is what a per say oh I'm wrong look at the picture\nI grabbed a screen shot up without having to put a ...\nWrap it violates Secret Service protocols that's on Michael Savage dot com and if you think I'm wrong look at the president's face he shocked he shot the demand got him in a hug where he's got his left arm over the president's left shoulder he's got his right arm holding the president's right hand the president's really backwards from him\nAnd they're cutting us making the big ass of himself again smirking to the cameras using that President as a marketing tool you understand that\nWell if you don't understand them and help you try to understand that this was a public relations disaster and what is he going to get ... votes from it\nYou know on Monday I'm going to have a diamond in silk on the show again because then the movie is coming out\nI think very curious where they think about this\nBecause this goes way beyond the optics of the picture\nThis goes to a breakdown in our society and almost every level nobody seems to have any value is left no one seems to know what's right or wrong no one seems north knows the difference between north and south no one has any dignity wherever you're turning everything's breaking down from the top to bottom that's that's a that's my opinion\nThat's my opinion Rosie Rosie on line three you disagree with all had please you're on the air\nYes Hi I was calling in\nI have left can offend them feel fine to have to ask for the the fact that I see as a member of that community\nHe fired at me and I both I don't I don't think for so as a ... so it was a garbage man and they can be ah not really so it wants to a garbage man has a right to be in the oval office if\nPresident if I can find a lot of the what if the president invited a pornographer in there who had a big a big following the pornography\nPornographic websites are amongst the biggest websites and the country would it be right for the president to invite the head of a pornography website in\nYou know I I don't want to touch the west is nothing but a pornographer with an instrument\nFriendly if America than a five hour thanks\nFor agreeing with me I've been waiting for that are all my life none of ... you don't understand this was pushed down a by someone else in there who got it all wrong and I don't think the president's going to gain any votes from it I think he's gonna he's not going to lose any votes but he's going to have a lot of people walk away feeling sick\nBecause if we are defending him and defending American values aboard his language and culture or you could argue that rap music is part of American culture you we'll be right in saying that but I Would say it's in the wrong direction it's taking America in the wrong direction of culture\nAh and I don't care about race it all going to make it racial go ahead and make it whatever you want because that's all it's on your mind I Would say this if it was a a a person of any any any race and if he wanted to have some one of the arts in there with a large following there are other choices besides a rapper whose lyrics are disgusting\nDisgusting do you think that I'm Alone in my opinion maybe on the first and the only wants to say it today but I can guarantee you that I won't be the last look at the lyrics of this rapper I Can't even read them on the air I Need you I Want you come to me ecstasy\nEcstasy ecstasy ecstasy or ... ... ... ... ecstasy she pushes drugs he pushes group sex he pushes\nEverything you could imagine that we don't stand for that's the message you think belongs in the oval office I can read more lyrics if you want but I'm not going to do it on the air they're all disgusting lyrics\nAnd this is an example of the the the collapse of American civilization\nAnd by the way I felt the same way when his darling wife was in their last a few months ago another one zero nobody an uneducated piece of a waste of human DNA human DNA was brought into human DNA a waste of human DNA excuse me\nNothing but surgery a a surgical textbook in high heels was brought in and I'm supposed to sit here like a moron and say how wonderful they brought in the wife of the rap and now he brings in the rapper whose that's why not a pornographer bringing a pornographer after all as some of these sites are doing their enormous\nWhy does he just sink the guy from the desert who has a uh all of the ... the um how's the prostitution a desert that guy dentist whatever his name is after all he's running as Republicans wanted to have him in there and give them a hug aside hug\nWhat's that guy's name in with the with the uh the Brussels out there in the desert of Nevada said that he represents American culture to you could have him in you know why not\nHave a a brothel owner have a pornographer and they may bring in six votes each you never know but I Would think that having to have a guy who runs like one of the major porn sites would be very smart politically think of all the people addicted to pornography would vote for Trump after that\nMuch the same thinking as having this guy in there at least that's my opinion I'm running short a time I'll be back\nDuring the Savage

bread the dot com sponsored by both like in the group of America\nYes [laughter] I I mean he did have some valid things to say but it was absolutely topsy turvy and I've got some of the topsy turvy audio to play for you in just a second you know I'm [noise]\nThe thing that I Would\nNote is that I think the Kanye West situation with a visit to the White House probably could have had greater effect if it works\nThe the aftermath of Michael I like President Trump going to Erie, Pennsylvania last night for a rally and we told you all about this we told is the president was going to get a rational of you know what a for a media outlets and\nOf course uh it it happened on the on the cable lose affair last night on some of the channels\nAre criticizing the president had why yeah I don't want to come across a crosses criticizing the president but doesn't the optics you know going to a campaign style rally when you have all this devastation and Florida I was I I I I'm thinking of the timing\nI could've been a little better and I told you the president tweeted out that there were thousands of people that were are going to be disappointed if he didn't show up all this stuff happens and natural disasters happen and you're reschedule I just think that the ... by rescheduling and not doing a rally last night\nUh it takes it takes the ammunition away from the critics\nAnd that I think it would have been a well placed decision to to move the rally and then with comedy a while he has a lot of good points to make you know I mean will it get news coverage yes it's already getting on cable news coverage today or will it get nightly news coverage the air but for a real ah from\nA ... a\nFood to firmly seep in I guess is the way I Want to put it for for Kanye is one of his drive is in and try to reduce crime and murders and bring jobs back to America and talking about prison reform hung those points that they could have had much greater impact\nIf you just got a little bit away from the big national does a\nNational story of a natural disaster in Florida just a recommendation ah before I play some of the economy audio the update is in and now the death toll which was at to\nThe death toll now stands at five\nWhich I'm sure it's going to go up an addict Gadsden County Florida and W T XL they're reporting the Gadsden county sheriff's office has confirmed that for people have died\nDue to hurricane Michael and related incidents\nOr the sheriff's office in front of the two people died in Greensboro one died in ...\nAnd another died in Quincy in Florida they confirmed that a Greensburg man died after a tree fell on his home yesterday and we we had heard about that we had that on during the program\nAh they haven't really studied the details surrounding the depths of the other three people but what we had heard a we have the free that fell\nAnd there was also an eleven year old girl a was killed as well\nUh apparently a a a leg of a car for in a metal um support leg somehow became a torn apart and became a projectile\nSo are the numbers we're having now it's almost like five people are are confirmed that my biggest concern before and play the Kanye West audio with President Trump the are the biggest\nThe biggest concern I have is that the mayor of Mexico beach they've got hit the hardest said that by his account about two hundred eighty people decided to stay and ride it out\nAnd we just don't know the fate of all of those two hundred eighty people I'm just hoping that there's not a a massive climb in ah\nIn the death toll here so hopefully it will be kept to a minimum\nAnd on to the Kanye West audio and I'll play a few excerpts here are just you know kind of all over the road I've you know kind of like a little Trump rallies [laughter] actually in the oval office today with Kanye West and\nI've got a an extended kind of hero grams of phone calls phone calls rolling in eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets the on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine levine rural or this first clip here and I'll I'll starting to stop and interject\nA few of my thoughts are regarding what kind you said earlier today in the oval office\nYou know the science fair is half half our friends but his half hour away\nSo he's talking about the red make America great again\nHat and that caused a little bit of er stern a ruckus when he was on Saturday Night live a couple of weeks ago and then he went into a speech on Saturday Night live which which we did not air\nBecause they'd already cut away and you know they were all the closing credits and they'd already a finished the show a buddy he gave a little speech about Trump or really just to the audience inside a studio\nWith an eight eight eight or whatever it is where\nAnd there's a at thirty rock so that didn't get broadcast but everyone saw his make America great again hat and here he's talking about his friends or try to stop him from wearing\nThe heck oh the ... wants to wear the make America great again that that he has all the right to wear the hats and again he says a lot of things that make sense or even though I don't really care for Kanye West I never have\nAnd just because I like Trump's policies doesn't mean that I suddenly after my Kanye West because Kanye West a is kissing the president's bought a ... I'm I'm not I'm not going to suddenly like honey once I just I've never liked the guy I saw let's continue the audio but he does make sense on a number of these points here you know\nAnd mom separated I have a lot of mail energy in my home and also a marriage will ... you know a lot of allergies are on all that for all we do with family you're married into a time\nWhere you know talking about [noise] you know ... what\nHe said he loved Hillary I got a problem that gay worst ones [laughter]\nWhen they have had I was making you know the guy that he didn't get to see my ... all the time by\nSacrifice was\nSo very talking about uh the um with her campaign and that didn't resonate with him because he's a guy and\nIt was a lot of his house and made me feel like Superman\nThat had the make America great again hat in the magazine that make them feel like Superman\nWho made a Superman that was my favorite superhero [noise] and you may have some ... case for me also at the guy that looks up so you look ...

half days\nAre on the heart Tampa stations is folks just over a year ago it was early September September one tenth eleventh hour last year\nAnd we thought the Tampa Bay was about to get wiped out my

the president if he's been very very active now the\nThe the rally last night in Pennsylvania and again\nYou know the president criticized Obama for campaigning after Hurricane Sandy back in twenty twelve so Trump's tweet criticizing Obama\nAnd you know damn well to Trump's going to get criticism for holding essentially a rally in Pennsylvania last night and from an optics standpoint or maybe should delayed it a day or two or whatever to not give the critics the ammunition or so he did that then\nI'm flipping through the channels last night watching a rare late night cable TV 'cause I\nI don't I don't watch the news channels at night I don't watch a live Tucker Carlson the Hannity's the uh the\nUh the Megan ... what's her name um uh well Megan Kelly used to be on Fox but I'm a you know the MSNBC\nOr you know I Want to face I'm drawing a blank here\nYou know they they can always look alike what what's [laughter] so help me thank you I I draw a blank you know Rachel Maddow our Lawrence O'Donnell I don't I don't I don't Cuomo's on CNN you've got\nOf a dime a limb and you know I I don't I don't watch those shows I mean don't last they I'm an opinionated I my own opinions and the last thing I Want to do after I prepped all day and and\nDone my radio show I don't want to go watch more of you know that just the stuff from the day being recycled I don't need to see the talking heads on TV so I don't want when there's a big news event like our\nAgain yeah I'm watching I Want to see the aftermath I Want to see the latest footage and they'll they'll so I'm watching\nLast night so Trump didn't rally and Betty ... calls in\nAnd and does this long interview with a was a Gretchen Carlson not included a shadow and Bream I confused I'm Gretchen calls the left and she has the legal issues\nAnd she has a nice little payout but Shannon Bream Trump has this law is on the phone was shot and bring them this morning the president holes in the Fox and friends and I think\nI think that I heard that he was on Fox and friends for like forty seven minutes\n\nThat's a tell you what [laughter] that's a lot of air time anyway so a President Trump was asked about being president and was it worth it and the president comes up with a dollar figure on what he claims it's cost him to be the president of the United states\nWell it's certainly a you know I'll tell you what I meant it would cost me you know I see these people say oh Trump gets rich being president outlet who I've lost billions of dollars since Cosby many as I said to my friend is a very wealthy friend said you know\nHow much it costs me two or three million dollars and it's worth every penny of it I don't need the money and it's worth every penny because I'm doing so much for the country I mean what I've done in terms of costs what I've done in terms of the military we're rebuilding the military very shortly we're going to have the strongest military we ever had [noise]\nYes it is nasty is ...\nIncredible the false reporting is so incredible\nBut I couple of things that first of all I don't know if he's lost two to three billion because his net worth according to Forbes is only in the high twos to maybe three billion to begin with\nA lot I\nI Will give up a lot of credit and I do because he has done a lot and there's been a lot of positive ah activity and action from this president which he promised during his campaign and a lot of it's come to fruition\nAnd he's doing a amazing thing you know my number one reason for voting for Trump was securing the United States Supreme court going forward\nAnd as far as I'm concerned my major reason for voting for Trump has been fulfilled with two Supreme Court seats now\nIn the Gorsuch and of course the embattled crazy confirmation process and and the attempts of absolute democratic destruction of Brett Kavanaugh uh as far as I'm concerned that the reason why I voted for Trump has been accomplished\nWith now are affirming of the Supreme Court this go this was the most important thing to me now as far as the military and rebuilding the military that is a equally as important now may only important to me and\nI I\nI Am concerned about the military or ... or degradation over the years we've talked about it extensively on this program\nAnd I wish Trump all the power to rebuild and make the military for his folks things are not getting easier things are getting a lot tougher out there and that's why I laugh I mean it's it's ... it is asinine when you hear well why do we need a strong military why are we spending so much over here like shut this down really\nAnd I've been I've been predicting this and I've been telling my audience this for years that we have massive problems on the horizon with the Chinese number one and Russian number two\nAnd I've been touting this since uh nine eleven I've been talking about this and guess what everything that I predicted everything that I've believed is coming through so Trump rebuilding the military\nIs absolutely essential however on the downside or deficits are growing greater and greater our national debt is is out of control so we we've got to figure this out as well you have multiple schools of thought there are some areas are saying listen I it doesn't matter whether it's not", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Torrington",
