caravan which I I agree with Trump ought to be stopped a holes in the political gift and you know I since ... brought up a very similar falling on this program previously that\nYou know this migrant caravan with this uh you know we're coming into the U.S come hell or high water I got to believe that this is a turn off as well too many independent voters and some democratic voters so the migrant caravan\nOr has been described as a gift a Republican gift going into the midterms and that is you know it represents a a case study on\nMany Democrats are ill in office or those that are aspiring one open borders and I I kind of believe that sensibility rises to the service here\nAnd even those that don't like Trump understand that you should allow of a migrant illegal alien caravan of seven thousand five hundred people or whatever it is now to just bust into the country a were coming in like it or not\nNo no you're not coming in and they should be stopped so there was I was laughing is are\nYou going to a former Trump campaign manager\nOr a\nYou got\nBen Carson and Barry vetted vetted called the caravan of political gift in terms of a motivator a motivator for conservative voters and I brought that up as well but also I think you're dependent on some Democrats as well and one point\nHe seemed\nWish that the migrants were all carrying drugs so the fear generation would go up even more I mean that's certainly some hyperbole which I wouldn't necessarily subscribe to he said I Wish they were carrying heroin I Wish we had thought of it\nIt speaks to the dearth of our creativity unfortunately that it said there were seven thousand people marching toward the U.S border one party wants to let them in the other party wants to keep them out [noise] and I said I don't care what part of your end\nAgain the man that you know people say oh you've got to let us in my ... not the voyage of the damned is not a folks fleeing persecution from not seen let me come on\nWell

President Trump's former attorneys are saying it's not a witch hunt\nSo you have to remember our Ty Cobb yeah Ty Cobb who served as Trump's internal you know White House legal team lawyer or he served

ISIS in Iraq and Syria out of over ten thousand minutes of evening news coverage that his point three three percent it is a positive story but the media are choosing to focus on other things where they can be negative\nIs there anybody you can sort of called them out on this because rich when I was a you know before he became a talk show host I was a reporter\nAnd you always look to the to best the competition that is that the competition told a story you at least told the same story and tried to get them one be further down the road in a story and and you always tried to find a story that nobody else was telling you is there anybody in the fake stream media that's willing to break from the pack\nAnd say you guys aren't telling the story but it's a great story and and then contrast it back\nTo some of the comments of bomb I still remember when he sat down for an interview with somebody from ABC News and he was explaining very carefully why it was so hard to hit ISIS where they lived in rock or because it was tough to to get to the target and you know as you explained all the difficulties and about three days later\nThe French for goodness sake went in and bomb the daylights out of Raqqa\nAnd remember running the soundbite able bomber explaining how hard it was to get to them and say\nYou know when the French military God Bless them can out do the United states or what the United States president things is capable it really doesn't say good things about your about your capabilities does it\nRight and that's exactly right and I would say one of the it's got extremely little grudging coverage but one of the big differences is President Trump\nChose a policy early on where he decentralized the authority to their commanders in the field you decide what to bomb we're not going to strangle it up and washing the way it was during the Obama administration and that\nHas helped the or the generals in the field get the success that they have that was you know there was there's been a couple of stories at the very end of twenty Seventeen a listing this is one of the bright spots Hans Nichols did a story for NBC but it it really has been\nPushed out of the headlines you know the war is I mean that the Trump part of it is about thirty three minutes the entire a war against ... against ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing\nThe whole state of it a hundred and fifty seven minutes of evening news coverage in almost two years this is a\nThis is a very very small percentage of the news coverage they're acting as this thing\nIs is a big story you you you were talking about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen this was seen as a major problem for the Obama administration now that it's not a problem of thanks to a in part President Trump and his leadership and his administration they don't want to talk about it I think you know if they're going to be unfair to the guy in badger\nHim over things they should at least be fair at some times and and cover the things that are going up pretty well the the record is better than people generally know that it is\nWell and I guess let me make this comparison when Katrina happen\nAnd it was seen as a as a big you know food bar for the Bush administration uh and and the media seemed to love to go back and do follow up stories and say well remember when Katrina was handled so badly will here's how they're doing now\nI understand that most news is about things that do happen and then it's harder to cover the house the didn't burn down or the bad thing that didn't happen so they could say well now that ISIS isn't doing as much we're not covering things they're not doing but to some extent what they're not doing is the story\nBut if you wanted to do a story you could go to those regions and say this was a region that used to be dominated by\nISIS with all the bad effects that would have on the local populations and everything else and this is what's going on there now because\nThe Trump Administration has pulled off what Brock Obama had declared to be impossible just a couple of years before and that story is completely doable and it's\nActually a very good story and the and the media does love to do sort of the good news stories you know you set up a new program to make this happen and look it's happening and you do the happy story that did whatever it was you intend to the program and then you have the alternative programs that were set up to do some good and they didn't do any good but they spend a lot of money\nThe story that did whatever it was you intend to the program and then you have the alternative programs that were set up to do some good and they didn't do any good but they spend a lot of money and you do that story as well they could do any of those stories right now but I think they're making editorial choices not to because they don't want to make Trump look good\nI think you're right I think I mean CBS has done is put a little more resources into this and the other two than NBC or ABC and I believe they had their correspondence walking in the city of Raqqa in Syria which was the headquarters of ISIS or they can go there now and walk around and talk to the people who live there to this regime I mean that\nIs a very compelling story we got a little little sliver of it uh\nBut you know given the importance of was to to ah the United states you'd think we'd be hearing a lot more about it not a lot less\nI Would think so too are there other good examples you run into where the mainstream media is avoiding telling me good store I just heard today that we're looking to maybe finish out the fourth quarter of this you're economically at four percent GDP\nAnd yet I have yet to see a mainstream news organization New York times or Washington Post the New York times and it pays the salary of Paul Krugman who had declared that anything passed a two percent growth rate simply was not possible and now we may finish out this year with the fourth quarter and the four percent range\nAnd I would think good any reporter worth his or her sold would say this was declared impossible a couple of years ago and now it's now it's happening but again that would require the old grey lady the New York times to actually say Trump is pulled off the impossible which I think they're getting tired of writing these days\nYou know there's been incredibly little coverage of that as well I mean looking at you know the tax cuts in particular are given a\nLot of coverage and negative courage when they were being debated well right if they took effect you saw those companies giving a big bonuses to people you saw you've seen companies with higher growth that led to a not thought today or other or in the last couple of days but big gains on Wall street\nA A N is led to that economic boom so has um\nThe deregulation campaign those have gotten just a a few minutes of coverage in this vast sea of of negative news this year ah it was one of the unsung success stories that I think needs to be told take\nRich last thirty seconds what's gonna happen when this caravan reaches the border which I think they'll do before election day how are they going to ... how are they going to cast this one depending on what happens when those those ah you know illegal aliens is what they are getting to the border\nWell they're already you know you've got I think every network now has people embedded in this caravan paint painting it is extremely sympathetically\nTo putting us in a position where we are going to have to cut you off but when you talk about freezing bank account who's bank account would you like to freeze and what would be your legal\nOr what's the legal reason because you know you got a bank account I've got a bank account the government can't come in and freeze your bank account without some legal authority and I know a lot of a suspect that there is money that is flowing to this group through a bunch of cut outs\nThat are probably so thorough I told one of my producers he said well how could that happen I said well let's say George Soros who a lot of us suspect so he's got the tides foundation a private nonprofit foundation\nHe'd tell somebody at the ... foundation has already sent money to say some do good or groups in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Mexico and what what do they do with it day by soccer balls for kids and they buy meals for poor people whatever they do with that they've got money that's already in Mexico\nAnd so one of those groups is gets the word go and take some of the money out and help fund is caravan\nHow do you stop that most of it is likely happening not inside our borders and not in banks that we have anything to do it so how it's easy to say shut them down to freeze the accounts\nBut what mechanism do you use to tell a private nonprofit non governmental organization an NGO in Mexico that has money to help the poor that they can't take money out of their bank account and go down and buy meals for some of the seven thousand\nAmerican companies that are affiliated out of their horns that yeah isn't any other\nOn your head in order to forward would reasonably say what the heck does our plant making wiring harnesses for Ford escapes have to do or whatever it is they're making down there what does that have to do this ...\nIt's kind of our economy\nOr is it is no no no no no because once you're talking about is your lashing out and saying well let's just heard some American ...\nWe are as it is our no\nNo no no no because once you're talking about is your lashing out and saying well let's just heard some American companies and say you could stop the how was Ford Motor company supposed to stop the caravan\nOf ... that's got to be in the car industry the money that they're gonna lose business they're going to lose it works actually\nYou're just going to you're going to point of financial gun at anybody's had who's within sight or connected to America and you're going to say where make this happen or else well the Mexican government can say Ford Motor company can't tell us what to do the Mexican authorities have\nThe power to do something about this caravan they could simply say we're not going to allow this big group of people to do this but I don't see how you start then lashing out at every American Company saying you're down there so therefore you're part of the problem\nThat we ... hours that's all it could last for days four days or so finally woke up they realize that we're serious the old shut down the last three or four or five days\nI felt like I think the president's threat to Mexico is serious\nAnd I think he'll probably ... through Twitter ers were public public announcements before then but when you just say start attacking American companies that do business in Mexico it'd be like telling companies that do business you know some other foreign company like Germany Germany does something we don't like the\nSale of us are shooting civilians at all I Know it wasn't gonna on oh\nNo I'll tell you what the US government and the military is very good at guarding borders we guard borders as we pointed out last night in Afghanistan we've guarded borders in Iraq\nWe've ... and I think that the United states military is very good at guarding borders\nThey're very good at concertina wire and as far as I'm concerned put a bunch of that on the border and beef up customs and border protection the border patrol and say to them look nobody's coming across this line and to to some extent we're in a good spot now because if they try to come across in one big massive group\nThere'll be a lot easier to deal with what I Wonder is as they get close to the border\nAre they going to start to spread out I mean if they're one big giant caravan\nYou can probably stop that from coming across the border but if they split up and they started heading for fifty different spots on the U.S border the parts that don't have wall and don't have a lot of patrols it's gonna be coming very difficult to do that bled over I'm not disagreeing that we need to do something I'm just suggesting that\nThose things like ... attacking American companies that do business in Mexico who can reasonably say we have nothing to do with this let's go to Stan Stan welcome to Lars Larson show\nHey Laurie thanks for having me but uh [noise] so um I think both of you guys are wanting to have leverage against Mexico to kind of forced the hand here I think we

refugee or asylum status that's not just people saying I'd like a better job in a better rate of pay that's not going to justify status on the border isn't\nJust exactly right so this is this comes back to the issue of the core issue here and that is right now we've got a problem in our asylum\nProcess are sound system and we've got imposing our laws as you point out especially with children that's making it really difficult for us to enforce our laws um right now you've seen a spike in families at the border since the end of the zero tolerance policy at it's been like a Seventy five percent increase that's like a couple of months yup\nAnd so now everyone knows\nIf you want to get into the United states bringing a child as you point out does he have to be your child just bring a child through and as long as you can hold that Keith together\nFor a little while that Sharif together for a little while you get three right now and on our and our immigration courts are burst needs to seems and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough um that's something that Congress needs to change\nWell is there a way to stop this group before they hit American soil because I Know that a lot of people don't appreciate does but if you get your feet on American soil then you're entitled to full constitutional rights if you're stopped short of the border then you don't have any constitutional rights whatsoever so\nBut is there a way to do that the president has threatened to use the military to stop this but it does the military set up two feet south of the Mexican border or three feet north of the Mexican border\nYeah see that's the problem I think the reality is that if you try to use the military first of all there's limitations on what you can even use the military for we have certain laws that prohibit the military from engaging in certain law enforcement actions because you don't want the military can only use being used for law enforcement\nI'd guarding a border is the job of the United states military isn't it\nI I agree the problem is is that when you get asylum law and to the issue if these people are supposedly coming across to claim asylum then that's a law that's being broken and so that's a law enforcement issue and that's really where this Rob comes in and even if you put that that the military at the border you Dan would have to say okay\nUh what ... you'd have to ... they had to cover every stretch of the of the of the border and if they got as you point out uh one foot across the border\nThen what do you do they couldn't asylum and all of a sudden the military has to bring a nice anyone I think if people are going to come to a thousand or one ... how many thousands of miles that is to get here they're just gonna keep on trying until they get a cry\nNow David I Know this is all of a situation where neither one of us has full details but\nThe president early on said to Guatemala and Honduras stop this group or you're going to lose your foreign aid which is something that is within his control I Believe you know the Congress can allocate the money and they have\nAppropriate the money for foreign foreign aid but the president controls how's that dispersed or the president is also said to Mexico\nYou stop this group which they don't appear to be doing right now and if you don't stop them you may just lose that us MCA trade deal\nAnd it's and and I and and it appeared I taught at the beginning when the president made that threat by tweet or the Mexico was going to take that seriously is that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits\n... we will stop them in our country or is it to Mexico's benefit to uh some there no some it snows at at President Trump and say we're gonna let him keep on going\nYou figure out what to do with them on that once they get north or your border\nYeah I mean I think this this is further complicated by the fact that right now you are looking at a incoming New Mexico ... so even if we had a perfect partner in Mexico they were doing exactly what we wanted them to do\nThat's not necessarily the case and you know a couple of months the new incoming Mexican administration has indicated you less willingness to cooperate with the United states as somebody now David out that was that was the campaign so we don't know but still that's not a good sign\nI very much appreciate judgment she said to David in Sarah from ah the Heritage Foundation we appreciate it you know if you're

Larson\nShow come back to the Lars Larson shows so many things are at stake depending on who ends up controlling the house and the Senate after the November\nMidterms two weeks from today and I've decided to bring Grover Norquist on who is president of Americans for tax reform we've had you on so many times before Grover to talk purely tax consequences but once you stake if the Democrats take control of even the house of representatives let alone the sun\nWell they take the house in other things they'll just sit and do a bunch of\nUh get best occasions or as you solid they tried to do to cabinet um they could do that to everybody who works for the federal government are and how you up and\nHave somebody invented accusation about you from X number of years ago and go on and on and I I mean there's there's no end to what they can do if somebody\nIs having reasonable regulations at the EPA all and then on X Y and Z who knows a day could subpoena records tax records and the leak of a and I'm just in the president's I mean they they say they want to do that of course there was something well you think about the leak\nThose talk right it's a long time ago they've done it to other conservative a and other conservative groups I think they would not hesitate to do it to the president you know they believe that there were some interesting thing there um but they could do it to anybody a so\nOne is the abuse of their subpoena power and show on a you know the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean much if they can subpoena something and then throw it out to the press or there are certainly going to go for gun control or they will push for massive new spending member when we wanted to\nBegin to rebuild the military after the Obama years they said oh yeah but only if we get a dollar for dollar\nFor welfare spending any dollar you want to put into national defense we need is another dollar to go into welfare and that was the deal they drove than McCain agreed to that McCain was the one who was pushing the the defense spending and the double the cost of defense spending by paying the bride or extortion a\nThat he felt was necessary to get the national defense spending\nHe doubled the cost of defense spending by paying the bride or extortion a\nThat he thought was necessary to get the national defense spending but that will happen again and again so more spending a it's a death tax cuts no Democrat in the house or the Senate voted for a tax cut they voted against every tax cuts voted for every tax increase uh\nIncluding the belly ... trillion trillion trillion dollars are taxes and a ... only some of which has been ... not all of it not even most of the tax increases in Obamacare\nTo all those things are going to happen which makes it doubly important than Republicans turn out in November\nI have to always think could Grover 'cause I happen to live in a state Washington state that has vote by mail so the ballots are already out in people's hands and in some cases are actually marking the ... for most of the country\nIt's the sixth of the November or that they have to focus on because that is the day you actually go to the polls boy do I wish we still went to the polls but I was thinking about you and your group the other day when his hearing a long discussion on a liberal talk show about Donald Trump and his father and the way that his father figure it out to leave money for his kids\nAnd I remember thinking the Democrats seem to think that it's evil that any parent would try to leave as much of what they can leave after the government's done with them or to their kids\nAnd I look at it I heard it and I thought well time\nI was really admiring the way that to his father figured out ways to make sure that his kids five of them were well ... you know well provided for men that they had a good START I would think that any American parent would say I want to leave my kids whatever I can leave them apparently the Democrats are the liberals don't share that point of view\n[noise] their view is the government will tell organized government to steal money for their kids or the ... I think one of the best things that we know about the United states is that the death tax it's fewer than five percent of people depending on how you want to\nMeasure directly directly it's not as many people by destroying the jobs are cutting their businesses and farms and out in terms of you know\nYou pay you after you pay the tax made it like uh the farm that gets cut in half the business that gets cut now everybody who worked for it and they'd be in trouble but less than five percent Seventy percent of Americans have consistently sat\nOr that they want the death tax Chappelle show Seventy percent so at least sixty five percent American says I don't have the death tax not likely to pass that fact but I just think it's wrong to tax somebody again and again and again\nUh on income that they've already paid taxes on at least once and and maybe more than once a depending on how they they are in the dollar a\nThat's a healthy country that is not a country or that Obama thought he was president has written by a and they remember on this comment when somebody said well you know why don't you cut the capital gains tax you know\nWhenever we've cut the capital gains tax revenue goes up when we've increased Catholic as actually gotten it actually\nGets less money do you really want to raise the capital gains tax even if it\nCosts the government resident said yes yes it's still the right thing to do so this was not about having more money to build a bridge or do something constructive this was I Would rather have a tax\nOn success for people\nTo punish them meant to hurt them even though I Know it will hurt people who depend on government spending court it on people work for the army or are they the legitimate functions of the government or even though it hit hurt them he's still liked the idea of the tax\nOn capital gains shout and he was more important than helping then whatever the government's supposed to be doing it and helping poor people that the military um all those things that the government says that it does with our love or money or the American people are not where\nObama was which has consumed by and they\nAnd covered in other people's stuff I mean and is one of the seven deadly sins and the Democrats act like it's a political program\nYou point out that sixty five Seventy percent of Americans don't like this and as you say these are people who could very easily say I'll never be as rich or I Would not be so rich or to be able to have\nTo pay the death tax but I don't want anybody else to pay it either so you're right sixty percent of it maybe sixty five percent of Americans don't have that kind of envy\nAnd Obama's attitude toward money you remember when he said at some point you made enough money\nWell he is at this point the current estimates are that he's worth about forty million dollars he was worth about three million dollars when he came in and into the presidency and here we are two years out of his presidency sounds worth forty and the asteroids are he'll have made a quarter billion dollars about Fifteen Years in ...\nAnd here we are two years out of his presidency sounds\nWorth forty and the asteroids are he'll have made a quarter billion dollars about Fifteen Years in do you suppose anybody is going to remind him of what he said and say so President Obama when you've got to a hundred million was that enough how about a hundred and a quarter you know how 'bout how 'bout to when you got to two hundred million\nAnd you knew that the interest alone in that two hundred million would be about ten\nMillion dollars or in earnings on it would be about ten million dollars a year that you would earn for the rest of your life without giving another speech or anything else is that what you meant by enough money and if it isn't enough how much is enough\nI'll lose the question I guess I guess that's the clearly not enough ah it yet there is a tremendous sad apocryphal um friends on the left\nOr the day and the other people's money they and the other people's success or and it's very sad it's a unfortunate but we can avoid that being the leadership of the country and as you were saying everybody needs to remember this vote\nPlease if it's if it's male by boat take your uh your belt thing to deliver it to the polls mail it to the polls do not leave without people do not throw it away people got dumped dumpster diving and\nThat kind of like they sell those to the local democratic committee chairman a book by now it was designed for ... easier on an possible and ah\nFor building structures in America that gives you said well\nIn every state we're going to have some individual peculiar these like building in a while you versus building in Alaska but we should all have an agreement that there are certain things that are always going to build a certain way if we build an education system is not inherently bad but as I said it became political and it became full of fads\nAnd as you said a lot of parents would look at math\nAnd say in particular and say I have no idea what you're talking about I don't know how to help you with their homework\nYou know you're exactly right and it especially becomes a problem we're talking it second first and second grade in that parents are are are having trouble with it's not even the high school math which is where I my background is high school math and and\nHow do we get rid of that well like you said it it it's tall attack and it has to come from the bureaucracies from the top because Tom import comes from the top and not the inherent issue of Thomas or is it a top down at such that the education was born it takes power\nOut of the hands of the experts as you called me um the teachers and make sure that some powerful bureaucrats\nAt the top level many of them never have stepped foot into a foster homes are the ones that are dictating well why um students are learning how they are learning it and when they are learning it so I\nI I take an Adam Smith approach to to education um I Believe that competition is is how at schools are going to become better competition for better teachers\nThat points to increase or learning and and and numbers and that's and turned going to ah bring more tax dollars into a school district that has the schools um standard nationalizing education at first like you said\nOh on first glance sounds like a good thing um you know if you're moving from West Virginia to Connecticut you want to believe that your child will fit into the grades that the states as the child she's there yeah but that is just not what is happening unfortunately and ah it's so important because\nNow education has become a political issue and and we have to vote the people in the office that are are going to make sure our kids have the best education and and set up the line on our teachers want why politician\nYou know while we've got the time tonight city in city Adams is the director of education for the foundation for liberty in American greatness which was fired um why are we teaching kids about the constitution and I I Know that for some people they think well ...\nHow does not apply to my kids daily life for the fact is that where you interact with your employees some day when you're an employer or as an employee interact with your employer when you're first out of school boy you interact with the police or with a local government a lot of them\nYou have to know the constitutional rights that are guaranteed in the documents and what the government to love to do and what is not allowed to do I think to make you you know is sensible daily choices and even choices of the ... we're all going to do in a couple of weeks\n... you're exactly\nAnd to make it you know is sensible daily choices and even choices at the ballot box like we're all going to do in a couple of weeks\n... you're exactly right and an easy answer to that\nIs that Common Core on measures by English language arts and by math and so the constitution or it can be used as an English language arts resource but it left secondary as a\nInstead of ... historical document that kids should know before they graduate high school and\nWhat does that about this is the worst thing you look at the millennial generation which I I and as hard as and my generation increasingly that it's not like the country that they that they were born and killed and and and that's the only it's become a sad\nTalked about why you don't like this country\nI Believe that it was impossible to have that opinion as as a matter of fact if you notice and all you know wider founding fathers I set up the constitution the way they did the guarantee that you and I was able to keep our rights as opposed to the government giving us our life\nAnd I just think ... comments or as a whole set of students and teachers and parents um dictating how how's that their education as whether it's ...\nIt's their their education and their their educational rights are coming from that the high level that love your office and um and so on that's a side effect the common core is that\n... has decreased and as a result the satisfaction of a country is decree thing I thought was my on it and\nUh how how does it tell me that you know usa deserve nine eleven\nUm are gone I I I think that my stomach and and stay there because I was that you know teaching now I couldn't talk about it I Will bowled I\nI I just think she may be maybe a field trip to Venezuela would have straighten them out on a few things like that

everything that went on from Kavanaugh yeah even though\nIt is an all it's it's it's more than just that but to me that was the symbol that it showed a lot of people that look okay we're all Republicans most of us are conservatives yeah we even if we're moderate and moderate conservatives we can't\nHave that party in power because they've been blondes\nAbout what they believe in and we and we do believe I I Believe this is part of their statement we do believe that if they don't believe in the constitution if they don't believe in due process if they don't believe in the first amendment if they don't believe in the second amendment people are being blood and saying well then what makes you American\nYeah and I know sounds probably ... to some people but if you don't believe in you and I've talked about this for the longest time if you don't believe in the constitution if you don't believe in those basic tenants than what do you actually believe in well and and\nWhat kind of country do you really want right what is it that you want a\nYour country to be you know you look at the the never Trump or is the conservatives and I think the Kavanaugh effect was was a you know something that was eye opening for\nA lot of them who realized okay a couple of times\nOr this president has shown a his efforts in terms of the highest court you and I by the way can can officially call this the Breitbart Andrew Breitbart effect\nYes because and twenty twelve just weeks before he died or we asked him as as we were talking to them why should we support or a moderate like Mitt Romney was inevitable Mitt Romney was going to become the nominee or appeared he would even early that here\nOr why should we do that and his answer was guys I'm a stone's throw as I sit here and talk to you from SCOTUS it's all about SCOTUS so\nThey're ... it's it's different you can have a conservatives say well never Trump and maybe maybe I you know think about it and twenty twenty in terms of ah you know we'll look and see what what happens in twenty twenty ride I didn't vote for him and twenty sixteen I stayed home or whatever\nBut in terms of the mid term\nWhile you have said supporting Trump there there are a couple of things at least Trump will do this on ... so I've got to get out I've got to vote I've got to be motivated to get out there and allow him to be able to possibly seat another constructions\nBut it's exactly what you said to it is they're they're you were going to have to build that Republican wall around the constitution and around the process that is in place that preserves the constitution\nAnd and I think that's really a strong it at us a strong and\nRound the process that is in place that preserves the constitution\nAnd and I think that's really a strong it it has a strong addition to uh\nThe Trump momentum mhm to have conservatives who are idiot logically driven\nWho didn't know the constitution and do know and our stream Lee fearful of what came out of Democrats during the cabinet nomination which to them really has nothing to do with Trump\nBut it is all United in that same any allergies I like to call it the republic because you've called that a couple of times and Republican wall meanwhile we played a couple of of audio cuts from from President ... a former President Obama for reasons mhm and that was\nI'm Still looking for what was the major issue\nBecause look if you look at cabinet what came out of cabinet and and I I specifically go back to a conversation that I had at my at my family reunion I and this was a a gentleman who I talked to the relative by marriage mhm okay\nIs a professor and an extremely liberal college and from what I have known him as for the longest time because of other friends with no him\nA very very big liberal right very big liberal we had the most amazing conversation in July most amazing conversation went on for over an hour\nAnd you know very quiet conversation just you know what do you think whatever and he just told me he said you don't have liberal I Am I said well I've heard of we've never had a long discussion he goes I'm pretty liberally goes\nThe campuses are insane 'cause they're not liberal I'm a liberal goes maybe I'm an old 'cause I never thought I'd think of myself as an old time liberal when I found out is he's ... he's a lot like for example look Camille paleo ... you know he's an old traditional\nA liberal and he talked about Trump because look you know Trump's of stuff that goes but look a lot of stuff to Trump says actually because when he goes too far actually helps us a little bit some people may claim they really care about are offended but their nominees but the fact is he goes my dad\nLoves Donald Trump ... my dad died before Donald Trump run ran in a won the presidency but my dad would have voted for Donald Trump ... ... ... not a racist I don't know what you know it's not a racist and and he said he goes but he goes our party because my party is killing itself\nAnd I wonder if I had a conversation with him today after Kavanaugh 'cause Eric you don't want you and I both know that the average Democrat I'm Talking about the work in the ... the working class Democrat who you know who lives in so many cities across the United states I Know who they are because I grew up with them\nMy family part of my family is from that\nWorking kind of a Democrat family I Know\nThey you know we're Democrats came from in the north east you know we talked about Tim Russert ... you know and and it when if you ever read any of his books I mean he came from a south buffalo Democrat Party but they're very conservative mhm extremely conservative you know morally speaking and that's been passed down through generations\nYou'd think the average rank and file\nAverage working class Democrat related to the Democrats saying that evidence doesn't matter that due process doesn't matter\nThat the presumption of innocence doesn't matter you notice nobody's rallying around that anymore right now nobody's using that as a campaign thing no Democrats going out right now screaming always believe her\nMhm if you if you voted ... if you voted Republican in the Republicans going to vote for due process we cannot have due process we cannot have a presumption of innocence they may have been saying it two or three weeks ago they're not saying that now they can't sell it\nNo they can sell it to their own party so what are they selling\nTheir selling Trump fear and maybe a little bit of\nThe increased premiums for our for a a ... as they call it Trump carrying around a but is that actually going to have an effect right now no no I don't see that having an affair it might have had more of an effect if the whole cabinet thing hadn't happened\nBecause health care costs have been going up forever they were going up during the Obama years I mean after they put the the even out Obamacare remember the first couple of years\nLook at the ... as we went through twenty sixteen the increase there are a politically you can't get away with that anymore because it is it's going to go up people with ... with with an employer based health care\nNo the costs are going up\nSo the only thing that resonates forget about saying well a Trump care is is ... raising premiums\nNobody cares about that it's about what are you going to give me if you're going to you know again appeal to somebody who is on the left right\nEveryone but but other people but you know something the the free stuff and we talked about that earlier with Cory bookers you know the new new

license plates in their parking area about twenty five percent of all the traffic early on\nUh for the new MGM casino is from Connecticut why yeah twenty five percent one in four people are crossing the border\nAnd are um ... yeah yeah that many yeah mhm\n[noise] yeah I'll add up\nBorder and our I'm wrong but that aren't a yeah yeah that many yeah mhm [noise] now\nAnd of course an open this past August uh MGM Springfield downtown they spent nine hundred and sixty million dollars on the casino in downtown but here in the great state of Connecticut we snooze\nWe we we snooze we we have studies and we have commissions oh yeah and he had who you have the legislative battles if it's going to take a sign of how well\nHow many years of the road or how many years we're going to look over the ruined in Springfield now see the governor on his hands and knees later on that\nTest I think everything but in Springfield because Hartford snooze and they lost Twenty years ago and I was doing shows in the middle of all that you know as the wind came in and wanting to put something here in downtown Hartford so now when was on the show yeah I Know he was asked was may I talk to him at other outlet yeah but again\nUh you know Hartford snooze and said no and Bridgeport snooze when a guy named Donald Trump wanted to put a casino there yeah\nSo now you know other states benefit and now a twenty five percent of the ... of the traffic to the new Springfield casino has Connecticut license plates on it so there you go that doesn't surprise of course not\nOf course we hold them that when they were as deciding the Belgian ... yes and and ... you know how many years of people have been going around here Brad\nWhen when when people like you and I have been saying what are you waiting for somebody else was going to jump on this and it ended up being Springfield so again\nYou snooze you lose that you know\nThat's awful and I want to tell you something yeah we're checking were checking roads were checking\nRoads boy [laughter] I Want to I mean we've got it's all about tolls tunnels and ...\nAnother thing we're snoozing on bread and I mentioned it on this show numerous that even before was approved were snoozing on this sports betting this sports gambling that that that the Supreme Court\nAllowed to you know happened now legally you know to put the bookies out to be well\nRhode Island's coming online pretty soon New Jersey is already on line Massachusetts it's getting close and New York state is within a couple of votes and their general assembly about you know okay and what's going on in Connecticut so we have to have more\nWe have to have more studies you know George ...\nThe outgoing attorney general to you and I've talked to several times\nBrad they can't even figure out this is how bad\nThe deal is that we have with the Indian casinos in eastern part of the state [noise] nobody can seem to figure out literally if we go with sports gambling if the Native American tribes get to run it or if they have first dibs on running it\nBecause the agreement that Mr Weicker signed apparently from what I've been told\nBy it is that's none of them and their ... that's the agreement\nBut the agreement is so foggy about sports gambling and other sort of ancillary things nobody and even Mr Jeffs and sad or a I think a few months ago and members of the general assembly miss Eris him away it's dumb as Claritin and people like that\nI nobody can figure it out Brad and meantime we sit here you know the state of Connecticut does [noise] I Know we we we snooze it that way to do something yeah\nThat would be one of 'em just said things hit me fast yeah I can see your face if we could get ... on a billboard and me going on a billboard yeah and we have three or four of them around the state yeah and had you I'll push the button and\nAnd and we'll have you uh knew that he knows and you know as a wonderful post office\nStandard I mean if you're not a stream left liberal you've got to be sitting at your kitchen table listening to us this morning having coffee even if you're a Democrat even if you're a liberal Democrat you got to be saying well you know we just can't afford to take in the ... all the rules hungry all of the world sick we can't do it\nNow you know something there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong for standing up for this country because we know some of the people that were gonna get we've already been through it and I just I I just don't think it's going to work I truly don't think it's going to ...\nOther people that were going to get we've already been through it and I just I I just don't think it's going to work I truly don't think it's gonna work I think they're going to strike out on this one I really do\nAnd and and that and look at what the president is doing Lee which I think is is is very smart along was saying he would use the military he's also saying to countries like Guatemala and Mexico and other countries you know you let these people through and I'm going to cut off your foreign aid and fun right\nYeah I had that this my absolutely\nShould actually go back to Mexico and say listen I I have no problem ripping off this latest deal because if you guys don't help us with this whole rip up this latest trade deal and will either start over I'll make a better deal for us because the deal they have right now is pretty damn good and you know and by the way Mexico is not this\nI mean listen there are places in Mexico that are extremely poor but don't get this miss I miss information that Mexico is one of the poorest countries on the\nPlan well let me tell you something one of our folks brews\nHe went to Mexico and he's one of our producers he went to Mexico a week ago it was down there for three days and and uh yes there were some areas that were terrible he however yeah he said brat\nHe said there were some areas to that or you\nWouldn't think anything happened all know the the the the economic impact of tourism and Mexico's a multi billion dollar industry time absolutely\nAnd this and there were videos last night and we talked about this month ago you know where they showed video Fox News showed a video last night of ... like a tent city and it was row after row after tens and people outside and people sleeping in these outdoor tens and you know you you know it was horrible the conditions were terrible and all of that\nAnd you know your your your thought oh my God ears with these people are going through down in uh in Mexico on their way here but no that was actually in California\nAnd that was one of the ... yeah that was out of the tent\nCities in California yeah so we can handle our own problem yeah never mind the rest of the world's ... amazing amazingly amazing stuff\nWell I I think this is just my gut feeling I think that the the people\nAnd all the different nationalities that had been here\nI don't know if you've seen some of the the the things that they are concerned about they're concerned about the folks that we're talking about coming in here and kind of taking over for them and they don't want that either right now that as soon as I was\nHere if I was here legally if I was the for Mexico or wherever South America and I got here legally and I worked in ... everything that was the through the proper channels I'd be mad as hell right\nI mean 'cause I Know here I Am waiting in line filled out all the right paperwork you're on pay my taxes I'm doing what I'm supposed to do and you're going to let five thousand fourteen thousand twenty five thousand people in I I that's just not fair either way all three of us right now we're talking about this on the air\nThe extreme left you know what they consider us we're all racist\nYelling at all racist white privilege and all that ah lately and closing but I got to tell you right because uh some of the most anti illegal immigrant calls I've taken on this station or any other\nHave been from and I'm sure you have the same ... you're going to say have been from\nImmigrants who have come here right right away and said the Fifteen twenty thirty forty thousand dollars for a a immigration fees and the immigration lawyer and waited for years and got a sponsor family those are the folks that are just cross it off about this\n... a hundred percent I could not agree with you more and by the way just because I Want everybody to know we're talking to her sister station WBRC I Know they've got to run and just a second but uh they're doing a fantastic job up in Hartford we're proud and honored to have them as part of the full power radio team and\nI got my trust the calculator out the ... yeah and there are twenty five there's supposedly twenty five million illegals in this country and let's say for argument's sake they they've been coming in for the last forty five years if you get your calculator out that comes out to about one minute\nSo I Know that we have\nFourteen thousand on the way but the problem or to exist here already\n... and I'm going to stick to I think what Donald Trump said yesterday hit a grand slam home run with the people I really really do even some that didn't like him\nSome yeah there is a shadow modern people little agree and never say they're like ... hours you had to go on now by my yep he referred they're bred to something that kind of flew under the radar a couple of weeks ago [noise] you know you we've always heard the term welders\nEleven million illegals general up while there was a Yale study that came out it believes in gale study\nA couple of weeks ago and it made they got some headlines but not a lot a new Yale study Brad said that no the figure is not ten or eleven million\nWeeks ago and it made

patch\nThis we're going to throw a patch and this we're gonna jury rigged this so it stays together the problem is rat\nEverybody wants infrastructure repairs on the local level the state level a national level but they realize it takes money and and and you know that's the problem and he again Brad I always say\nWhen a politician says we need these tax revenues to do all this infrastructure because you know the roads that you drive on the bridge is most people say okay but you know what I don't trust you\nThat's the problem ... that's the problem whether its toll\nThe bridge is most people say okay but you know what I don't trust you\nThat's the problem ... that's the problem whether its toll or infrastructure funding or what the governor wants to do nobody's going to argue that you don't have\nTo fix the roads and bridges they you remember how bad the ... river thing in ... oh I remember a nerve or the governor yes and and and bill O'Neil God rest his soul he raised all those taxes overnight but again over thirty year span only about half that money went to where it\nWas supposed to go and this is a complete this is not just a here this is a national uh situation to\nA fellow by the name of John Reilly one of the\nForemost experts on this whole situation around the country is is part of it but we've got to make some changes\nAnd a woman's shower stall\nNo one

yeah they don't\nHave to have any any kind of biological testing they don't have to have anything that says that they're gonna see this is this is where they're\nThey're they're destroying terminology that terminology that they use and they have redefined just like the term\nAnd a um ... you know what to sex me today they're saying facts is the genitalia that's what the the the the the progressive liberals want us to understand that\nGender is not what we think that's what the ... liberals why that is not what the general people of America One let's put it that way\nOr the department of health and Human Services right now it's spearheading efforts to establish a new legal definition of facts\nUnder title nine of the um of the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education programs um that receive government financial assistance that is it's happening like yesterday they announced it and they're trying\nTo come up with the proper definition that can be used not just insanity and did you know I just wanted to say one year Connecticut\nWrote the law on this nationally I mean that's Connecticut floods being used across the country for further is transgender cultural mark that I didn't define nature and\nAnd denying everything that we know and that is true\nYeah and then your identity on\nOne thing I wanted a ... you said something that I think needs a little further explanation couple of minutes we have left the state by state\nThere are states that if you want to compete or or like you say compete in an event as a woman named when you're really a guy or do something different you know use the bathroom a differently there are states where there are requirements for a certain amount of time of\n... therapy and things like that a doctor's supervision and all those\nWhat am I correct to assume you're the Connecticut as wide open their ... their doesn't need to be any sort of even medical consultation here\nOh well that doesn't have to

I Know he's talked about this trucks all he has all the time which people say is illegal you couldn't do that would jeopardize our federal highway funds ... is is the warning an attorney here Len after election day\nI Believe it's a distinct possibility and think about this not only is the ... the truck to all things being litigated in Rhode Island yeah it's really up for grabs but not only that let's say\nIt turns out to be legitimate and you can do it the cost of instill installing the toll injuries according to this study that already been done would run anywhere from four hundred and fifty million just six hundred and thirty five million dollars yeah you're going to have to install the same number of coconut trees for trucks is you would for cars\n... and there was also a story land I Know what he saw this and Brad was a story I saw last night they have this so called trucks only toll is at Indiana lands on two weeks ago I saw that I think it was Indiana and now you know what's happening\nThe people on the local roads are going crazy because you have all these trucks and big race going out to the local roads to try and avoid a toll\nLocal roads are going crazy because you have all these trucks and big race going on to the local roads to try to avoid the toll of course of course by the way\nIf the commissioner read any of the three studies have been done already a thousand five hundred pages the consultants warned about that\nThat that that what they call the brewers are would occur and they estimate depending on how much the tools are are they tend to thirty percent of the tropical divert off the highway do with the tools and wrecking havoc on the local roads which is exactly what you're pointing out right now all of a bread uh it's it's it's a serious problem and\nI just say this is a public official is going to make a statement based on facts in quotes\nHe owes it to the public to the ... you can't have it both ways you say oh I'm going to influence the commission will make this much this decision and I'm but I'm not going to tell you that uh you know where I got those numbers just trust me he ... he owes it to the public\nI mean I'm Still a Yankee fan yeah but I picked the red socks this year to prove something that I could get one or two right and this is right and when that's right nobody calls me ... I'll tell you what is the other way and then all\nThe time but what happened the last two years Brad well\nIt only matters when you win that's all that's all it matters right bury just remember thanks for the call buddy just remember the Yankees are God's team and don't ever for yeah\nAll right we'll be right now and why we get along there's there's a reason the Yankees or the premiums are gone for years to come on come on it's the New York Yankees or an international brand nobody cares about the red Sox and Japan nobody cares\nNobody cares God Bless the red Sox are having a great year there

Gillum responded now he's trying to shape and shape the story to make it seem as if oh I thought he only reserve the tickets and my brother paid for them and just handed them to me well that this story is starting to slip and\nSlide all over the place and this is a critical race for Donald Trump this is probably of all the races across the country it's the most important or the governorship of the great state of Florida because of its effect on the twenty twenty campaign and of course the Florida is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country's going\nA bit CNN is even heading at the FBI probes centers on whether developers successfully influence city project at one point in the program undercover agents successfully infiltrated Gillum inner circle\nNo one's been charged with any wrongdoing and killings repeatedly said he's not the focus of the investigation but his attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyists and longtime friend Adam Corey along with his brother in a federal agent\nWho went by the name Mike Miller has been used by political opponents to suggest Gillum it's potentially under more direct scrutiny you want to elect somebody who could very well be ... down the road indicted by the federal government given this given this story\nThis is getting worse he he could be under even even more criminal trouble let's check in first with chip Roy a there's an interesting piece in Politico meet the next Ted Cruz November chip Roy is likely to be elected to Congress top House Republicans worry\nThat he'll be two the rights of the Freedom Caucus that's music

further than the Senate you issue committees clamp show a lot of talk\nOh well you see this the situation in Texas where moral Latino and we and Raymond ... found this out when he went to the Trump rally or this week are a special correspondent there there are so many Latino voters Latino American legal immigrants into the United states is and what are we doing\nThis is just ridiculous they're all for Trump to offer crews and obviously they're all going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for yet why did they want to turn this country and to the countries they left\nWell there's no question really tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail and I talked to drop this district and all the taxes\nThe strongest advocates for border security on those immigrants who come here whether there's going to or not particularly in Spanish and taxes are coming here legally they know what they got in your ... separate\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democrat Party particular and frankly some Republican or\nA a you have a supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so they look the message of border security and strong immigration and standing up for our country is selling well and by the way who would I Know\nIt is much better for immigrants that we have a secure border I'm tired of watching this girl was getting sold in a psychiatric industry riding on the topic train cars bombs dying it doesn't because we were your base are sovereign ...\nA ship 'em well we know you're going to do really well ah and we know that uh you will be a force\nFor law and order less government a smart fiscal policy deregulatory efforts where we need to deregulate and we can never let Texas ever let Texas go blue\nBecause Texas just like Florida I'm Talking about this Andrew Gillum isn't here isn't here and then he has a story to tell jokes ah but you know we were both states are critical I mean all states are important but the the left has taken over California and we see what the result cannot let this happen cannot let this has on Texas or Florida\nThat's absolutely right as Texas goes so goes who goes America you're absolutely right in Florida was about ... and they really\nNeed to get that election rock writing I'm quite sure hope will they will but also a say this I Can't thank you for having Christian Vargas longer show the other night a on a on Fox\nAnd for being a champion for that family a wonderful family who obviously lost a crust allows her nephew I'm already Vargas lost her son Jared ... in June they live uh in around by just for a while but working harder than ever happen\nThere that's a great family and a thank you for highlighting that in just as they're standing up and willing to say that they weren't married me strong border security and the rule of law being reestablished on a leash\nOn they said the Vargas family told us that you were really the the one politician who came out and really gave them support they heard nothing\nOr from the Castro brothers zippo from them including\nWalking Castro who's a congressman from that district her nothing from so chip thank you so much I Know you're going to do fantastically well and we can't wait to interview when you become a the next Congress men from the twenty first district of Texas so we've come on come on the show after when\nI'd be delighted to I really appreciate everything you do and we can commiserate I'm also a University of ... uh but I Know you went to law school there so we can we can talk about our great Charlottesville is\nBut I alright ... All right we're going to take a break on the lower income so a lot more to get to a care and housing up next\n\n\n\nWho've been allowed to come to the United states eighty thousand plus live in Saint Paul area of Minnesota obviously a big rural community as well a and one of the most beautiful states uh one of my favorite places it's been a soda or a car in a joins us now the races pretty ...\nUnity as well a and one of the most beautiful states or one of my favorite places as Minnesota a car in a joins us now the races pretty tight uh the latest real poll shows that the Democrat is up I'm about six percent\nAnd I think that is within striking distance no doubt about it a car and it's good to have you with us how are things going on the trail\nUh it's gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have closed the gap in the cold or the one you're speaking I was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune which we sometimes call the red star\nA and that one had the damages sex and then the one before that and other Democrats all happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state meeting in green folk and\nHad a big debate the other night uh are only state wide televised debate and my opponent a chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have made some fairly significant headway in in a both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and uh\nSince uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this was all positive why would people want to vote against them now\n[noise] or early don't ah we had a or Minnesota is turning ... cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina let's didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she stole our\nLast in Seoul extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground a and then she's also\nA for open borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him yet\nUh being as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh uncalled for another investigation so Minnesotans are are\nSome of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and that we have some of the ... we have the highest turned out in the country when it comes to voting and\nSo we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith did want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave\nOf democratic fund raising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates are Paulson and Jason Lewis and there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates But Ryan says there's an enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state\nUh last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened to your ... so we go to look for and how and we could have told you what was going to happen um\nMinnesota is definitely turning red reflect our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen oh we've got up on the iron range which has voted Democrat\nFor more than sixteen years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen ... all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody it's fighting for our farmers and putting their issues at the forefront of a campaign\nSo it's all it's all the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue waving his I'm\nNot feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind a the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally\nThis cycle here in Minnesota\nThere's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state or\nAlex he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota there is a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nIs even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know banks that she'll be able to just snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need\nOur politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo ... to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so ... current housley has got to win the seat that\nWould be phenomenal news as we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he didn't win it last time around but he made a ... valley and attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory a car and thank you so much best of luck in that race or for that Senate seat\nA that was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All right we'll take a break eight five five forty Laura we have a lot more to get to a this Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas debate tonight is going to be critical\nOf by the way oh by the way there's a story I forgot I was going to mention the current Mexican man admits faking his own kidnapping in Saint Paul Minnesota to gain a visa\nAuthorities say a Mexican immigrant in the United states illegally was bound with duct tape and less near Randolph avenue and as part of his own kidnapping ruse to try to fraudulently obtained a visa\nDesigned to help crime victims oh I've heard of all you want to let them into the country at this point because it's such a clever

total crack mess and I are of a certain time it's on a\nWay overboard but this is not one of the cases which has gone way overboard\nA and I don't want to make too much of this most people haven't seen a what a you know they haven't seen you know and then Kelly show they're not even known here about it but I Want to make too much credit Melvin was not happy Les Wilson\nWas some criticism yesterday on live there this was political correctness run among um that's doing its mission juniors and it's it's it's just as in races as a statement itself\n[noise] All right a lot more coming up John dreamed up now\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd I am very critical uh Michigan Senate race where people didn't think that Stabenow was going to be in any way vulnerable but this case this a race is down to the wire\nAnd uh several polls now indicating that you know this could go Republican the Republican away if things turn out the way I think they're going to turn out\nAnd with John James now getting the media attention in the air time he deserves a but not as much as Andrew Gillum of courses who Andrew Gillum is he can't he can't do any wrong even when he does wrong or John James joins us now John it's great to talk to you you were fantastic\nOn the anger mangled last night we get we got terrific response to your parents I Know it was short but that's the nature of TV how you doing today\nI'm doing great and thanks for having me back on\nA John tell us a first of all I Want your reaction to this\nA series of comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John your comments\nOr a I think that folks get so wrapped around the actual around the around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great artists that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans into battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home you know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics\nAre the only things that are that look the same on us our our uniforms\nAre we are together all American and I don't have a black message or white Mrs I said last night but a red white and blue message and I I feel like you have\nUm the the progressive Marxist on the left who don't have a message\nThey don't have an identity so we need to use identity politics in order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together is exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the alerts to claim racism\nOr at every turn and to claim it's either a combination of ... being a wild or racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is ... it's so disgusting on so many levels and an insulting to Holocaust survivors and you know all people everywhere but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn this Michigan Senate race clearly has no ideas she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nThis this is a basic this is absolutely based you know we we learned the amount of the case of angers class the logical fallacies ad hominem attack\nOr when you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on Debbie Stabenow a for her part\nHas been a career politician for three years of collective four million dollars from the tax payers only gotten five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she\nA hooker co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she anything but she's a solid a is a New York senator\nLoaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five Ninety ... some of the time respectively and the promises she's made around ... around Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around taking care of education and around um funding emergency\nAh funding for our troops who are deployed and and our veterans were coming back home she's broken palms and so when I say to her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan the half\nIs why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected they will engage in this politics to drive us apart and what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we end all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this a lot of Debbie Stabenow now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nOf majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\n'em in a better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants to forty four year year career and politics to continue suddenly she's Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\n[noise] she she is a selective uh in in her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her\nI'm centers to have it on and you can see our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she supports sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our border she's been up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is something we need to get done right now all we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who's going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if W stamina gets re elected on national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction\nAmong African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran are you a West Point graduate\nAre you um you're a Republican which is is you know is is not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know still have a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting more\nBlack support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me as people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color my skin\nOr they begin to realize that hey guys\nUm this this guy me I'm won a Republican primary in a in the state and ah I'm going to be the only African American at the top of the ballot\n... and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying a rings true and you take a look at ... now has failed to do ah with with with what concerns African Americans and uh and Michigan as regards the race round the state or they're taking a look at this keeping an open mind and beginning to come over\nUh I I Believe that the only ones who are not are ones who ah who can't see past a of a a blind hatred or blind allegiance but those who I'm Talking talking to who are keeping an open mind and I recognize the I'm the best leader\nUm for Michigan into the future or bringing balance an actual experience on both from a combat environment understanding veterans' issues and national security and from a business environment understanding how to create jobs and how to protect the American dream for future generations to include our

incredible history of music and arts and architecture talked and and it was amazing decades of Democrat rule\nHave destroyed so many great American cities like Baltimore and in St Louis and and now are of course to try to make something of a comeback but\nUh so much more needs to be done John James best of luck to you and your race against Debbie Stabenow in Michigan uh everybody get out there and support a John he's just a fantastic a young man and a ... he has the right ideas for the state\nAnd he ... he doesn't want to be considered a African American Republican candidate he wants to be

thank you for taking my call they sure what's up well\nI have a question for you I'm I'm now considered unanswerable and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm In or if you cost there are some of us that are considered uninsured herbal so our one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental deaths insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance [noise]\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not ... history of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history okay\nHave you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do like a [noise] a ... a double check\nBroker on dry up or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation so that's great news is ... hopefully is a short lived issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that's the other thing you've got to look at it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental deaths at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidentally up as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance or what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment\nInsurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay in order to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining us America we're glad you're\nFor like three to five five two to five Chelsea's in Los Angeles high Chelsea how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nHourly paid versus salary my my husband is transitioning trip condition I'm aware they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that he raised there I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay\nShe usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether that the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours that he was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct answer what was his income last year including the overtime with about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nA ... that's the kind that we don't know yet\nBecause we're going to shower really read it at the salaries fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be working subjectively apply it got\nRight\nYes and that makes sense it's like\nYeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more since we're in the ... member to mhm um I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nRare but but the question the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up and the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management position\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say I would say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWill we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay yeah 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like ... it's almost like you picked up more hours but didn't have to work um usually what I'm saying but ... but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's been and he gets paid forty\nBut he's worked in the same number of hours working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing yeah this is just making sense to you\nYeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential okay long term to long term good career movies moving into leadership in the management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut I'm the you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand\nWhich is our do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us from Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how're you\nDoing good they ... sure what's up [noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm a good income about thirty one thousand dollars a year I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt or about Lebanon thousands of student loan debt\nThat uh that that about six months ago was a lot about Nineteen thousand [noise] I've been working working hard saved my money and paying it off as much as I can do a lot of clubs right now I came up with that\nI've been working working hard and save money and paying it off as much as I can good or not uh cooks right now\nI came up with the idea for an invention mhm and I don't know whether to keep you know the old and my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so [laughter] I mean it kind of want a young lady and financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have an aspiration because I'm In the process I've been have into are going to be a home loan now is just about ... any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying a home until I get that cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOf them twenty thousand dollars a day so the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes there is a a odor the odor either slash a mold I'm with a little small machine that um [laughter] people getting on their own\nOkay and you've made one\nI made a very um rudimentary proud of the tight mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either be at the end of my rainy day fund started coming into my regular cash flow and like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and give me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you\nKnow take the next level and I want I Want to do [laughter] down again by jump off my my debt plan more do I have my invention [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you're a billionaire and you you know you ... what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get 'em out there and test them and make sure that they worked and that there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested uh from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited funds ever be able to sell them you know ... uh I like trying to ah\nContinue to do it the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give you just let's just make up a pretend example okay\nHere's the like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you'd convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the idea works then I'm what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside the test it and then if a place that order they just places deposit with you large enough\nTo build the order\nMhm and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\nThe the guy said dial down uh my rather than just been all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt my student loan debt\nI don't think you have time and much capital on this you've already we're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\nAs the person that but I I did see I'm a ... I wanted to be you know a good good looking crowded\nThat's a night so prominently lived there on Oprah factions [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap this broken [laughter]\nYou're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there and the and the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn foreman function changes and form and function changes in the switch has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this has to that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of them in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the\nUm and then they give you enough money [noise] and there are a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket [noise] except your brain\nMe and they're a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except you're buying power and you're sweating and your smile they're selling it and that's how a lot of these things get off the ground [noise] uh\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they're going to mass production before somebody has proven either the marketplace for the actual ...\nYou're talking to a guy's lost money\nWay those stupid stuff do easy man go easy this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\n\nFor\nYeah thank you how neat course Dave and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and and those

I'm right now there for one a and for three B. and they're with fidelity\nOkay um well the four oh one K. is after tax correct\nSo that doesn't have any penalty to converted to a rough I always suggest\nAs a general rule when you leave your employer take everything that's vested enroll it into an IRA and good growth struck mutual funds you have more accessibility more control and more options to pick from in the open market than you do leaving something behind in trying to manage it through a former employer\nCynics out that I Would not converted to a Ross if it's pre tax unless you're out of debt have your emergency fund and have some extra money to pay the taxes that that creates but the four oh one hey you can go ahead and stick that into a raw that doesn't cost you a dime\nBecause there's already after tax money that's in there um yeah that could be some growth in there that how you don't pay taxes on possibly um but it probably wouldn't be much\nSo just you know ... are you out of debt\n[noise] um I Will be I have about ten thousand dollars left on the phone but um by the time I make this transitional I've covered\nOkay well then the other question is what you're not going to have your emergency phone number ... so we're not we don't do anything to creating taxes so when you sit down with your smart best are pro roll it all over to Iowa raise\nA traditional IRAs unless you can move some of it to a Roth IRA in similar mutual funds um without any taxes and then later on if you want to convert it to her raw from traditional the taxes that are created you just need to be able to pay those in cash\n\n\n\n\nElbows a AAA eight to five five to five [noise] Jacob ... Ramsey what's the best way to decide which payment plan I should go with from my student loans a minimum\nPayments on everything except your smallest alone and throw every dollar you can possibly throw at it when it's gone attack the next one down when it's gone attack the next one down that's called the debt snowball and that is the most efficient way and the most the highest probability way to get out student loan debt\nVery fast and very hard do not get into income based repayment plans do not get into I'm going to pay the minimum I can pay ... pay the freaking maximum you can pay doesn't want Sallie Mae evicted get that old ugly woman out of your house\nShe is not a good roommate you want her to leave\nLouis is on Facebook should pull a thousand dollars on my four one K. to do baby step one\nNo cash out of four O. one K. except to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure\nWhen you take money out of your four o one K they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax right\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent that means you just got charged thirty five percent interest\nIn fact I mean it's not technically interest it's penalties in taxes but you never borrow money thirty five percent interest of bond your baby step one no\nNo no no no no no or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell the only ... percent out that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much\nThe government keeps you in the teeth the government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus you're ... you do not cash out retirement accounts\nUnless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure above save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep from found bankruptcy yeah you would do that but at that point you're\nSave your home yeah or if you're so far in debt is the only way you keep them from bankruptcy yeah you would do that but at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know but definitely not\nNever catch it out to buy a car or you know is is that kind of stupid stuff that people do all the time no\nNever never and it was one of those in Washington DC Hi Anna how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave I'm doing well\nThank you for taking my question sure I'm so into that\nSame sex my husband and I purchased a first home in two thousand and eight the market crash and slash the value of our house now three years ago our family grew and we bought a new home twenty percent down it's been twelve years now and I'll first home it's still not war for worry about it for it and we\nWait a minute wait a minute that that's not economic there's something else going on I ... a few places in the United states of not recovered after twelve years would you buy into that I read or what\nI I don't understand it either 'cause we live in northern Virginia which is like very close to Washington DC and right now it's worth two hundred and Ninety five K they bought it at\nUm according to my realtor and we bought the house at three hundred and fifty K.\nA recent comparative market analysis by quality real estate agent says his house is worth three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me yes\nSo you must have done the world's worst real estate deal\nI I that will likely satellite I we bought the house in two thousand and say you know what our own it up and an eight [laughter] I'm Sorry that you owe on it [noise] um right now we owe about sixty chaotic\nOh solid crown wishes ballot it's crap orange washed house as well as we've here's the thing to do it so much\nSo you don't think we should wait for it we we don't know why are you willing to suck more too\n[laughter] All right do you that I mean that's really my question because right now we're at a baby ... baby step number six\nHere's the thing we do three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nKnow why because it's so much\nHis neighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return meanwhile the rest of the nation dripped way down and his up twenty percent\nI I I agree with you I this is why I'm calling in because I'm trying to decide if we should continue their rent this out no and wait until okay\nNo it's a bad investment it's a bad neighborhood I don't know what's wrong here but I mean a ... a house you pay three and fifty thousand dollars for in two thousand freaking six before the crash it goes down and it's not even recovered back to three fifty\nAnd I mean that's a very unusual real estate market unusually bad and I don't want to invest in it and going forward and so I wouldn't keep it going forward take your take your loss and get out you bought in a really bad place for some reason I don't know what's wrong but that's the worst numbers I've heard not on a whim\nI mean everywhere else just about as recover Florida went down the Knicks went down freaking Las Vegas crashed and has recovered\nYou know I mean but there's some you know there's some parts of Detroit that habit but those are economic pockets but it's not an overall national economy thing and so you don't buy in bad economic\nPockets yeah and you don't keep in bad economic pockets and so out of there I'm Out of there

twenty thousand sell it and yeah you don't make thirty five thousand dollars a year driving toward that was our car that didn't work\nYou're got too much tied up and things going down in value and you got a four hundred and fifty dollar car payment don't you\nThink it's almost like I've done this before [noise] yep yep that's killing you it is not a blessing is it kind of the car it's not a blessing and it's been naturally killing you it owns you you work for this car\nYour part time job that you took is because of this car it's\nNot worth it sell the car and then work your way through the debt and then you'll be debt free in about a year year and a half max and then and you know including the car that you buy that is very very cheap that you like five thousand dollar car that you pay cash for or you pay it off very very quickly with your other debts but\nI mean you ... if you want but I don't love the score it's a stupid car and it's killing you your numbers are horrendous on this um\nIf you have more than half of your income tied up in cars or things with motors in them all total to then you have too much of your life taught up and things that are going down in value and you're always going to struggle\nIt's causing you to be middle class or lower middle class socio economically speaking financially speaking and it's all because of a choice of what you're choosing to drive\nI Would not choose to drive that I Would rather be wealthy and drive whatever I Want later Dr like no one else later you can drive like no one else get your life back\nThis thing on the issue

generosity you'll be able to do you're going to run into people that need help and you'll be able to just do not think about it right um 'cause nobody owns you now that's it and you're no longer a slave to the lender is right that's a pretty impressive stuff gosh wow\nVery cool so what do you tell people that key to getting out of debt is\nA that's a that's a great question um one thing I can say is you have to be committed a once you agree to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are Mm\nSo once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream a and and there's many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at the nice houses and say you know when we do this right we can go pick a house and we can do that ... ... what we want you to do it right\nYou know I hadn't thought about that sharing and I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and then go you know someday we could do that and here's all we gotta we gotta do this this and this and then we can get there\nAnd it wasn't like oh we'll never get their roll our eyes open or those bigger people rich people were more like I'm going to be one of you and you know and that's what you do when you drop it and read them all live here that they don't live in that one you know just as bad\nYou know right and that's a good I'd forgotten we did that too\nBecause it gets it gets down inside of you then doesn't it doesn't it does and then you could sell stupid right that you know and get your whatever you have the boat and get you on lighter man goes back\nTo live like nobody else later you can live and give like no one else 'cause you're not giving up

I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] so ah what do you make\n[laughter] right now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated [laughter] okay and family is in Los Angeles [noise] okay and um do you have children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce has going ahead or not\nIt will be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do when you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed and Sharon not filed except that she had sons of the papers or she got the file to [noise] but um and we had to follow on all the different corporations mellow sees that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago [noise]\nUm so uh in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan in\nMind okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your eastern one either way whose name of the credit cards in\nBaltimore\nEvenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them were he to file and you not file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name is the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on him and he has run out of there\nSo it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nUh Fifteen in ten ... okay\nThe rule on a an asset that has um\nThat that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student loan back that's done okay the corners then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you're telling me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and that and like sort of the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or is a um\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard so which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten or Fifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea\n[noise] I'd say about ten\nOkay All right and so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that [noise] and then you got the other car now in the event of a divorced what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it [noise]\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least watch out on it\nAnd say about that\nOkay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay see him so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In a veterinarian method and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working full time\nAre you a D. V. M no\nOh no I'm attack your attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it yeah okay\nAnd you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the car debt if he walks on all of it\nOkay now if he chooses not to file and fly through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be\nWhat does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about ah twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nNo he's still in his share in the military [laughter]\nYeah do I have no security clearance you understand that he understands what I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo amazed chances are moving\nUp in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy but he doesn't make any money in and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind as I was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] I'm so sorry thank\nYou know he's just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to heaven yeah yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh yours too okay I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay is this is making sense to you here\nSo I'm Sorry your face and all this what a mess listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you very much I\nThink you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up with a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh [noise]\nYou know they had and I'm kinda borderline whether or not to get a term life term [noise] a wife to kids at home and I'm\nThe premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts [noise] and do I still go for it even if it's you know three four hundred dollar a month premium um three or four months for how much coverage for um ten times my my pay million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nUh we basically that'd be ...\nYou know how to get you okay are you are you overweight\nYeah regret I had to give me too [laughter] yeah\nOkay yeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the white down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good\nGood for you to hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and buy a smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nAnd um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so you already knew these things right um yeah [noise]\nUh but but I mean what if you took half that\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nUh two eighty [laughter] what does she does she work outside the home now she works out of ...\nNow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in the pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million is not offer\nLucy before that [noise]\n\n\nYou're

it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only\nThat right and it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their lives\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and man I feel so much better and I'm On the way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say now you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ... what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control and they got it or that Debbie Downer writer party thing right the\nMartyr thing now and people do that all the time and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go I think you can I really ... 'cause I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can win\nAnd being held dead and they do ... you\nNo no no they're so you're already you already jumped to the front lawn you got slammed down as you start saying that and that conversation is she gonna shut you down ghetto they are and all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you know not for her just get\nAbout ... like when you're alcoholics and obviously you wouldn't know allow for and drink ... John Barr knowing what I get married when I got very money\nTo drink\nRights and my parents they're basically eating out ... times a day\nFor all that time and my dad that threat tired and they only have one income that are living on to encounter yeah\nAnd and so when we meant that they don't live in our in our state and so we go visit them G and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner and he showed that he loved that and we love hearing a lot but I just want to scream absolutely not to say that our kids and that I don't want to train our relationship\nIt just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go that you only take us at the age or two broke that stupid\nIf you want to see that that's what you're thinking\nAnd I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you\nBack you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but you're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not ... and you know of course that only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and\nYou know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went broke we killed each other I Know how it feels to fight\nAbout money and um we don't fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk

why should we believe awarded this you don't have to be a cynic like I Am you don't have to be skeptical of authority like I Am to even follow the logic to understand what I'm saying it's all suspicious\nIt doesn't make sense to me the whole thing is I don't like it\nI don't like it at all that's simple tomorrow they're going to blame it on Trump somehow that will be suckers next move\nThey'll say that they were analyzed by people in the FBI they can trust uh worked for Obama and they found small tiny little fingerprints on the bombs and there were traces of dyed orange hair on some of them and therefore they're pretty sure the president had done it that's tomorrow\nWithin twenty minutes we'll split so one of the worst propaganda is in the history of the media was blaming the president\nSo look I'm using my native cynicism intelligence skepticism\nI was raised to you know I think for myself I don't believe this I just don't believe in I don't believe it's now it's more than they did someone up and throw him to the wolves they could get a NATO says he did it and maybe he did maybe they set some that have somewhere to do it but what's in those bombs [noise]\nSomeone

who put the bomb in his uh in his mailbox come on crazy I don't believe this not for a minute but I don't know maybe a year you buy it to me it looks like a hash tag thing they're going to have already\nThe only people who are real losers here are the Instagram slots\nLike those Justin Bieber in in bikini types who every day they have to show them in a in a bikini like we never saw a woman before so tomorrow they'll have to appear and say oh my God how do I stay in the Instagram I have to show I received one too\nBut we all know that we don't want this to be real we're all glad that if this is a a ploy\nBut if you missed the opening to the show you're not going to miss one about the tide you again because I think I Hope I'm wrong\nI'm rarely are on the left is going to find out that this failed as well the left is going to find out that even the left the skeptical of this little game that the writers even more cynical of them middle ground says I had enough of the left wing with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen as they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they are libel actual send wants to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine where kill that's I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it\nWe don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monger and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it isn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately I have been trying to tell America for a long time now that there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace\nPhase of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace they only know hatred of war\nBut I saw pictures of the illegals coming over with a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age and and clean the clothing that semi headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say what can I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor your gangbangers so what can he do so we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump\nAnd so far with thanking God that it wasn't Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is surging toward the border\nThis is his Alamo\nAnd if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you left referred to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was and as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon\nIn in order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were when they go into signing the NAFTA deal with them because they're that horses out of the bond as they say and American parlance so how we going to stop these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you but you want a little tiny history about\nWhen Rome was broken into by the vandals individual God's when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find that offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men barbarians how do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them\nWhy do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right to snow killers know gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical\nSo let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand\nA small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races\nSo why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you are in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have the deranged walking the streets\nBut I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which were called their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know where I go to the whole story now go get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire into into east and west ... as I describe in stock mass hysteria and as a described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening very important for you to hear the ... the empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating morally and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd again it's just what happened next\nWell all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies without pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals and what was once that Syria and is now Romania\nLive is a Godzilla west Scott's behind those in South Russia where the east guts or ... and beyond those\nIn the vulgar region where the lands and then they were the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself let's go to graduate\nAnd then they were the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nLet's go to graduate school together in thought for a minute\nWho do you blame how about both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on them on the illegal aliens for the last twenty five to Thirty years they'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing\nWhy do you think Trump won the election because we want something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't\nSo you could blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties and we're asking that Honduras Guatemala El Salvador empty the prisons and then not houses because if you look at the pictures that are so plain and the picture is worth ten thousand words\nNow young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for a fact\nSo that Jake Tapper can a Yankee or guilt chain and Wolf Blitzer can\nChime in and say hey that's racist\nBut we all know what this is it's an invasion\nSo what's an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying it because the current or it I mean I read existential isn't my ...\nAnd as a a girlfriend so I Know ... as if it's a wonderful phrase it's an existential threat was originally used the here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago and he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this is a true a truly an existential threat to our bought his language and culture so the question is why is nothing being done I don't see anything done\nNothing wrong to the next subject

showing up at a variety of places around the country and of course the theories abound that everyone's got a very I mean there are only a couple of aspects here you know that this was a a a\nTrump supporter that's sending these pipe bombs suspicious packages to Democrats that are are supportive of\nDemocratic liberal causes and very anti Trump and outspoken against Trump you know that's one of the theories that oh it's it's clearly a Republican it's clearly a conservative or somebody that's pro Trump was\nI wanted to jump to conclusions of this point is in in Brazil do not jump to conclusions I'm pretty confident they're going to figure out who it is the other possibility that people are floating around is that it's a full ... it's actually\nA\nLiberal it's actually a progressive Democrat\nSupportive of the Democrats and die from sending these devices to Democrats to make it look like\nIf somebody why do I make America great again read the hat wearing Trump supporter was who the heck knows and of course you get very little rations in between\nUs we're going to go the phones here in just a bit we'll open up a whole I'm sure we'll get a flood of well I I've got an idea which way the falls are going to go but I just imploring everyone do not jump to conclusions there should be enough clues here\nThere's certainly enough with all these packages at least the ones that have been found\nAnd I'll go over the list of we're packages of God there'd been some interesting uh circumstances in turn of events on packages that we're supposed to go somewhere else and it's it's really an interesting story that's unfolding let me be very clear there is absolutely\nNo place in this country for this activity I don't care who is responsible again it might be somebody a political just trying to stir up a whole bunch of crap that's another possibility here\nThere was a report that Eric Holder got a suspicious package and Debbie Wasserman Schultz not a suspicious package here's the deal\nYeah the package was addressed Hey Eric holder\nBut the package was attempted to be delivered to Eric Holder the address was not a good address and it was return to the sender\nAnd whoever this little joker is that's doing these pipe bombs and packages they put Debbie Wasserman Schultz is sunrise Florida congressional office as the return address to suggest that Debbie Wasserman Schultz sent the package they're called but no that wasn't the case\nSo the package goes back was that little added little joke kind of like the blues brothers and ah they gave the address of of ah Wrigley Field that you know at what what uh ten sixty west ... whatever\nThat is a little joke kind of like the blues brothers and ah they gave the address of of ah Wrigley Field that you know at ... west ... whatever it was that the whole deal here with the the Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address so that gets return because it was on deliverable to the Eric Holder address\nAnd then it goes back to Washington shows that there was a report that Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York on a package that is not the case apparently was just some of 'em are meeting a package with a

determine what it is as a result it will take some time until we know more about the safety of the building I'll continue to keep you all posted as you know\nOr as we know anything more about the timing\nI Want to commend the all of our colleagues in New York in particular and elsewhere who have helped keep us on the air as this crisis has unfolded I'm really proud of all these thank you so that's where I'm Jeff Zucker who are the Trump is not a fan of ... not a fan of Trump but again\nYou know to suggest\nThat the White House press secretary and the president and words matter than to continue the tax on the media that\nThis that it ... it was a Trump you know calling out and calling CNN fake news that that was the cause of the getting the package no that doesn't make sense George Soros kind of package that Clinton was got a package Obama got a package\nA package was addressed to but they got returned to the bogus return address a you know Eric Holder was supposed to get a package but it got returns to the bogus return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida\nSo I mean this was in a meeting just wasn't on the president rags on CNN so look CNN got an anthrax or you know ... on blow up with a pipe bomb inside as well or they come on or whatever the powder is it's going to be something in their crap cross to get what they read and went back and so I'm sure it's tested negative\nBut I've been to make a claim that you and again I Wish cropper back in town I don't like Trump calling the media the enemy that people I don't think they are\n[noise] [noise] uh

I'm fine thank you for taking my call Todd\nAnd uh you know I'm not a choppers pencil in a box\nOr a a bomb not done that may um where I come from is not really a bomb and particularly way you got about eight or six or eight or ten or twelve of them that's like a scene from a Hollywood movie okay\nBut uh I'm not going to I'm not going to go as far as one of your previous callers went\nBecause God I got some gaps in in the whole situation that you're gotta fill with facts so I'm not gonna I think he was from California a couple of callers by\nRight and ah they got some gaps in and I'm not

address meaning it belonged to Debbie Wasserman Schultz a former head of the DNC and\nA Obama ac ally and Obamacare ACA light and certainly a boogie woman on the ah on on the left or\nAs as a call now from folks on the rights and the return address was more of a a gag and I waited until like uh the the address for the the the blues brothers for a you know the the the Wrigley Field address and the blues brothers movie that it was very Wasserman Schultz is\nAddress as the return address on these packages and as far as the last of the nation and\nI'd like to hear from federal investigators I'm
