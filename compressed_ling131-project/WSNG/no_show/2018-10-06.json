they check it out and find out it's folds or the the election will be over and there's no way to undo it that's wrong so tell me about what you did with young people do try and find out of college kids find out their point of view on all this [noise]\n[noise] yeah well okay that's clearly a lot of opposition to to Kavanaugh on on the left right no question about it and\nYou you you know the stories can continue to come out that cabinet I did this and we went from you know he was a conservative they don't like 'em to ah here's a gang rape and spray like here to sixty yep so I Want to see what those two parts to it and the first not wanting to find out what to what what they believe what\nIdiocy can I make up their so obviously falls\nTo see if they would believe they're public in Canada for any office only the Supreme Court would believe so I began with with something I said you know [noise] a cabinet during the hearings\nKey he felt that we needed to take a black man's value to be worth three fits the white man's value late but one of the most ridiculous things you could possibly imagine right now they're going to laugh myself out of here a little to hold a every single person I approached believed\nThat he said a black person is worth three fifths of a white person\nYou know by the way reminds everybody where the three fifths figure actually come from an American history\nIt's called the three fits compromise and what happened was when there was the faith in the south in the north to for to figure out on a census basis\nHow many people you know what would what was the the ... how many people were in the north from the south of the country's a hole there were there was an agreement to count black people's three physical white person because\nIt was actually the north who pushed that because they didn't want the south and say well you know their slaves we want to count them as citizens therefore we'll have more people than the ... how they came to sleep is compromise\nYeah so it it has a reference in American history but it goes back a long long way there were actually college kids who believe that the the Kavanaugh are held to the position that the black citizens were only three fifths of a person\n... every single person and then I Want to see if I could talk myself\nSo then I said well he also wants to take 'cause listen everybody is concerned that he is so dangerous to women's rights when you hear that all the time is absolutely dangerous to women's right so I wanted to see okay let's see how far they go to believe how how big a danger he wasn't even though he said that he thought that little versus Wade was\nSupreme Court precedent and they wouldn't take that away they still didn't believe him and he was a danger to women's rights in general\nI said okay let me see how far we can take that and I said well did you know that he wanted to take a woman's right to vote away of course nobody believed that Lawrence well except that they all believe that and not a single person push back and they all use it as an example they say why the terrible person\nThat's insane and these are not high school kids these are college age kids so they finished K through ... education they'd been admitted to an American college they're supposed to be smart enough to study in college some of the people you talked to had a year or two in college and they still thought crazy things like that\nThat's right that's how much they're arrangement syndrome about Republicans in general are are that how significant the situation is because they still want to believe that no matter what that how their way and they are how how brainwashed they are when it comes to American and to what they think Republicans stand for\nWell and and against the really frightening thing for me is that these people who consume mass media if they turn on CNN and\nAnd our MSNBC or read the New York times or the Washington Post ah they will see stories\nThat some of us said that hogwash I can show you\nThe documents that show you the thing that you just read in the Washington Post isn't true even NBC or got caught exaggerating some of what a Christine forward to had to say to Congress and they were called on it but if you don't know to call somebody on it or to go out and look it up\nI did and the thing that really bothered me was that he didn't answer the questions about well he didn't answer hardly any questions but ah\nWell can I tell you why that might be true and it might change your mind maybe if you go to if you go to any judge anywhere in America and you say judge I really hate drunk drivers one of them killed my mom so I have a reason personally to hate drunk drivers\nIf you get a drunk driver in front of him and you got to be in front of you are you going to throw the book at him that judge if he or she is a response will judge will say I am not going to tell you ahead of you\nKnow not recuse they're not going to prejudged your case so for instance if you ever saw a judge publically come out and say every time there's an issue of land rights which comes up in court frequently around America I'm always going to decide on behalf\nOf the landowner instead of the local government that may say they want to do something with a land if you say every time a case comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker\nThat judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me judges should never take a position that pre judge is a kind of case so for example when you add net\nWhich almost all of them in this case from the Democratic party who say your honor do you take that roe versus Wade is establish law and you're not going to challenge it well the thing is that is a pre judging a case that may come before the court\nIf you say your honor a if a if a man is suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation\nHe should immediately refused and say I won't answer that because the minute you prejudged case you're not a good judge anymore now almost all the things that the Democrats asked judge Kavanaugh about work questions like that\nSaying tell us promises that you won't overturn roe v way and they didn't say in those terms with it\nJudge Kavanaugh about work questions like that\nSaying tell us promises that you won't overturn roe v way and they didn't say in those terms but they were trying to get him to take positions on things that almost guaranteed will come before the Supreme Court at some point in the next thirty or forty years and they wanted him to announce a head of time\nThat he would take a position on cases but he hasn't he been heard yet now we don't want judges like that and I just explained why does that explain why he had to give non answers to most of those questions because no judge\nShould take a position on a case ahead of time not even your local judges in your town or county should take a position I had taught now does that make sense to\nOh yes you're you're a master debater but uh I have been a master ... is I bet you are but uh the the the question is why are all those ... look close and ah\nWhy why there's one word he won a secret word answers your question the word is abortion\nLots it boldly a during that that uh that session getting his testimony and so that that is why people say he does not have the ...\nWill hold on and I even dealing with somebody ... accused you of trying to rape a woman if somebody falsely accused you of that would you have the kind of mild tone of voice that you have with me right now when you got dragged up in front of national\nTelevision cameras and told proved to us that you didn't try to rape that girl thirty six years ago so you've got an accusation\nThat if people take it seriously and decide that you did this a third of a century ago\nYour career goes away you're spot on the Supreme Court goes away your job is an appeals court judge go goes way and likely\nYour entire law practice goes away you will never be employed as a lawyer you will never be employed as a judge if you are facing that kind of threat based on a false accusation what would your response\nWould you be angry I I was new to me I Would certainly be against it yes but uh how come how Harvard you're what you're talking about is not a re invited him back the teachers that are not\nThe ... and now you've got something wrong and I'm going to correct you on it\nJudge Kavanaugh three days ago sent a letter to Harvard He usually goes there and teaches constitutional law every year and he informed them I Am not going to be available to teach constitutional law\nHe's going to be on the Supreme Court he doesn't have\nTime to go teach college class at this point most of them do not I don't know of a single one of the justices the teachers even at the local D.C colleges or universities how in the world with a guy who's sitting on the U.S Supreme Court have the time\nTo go all the way up up to uh up to Harvard and teaches constitutional law class he wasn't just invited he sent them the letter now I'm Glad I get a chance to straighten things out a\nLetter up a sent them the ladder\nAnd all you know there were people at Harvard who said we don't want him here now if you think that influenced his choice it may have\nBut he's the one who decided I'm not working there and he won't have the time because after tomorrow about twenty four hours from now judge Kavanaugh

I'll take it is\nFull of some very strange questions and you're right there is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the result but you put forward the example of Pete Domenici first\nUh end of the idea that he came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh did degenerative disease or at the wasting away the frontal in temporal lobes and he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on\nBut it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps\nSuggested to the member of Congress are centered or that they uh they really don't have any business doing the job anymore [noise]\nYeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another\nThat they uh they really don't have any business doing the job anymore [noise]\n[noise] yeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that\nA Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and a arguably he really should have resigned a retired when this verity of that was discovered\nAnd think about where we would have been today with the cats and North Korea confirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bad in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote a that's a practical example of debilitate Asian uh that\nReally arguably should have dictated a resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken in whether somebody's in town or out of town and that sort of thing I suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a\nHouse and signed the mortgage documents and you know signed them electronically or send them you know over wire scanned them and then send them back that are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have\nTo be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense\nIf say you know that there's a senator from Montana\nOr Danes who is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then\nQuickly fly back to D.C to cast a ballot\nShould we at some point consider maybe the idea of allowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district to their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists and Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and uh\nThere are ways to definitively verify that it is that person loading and you could do it in a book by something like sky so that you're the ... a a the counter could actually see that the person was casting as well yeah it was a little\nYou know it's funny doctor I don't know if you were Henry and I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there was a case I Know about recently a ... among some friends or acquaintances where somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer check and\nI said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer and they said well they have a device attached to your smartphone and you have to actually\nLook at the camera and be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube showing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple test you know per week\nTo assure that you've not gone back to the bottle and I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator ... smartphone\nA show his retinas to the camera phone my my phone will do that it'll confirm who you are by right now it will confirm who you are by fingerprint you could do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast their vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere\nAnd they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\n... absolutely technology can do that with a with the great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test or ... yeah\nIn the article a I had links to a couple of hundred videos of her speaking and\nShe's not as she doesn't seem to be affected all the time but there have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word and that\nIs what I Would consider way outside the downs as of normal uh ability to express herself\nSo um we're we're going to have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she used to posed as a majority leader as a leader of the Thames in the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well ... ... on the\nContent item that\nI don't wish or ill but if somebody is not fully capable in politics no one wants to be removed from the spot no one is likely to want to remove themselves their own party isn't likely to want to remove them\nGal loved to have her on the court it'll bring out the anti papers the laugh I'm so that sounds great but on the other hand I kind of thing Trump should appoint a man I don't know what man but some may on because we've seen the left\nAnd so that sounds great but on the other hand I kind of think Trump should appoint a man I don't know what man but some man look as we've seen ... now any man they nominate we that are Republican nominates and as we were going to be accused of rape or you're going to drag out a bunch of lunatics\nThey'll bring out and Julie sweating again and ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind working evil they do mind working implausible\nBy the way you should do that in colder results when an attorney in a very climbing a\nLaw degree is the court for important people or Justice Thomas in all let me ask you a legal question I don't do that very often but you see in the wall Street Journal reporter I imagine that says that Leland Kaiser the longtime friend of\nOf a Christian Ford says that she was leaned on by people she told the FBI that she was leaned on to change your story from I wasn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it through apparently to a story that said she was going to back\nUp Christine forwarded which would be I think if if it's possible more than one eighty or from I don't know anything to I remember the incident is\nIs that a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to influence somebody to lie to the FBI\nAnd hence to Congress in a process like this where is that just something that's just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nI looked up to the federal budget on that but it is certainly a crime to uh try to get someone to perjure themselves and quite closely related to tune perjury\nWell it was on ... I assigned a\nAssigned oath statement yeah absolutely as a crime if it was just in talking to Senate Democrats I'm not saying it under oath um possibly could day\nI'm speaking to a government official the FBI agents but yeah it absolutely nation and they got the prosecutor I Am so sick of Republicans and this is one of the wonderful things have gone out of trunk is showing showing Republicans how fun it is to attack\nBack for once but Republicans always want to be the gun spores that oh okay\nWe want in the end we got we got cabin on\nThe court no no no no no a statement has to be made this will never happen again you will not for someone like this and will destroy his life like that\nI couldn't agree more who don't know what should we you said don't trot out somebody else but let's say that a ruby introduced Berg leaves the court in the next two years before the under this term and I anticipate a second term because of everything good that's going on um what can we do proactive way\nTo shame the Democrats I Know they have no shame but what can we do to shame them to say don't try this again because private cute prosecute\nProduct you prosecute I Want to know who leaked the

he dropped his pants and presented his private to Debbie Ramirez at Yale University if you believe that he participated in high school age gang rape parties she'll buy alcohol and pharmaceutical drugs\nIf you believe all that he is not a good man\nSo Murkowski believes he's a good man okay then what's wrong with him she also says he's fine judge\nOkay she sees a fine judge so if he's a good man and a fine judge\nThen what's the problem she says well he's just not the right man for the job\nWell you look at his history you look at is legal resume you look at his history of decisions and all this makes no sense what she's saying but she's got to try to explain that somehow as far as I'm concerned I Hope the people of Alaska understand they could\nWhat she's saying but she's got to try

right person to represent the state of Alaska and now she's showing it because she says she's going to vote no tomorrow on a judge who is qualified she calls him a fine judge\nHe's a good man she says which means he's not a sexual criminal or a gang rape is for somebody who had drug his fellow high school classmates or to be able to obtain sexual favors if all those things are true and Murkowski

he's battling the growing problem of child sex rings in America\n... good to have you on a thank you so much for your service for America\nWhile it was a pleasure and I appreciate you having me on last night I lose it's always my pleasure to have you here but so tell me about a veterans for child rescue\nWhile it's a nonprofit organization that I founded a with my\nMy daughter essentially my daughter last\nYear in March of two thousand Seventeen was abducted at night point and brutally sexually assaulted for hours and Tucson, Arizona and ... a month later in April we officially found at veterans for child rescued to try to make sure that that didn't happen to do other ... and\nI I was learning already\nThat there was a there was a widespread problem with child trafficking in the United states in ... uh but I've got a lot of contact and colleagues that that could really help me be instrumental in fighting this problem but rather than\nAddress it as a kinetic problem like law enforcement might adopt a I could be a better health alerting the populace\nTo it and the best tool to do that\nTo shake the American people awaken in and\nLet everybody know hey this is what's happening to our kids are is a documentary so we began filming a documentary and uh\nWe've got Eighteen months of filming now coast to coast at the Southeast Asia down on the U.S border we've been running sting operations with federal and local law enforcement interviewing different witnesses and surviving victims of family and uh all aspects\nOf the people of crisis really just tried to empower the American people with the knowledge of what's happening to the kids with child trafficking because it is estimated that at one hundred and fifty billion dollar industry there is an estimated ... million children being bought and sold\nIs it is estimated that at one hundred and fifty billion dollar industry there's an estimated five million children being bought and sold\nAs merchandise right now on the sex trade and that's something that's not okay with me so that's what's that's for ... rescue this it's an alert piece to to alert the American populace to empower us against it so that culturally\nWe can put that the bed and a stand up against\nTogether Greg done so horrific that inspiration for what happened I have to ask how is your daughter doing\nWell she's tough she's she's a fighter it was a horrifically um impactful against her obviously she had just turned Eighteen at the time and uh I'll I'll share one little snippet\nI mean I'm not as you to go beyond you know I mean I I don't want to dig too much but I mean we want to know how your daughter's doing so\nYeah but on a positive uh she has served as a junior college aged with us on a on a very large and powerful joins sting operation and she's been instrumental in helping put away several pedophiles child predators and she has stood there and watch them getting handcuffed him put away\nSo that was very empowering for her and she said you know pop up that was more healing\nThan any amount of counseling or anything else could have ever been so she's a fighter she's going to be okay and I think she's going to be an inspiration there to help the others you know Craig us just kind of how she is wired\nI think that's something we ought to find a way I have\nSome acquaintances and co workers who've who've been sexually assaulted\nAnd everyone reacts differently I Know women who don't ever want it mentioned again I Know women who will tell you exactly what happened you know because they believe that I think it helps give them some catharsis so people should not assume that when when someone has been the victim of a sexual assault that they that everyone reacts\nAnd saying that they they don't want to talk about it in some cases they do a and and being you know hearing the story and all that helps them out as you said it did for\nFor your daughter many women and girls might not have had the strength to do with your daughter did to to live through that to recover from it and then to go out and help catch the bad guys uh that's that's an incredible show strengthened and I can't say enough good things about a young lady willing to do that\nWell you're right we do all relapse react to\nThings differently and sometimes that the timing issue sometimes or somebody may hibernate a bet with the with the pain and want to be quiet about it and then later in life there like you know what I'm not okay be silent anymore now it's time to speak out so uh whenever whenever I\nI support anybody's method of dealing with it I mean I wouldn't want I wouldn't wish on anybody and I think that's why I'm so passionate about fighting it and just and turning our culture against it you know back in the Nineteen fifties there is a man named Alfred Kennedy that falsified a bunch of sexual studies to make it sound like a\nPedophilia and child rape was somehow okay and he softened our laws to soften our psychological system and soft and on your educational system to the failure and fast forward three generations later we've got an epidemic of child rape and\nI don't want that to happen to anybody so I think what we've got to do now is turning the culture back against that which has proven to be so harmful to children whose lungs are not yet fully developed they cannot advocate\nFor themselves against a fully grown creditor and we've got to defend the defenseless we've got to rally around\nOur children and and defend them against uh these these harmful adult predators\nI'm Talking to ... a former special operators sniper for Navy SEAL team one and a founder of veterans for child rescue [noise]\nWhat do you hope to show in the documentary to to bring attention to some part of this from were not aware of because we know there was a child sex trafficking or you know practice in this country and we'd like to shut it down and it seems amazing that a country like this has had such a tough time getting a handle on this\nWell it's a global problem and and for some reason it seems like it's being suppressed in the mainstream news media they won't tell us what's going on with it it it is the fastest\nGrowing criminal enterprise on earth so why are we the citizens not in the old buried deliberately and very specifically what's going on so to answer your question what I what I intend to share with the American people is that which they need to know\nTo fight this epidemic that's happening\nTo our children that they're not otherwise be told literally just to walk the American people through the truth whatever that may be to show the different aspects of what is really going on with the kids so that we the citizens can understand the nature of the threat and and effectively defend our children\nReally going on with the kids so that we the citizens can understand the nature of this or that ... and and effectively to send our children accordingly\nYou know Craig ... I don't know whether you agree with is above like do you get your take on it I see an awful lot of so called homeless people on the street now some of them are there for mental problems from other for drug problems but I get the feeling that when a young man\nOr woman or a young child who's under Eighteen says I'm leaving my parents' house sometimes are leaving because of bad things that have happened sometimes are leaving 'cause they don't like mom and dad's rules and when they started living on the streets it seems like that is the prime opportunity for these traffickers\nTo get a hold of them and and uh and get a hold on them and and and start to prostitute done and that that seems like something we could take care of if we stop making the assumption that well if you don't want to live with mom and dad are ...\n... you know then you can go out and live on the streets and a lot of cities like it or not aid and abet people and living on the streets and they get in a way of returning those children either to their original household\nOr to a foster family but not tolerate them simply living in probably the most vulnerable spot they live in on the streets without adultery from\nA very astute observation you're absolutely right there are predators waiting\nFor young waterways waiting for the boys and girls and think that that your son or daughter can go one way in the middle of night and go to a bus or or or or place to catch a cab or or or homeless people hang out and not\nAnd if we have a sensible immigration policy we should be able to see wages go up shoveling\n[noise] yeah I think that's right so there's ... there's there's three groups I think of people that we that we should think about one is people with a criminal record you know ... and ... we're worried to hire those areas and I ended up millions of of of America's with federal records has a\nBunch of those I think have struggled to find\nWork those are slowly I think\nAre being brought it back into the labor force then there are people who've been unemployed for a long period of time\nThat's still over a million people the people have been unemployed for more than half a year hopefully those boats going out by ... and then there's the last group and I think that's the debate where where the social thing than comic play more of that the people who haven't been looking into a bit out of the labor force or for a\nFor quite a while or that that was about a million people and um I we can bring all those people back and then I think they'll have a hard situation really is that it\nHas been in the last fifty years or you know I think right now the late nineties still look pretty good you know that have higher labor force that station so not only ... days at the everyone was trying to fight we can get back to that then I'll be fully says\nYeah we'll stay in the limited throwing\nIdea ... I was down in Dallas texas a couple of years ago to two new broadcast one of our stations and I saw a company that was advertising its services construction company but I\nThink they called themselves conned structure and they had a clever name and and on the rest of the banner they had on the side of a building it made it clear they would hire ex cons they would hire people with criminal records and why\nWell because you know while there may be some additional steps you have to take to make sure that if you hire somebody with a criminal record that your tools aren't going to disappear but once you've\nUh you know I've talked to plenty of callers to my show who said I have a crack a felony record and I tell all my employers when I first go to work for him or when I first interview I have this record I'm beyond it I've I've I've\nCorrupted my behavior and I'm going to be a great employee for you and instead we have government's trying to ban you know even asking\nAbout criminal record I almost wish we could encourage people if you're gonna go straight and you're going to straighten out your behavior then we're we're happy to have you tell us that so as an employer you can take advantage\nOf the skills that come with that person who may be a very good worker wants to get past that but I don't want the government doing and I want\nA private employer and maybe somebody who says I'm going to start a construction company and I'm going to hire these people and I'm going to put 'em to work and I'm going to expect performance and I'm an expected they don't go back to criminal behavior but other than that I'll pay him a good wage\nBecause then you've got access to a a whole crowd of people who may not be be accessed\nRight now by conventional employers who just screen you out of the beginning that makes sense\nNow than they settled since we started to see a little bit of that for example Wal Mart which of course as a you know the the largest employer\nOf them all and I get the million and a half and believes in the U.S that they've started you know trying to target a or B records a little more in their recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll all work out [noise]\nAt the target or victim it'll records a little more in their recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll work out [noise]\nSo where do we go from here how low can go before the wages just start rising because employers find they can't get anybody to work for them if they don't ... you know bumped the wages up\nWell I I think first we'll we'll we'll see if we can absorb those additional maybe two three million people once that happened I I think you'd start with the wage growth as long as you know of course the economy\nHas to keep growing right so if we if we suddenly in a recession we wouldn't see it but you know given all the fiscal stimulus we've had from the from the tax cuts to\nThe increase in spending I think the next couple of years we should we should really start to see some wage growth at least ... in the long run you know wages only keep increasing it we you know we develop new technologies of build new factories and better equipment and things like that though\nYou know ultimately that's where we're at a wage growth is that is going\nTo have to come from and that requires of innovation to continue and people want to do that with the fact that\nWell we got a break and it's like ... on that\nNote you mentioned the tax cuts is not just income taxes it's instant expensing or rapid expensive equipment so it used to be if you bought a a new big piece of equipment to expand your capabilities the company's new excavator anew bulldozer or a new machine at your factory you had\nTo take the tax savings on it over ten or Fifteen or

Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe the accuser that the the uh\nThe uh defended has no rights at all the defendant does automate\nThe accuser that the the the defendant has no\nRights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist\nYes that's not the mindset of somebody who believes in the American constitution and the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fascist\n... well and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back\nIt up with specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist no wonder is exact words and what does he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump and\nYou know they started on that\nUh and now they moved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand that I think that this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump and enough people hate the Trump where it's stuck for a while and then they decided to move on from Trump\nAnd they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we've said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus\nAnd allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else who more people look at and say well this is somebody who we really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics used against Trump\nThat might have been okay for some people because they despised him so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realize oh no that can hit him that it can hit him oh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn\nWith the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times\nBecause if it's their political narrative but it is the mind which are seen is the mindset of a fascist and the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not just ...\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti\nFascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condense from those two words there the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought\nThey're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who

all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been crossed I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the

know we started out way back when and you know who knows where the industry was going to go and now it's so popular and mainstream\n[noise] it is and uh you know regarding immunity you know people are suffering colds and flus I I'm myself them are getting over one right now\nAnd you know one of the problems is so many of us are unrestricted diets I've seen figures that somewhere between twenty and twenty five percent of the American population is on some kind of restricted diet whether it's paleo Quito or a vegetarian or\n... or kosher or a gluten free there's so many of these variations but whenever you're on a restricted diet\nYou restricting your ability to get certain nutrients are the some of the classic ones are are vegetarians with vitamin D twelve or omega three fats or\nOr you have the people and the Quito diet you might not be getting all the nutrients they should or restricting carbs or or fats or things like that so ... uh with that in mind we're not necessarily getting all the nutrients we need to be fully functional and to be able to resist these challenges\nEspecially during seasonal changes in times when we're moving indoors and exposed to more people\nYou know so Neal you know that there's been a lot of blowback against supplementation lately in fact you know some a media reports that say well multi vitamins they're really you know we used was a kid can you respond to that a critique because you know many conventional doctors are now taking that attack\nYeah but that's that's really a myth that you can get all the nutrients you need from a healthy diet without limitation because the food tables that were built by the U.S department of agriculture in Nineteen forty our way out of date they don't reflect the current food supply or the way that people are choosing their foods\nOr the way foods are process today and so they're kind of imaginary numbers that I mean imagine that we're getting everything we need from our diet if we'd ideal diet with all the options that were choosing not to eat a lot of foods\nAnd the\nNeed for bridging those gaps there's nothing better than a supplement than a lot of negative reports are saying that dietary supplements and multi vitamins especially do not prevent cancer or heart disease in short term studies\nThese are not short term developing issues and people don't take multi vitamins to prevent cancer and heart disease they take them to bridge nutritional gaps which is a logical sensible thing to do\nWhat what are some of the star and nutrients when it comes to a immune support and and I'm thinking particularly you know people who are uh you know maybe they have medical\nThe star and nutrients when it comes to a immune support and and I'm thinking particularly you know people who are uh you know maybe they have medical conditions maybe they're on medications winter interfere with nutrients but also you know older adults who were you know it's a big deal when somebody whose Seventy five gets a cold or flu it can really knock him back\nIt is and the first thing I Would always recommend is a multi vitamin because you get vitamin a vitamin D you get vitamin C. vitamin e they all have roles and immunity you have minerals like selenium and think that have rolled in immunity\nSo if you get the basics then you know you're not deficient and the body has resources to have defenses against these illnesses we've known for over a hundred years for example that vitamin a deficiency make measles more aggressive\nAnd there's more recent research showing that viruses react to a lack of nutrients in the body\nAnd become more aggressive they can even mutate in that body and become more virulent so or the ability to resist depends largely on nutritional confidence\nThey need now taking an example of that might be a selenium where they found in the part of China where he was they were selenium deficient that the C. V. virus which the interests of serious virus but usually recover from it or if you're nutritionally confident or they can result in in just a horrible cardio my office the\nWhat can we do to realize the vision of one nation under God indivisible liberty and justice for all the ... president of staying staying true to America's national desk city I have a suggestion which I Believe is essential for the future of our country do away with the hyphenated identity\nNo more Irish American Italian American Hispanic American African\nAmerican et cetera put America and unity first are American of Irish descent\nItalian descent Asian descent I\nAm an American of African descent we'll all Americans first a common culture in heritage we might like to visit her ancestral home\nBut we don't want to live there our ancestors came on different ships but we'll all in the same boat now time for every citizen of the United states to say I am at American\nWBRC am WBRC F.

kind of a two part question about sixteen Seventeen years ago I was diagnosed with um thyroid problems I think it was I I always think button anyway I'm over time my uh the amount\nA pig I went to one twelve now the ... he is or whatever it's called\nElla Rock Center since road yeah mhm\nYeah now there's just wondering uh I just recently retired my insurance before paid for ... and now that I'm not on that or and now my insurance or pay that the more I'm a liberal by rocks and ... is is there any difference than that I mean\nYou know so there's there's that's actually interesting questions you know first of all let's clarify the difference between natural thyroid and synthetic spy read your taking the synthetic thyroid\nOr which is fine for many people are however I find that some people don't do as well on it as on the natural pirates of the natural pirate goes by ... different names or use Roy to armored thyroid\nA natural desiccated pirate but you know it sounds like you're doing okay on the synthetic virus which is either generic ... or brand name since rent so little background on that\nIs that the makers of since Freud a undertook a study years ago to try and prove that their brand name since Freud\nWas superior to the generics because I Would offer these are obviously offer them a competitive advantage I mean their product is more expensive and why would you want to take something more expensive\nIf um it wasn't better so the study of basically demonstrated that they were equivalent that health Roxanne generic was equivalent to since Freud\nAnd there was kind of a scandal because they tried to bury the study and the author of this study are actually came out it was kind of a whistle blower they they told her up to the study was done okay you know that's very nice go home\nLike you were doing the study and they tried to suppress the results are so ah however that being said some people do appear to notice the difference when they switch from central delta rocks and often doctors say well you know we're gonna save somebody will put you on the generic\nPatients don't just feel the same it's different strokes for different folks are the difference is in the delivery system\nThe amount of medication in a generic is always the same\nBut the tablet they may be different and for some people\nYou should in a generic is always the same\nBut the tablet he may be different and for some people the way they digester absorb the medication the medication may hit them all at once or it may be released in a slower fashion depending on the matrix in which the medications delivered that's what the differences between a brand in a generic\nAnd uh it makes a difference in how they feel cause thyroid if released all at once can give you kind of a rocket ship trip and then drop your back down and wants to wears off and he wanted to be kind of gently time released into your system I think personally that it doesn't make that much of a difference when it comes to this particular product\nDifferent situation when you deal sometimes with psychiatric drugs some people say well I Do great with a lecture pros that is the brand name but there's you know the generic or doesn't do the same for me I always feel altogether different\nThat can make a difference as I said\nDifferent strokes for different folks great question Jay stay well thanks for calling

zero nine nine zero zero speaking Iran Syria's let's get on overload solve the Julian Cyprus\nCalifornia's would kick open the garage doors this hour Julie welcome to the car Dr automated and how can I help\nWhen you were involved I have a question about our jeep wrangler really caught okay we were involved in an accident on September first ... after Ninety six days I'm twenty four thousand dollars worth of repairs we've got the car back whoa and\nIdaho and it really didn't look that bad but because my husband tried to avoid her and went up on two wheels kind of caught the end a carriage so the whole brain\nWheels that kind of costs enter carriage so the whole frame was replaced and of course everything else that goes along with that and about Fifteen hundred miles after we had the car back\nThe right I'm Sorry the driver site front tire had a very bizarre wear pattern so we took it back to the body shop and he said I'm the car was put back together correctly it's a jeep tire issue\nWhich of course it wasn't an after four months of me running around this suspension is off in eight spot due to where it how it was put back together and the alignment is way off and he's still refuses to fix that set aside his problem\nOkay so let me let me back up a second how many miles of half the destructive on at the time of the accident at the comedy I could've had sixty four hundred six thousand four hundred miles that's correct it was ten months old I had sixty four hundred miles and obviously this repair was performed through your insurance company\n[noise] through the insurance company if a person that fault\nOkay so you know the only thing I Can't comment though 'cause it's California in New Jersey um doesn't matter whose body shop those it they're they're just as responsible as if it was your worst\nNow you know the arguments becomes the ... give us questions did it go directly through their insurance or did your insurance pay for it and then they went after the other person directly through their shrimp or\nShow have you talk to your insurance company about ...\nI have but they say because I\nTurned it over to the other insurance company they're out of it so he suggested my agent suggested I go get it fixed myself and then try to read to my losses so I don't I haven't taken it yet but what I've been told\nIs it's it's a relatively minor thing to redo the suspension probably about twenty five hundred dollars okay so my question to you that the Carson City since March about march fifteenth and we haven't driven it other than taking it to places that haven't looked at is it safe to drive until I have the time and money to fix it or should I not driving it until I got a\nWell when they say it's often eight different places what do they what do they mean by the visit so they is it workman ship is it is a is a you know the quality of port ... what do they mean by that\nSo I have this print out where they put it on a machine and gave you gave me the degree of what it is in all these different spots where the suspension or the cars to the frame I guess right and an eight of them as many as Fifteen degree is a tough one side of the car is higher than the other by approximately three quarters of an inch\nOkay so it sounds like this is poor workman shipping according to Richard have been put back together credits that is what it sounds like just from your description but I just don't get your insurance company's obligation isn't it isn't it isn't that their responsibility to arbitrator on your behalf\nWell that's what I said and he said if I had given it to them to begin with and not gone straight to the other company they would have repaired and fought with the other company but since I took them out of the equation which I didn't realize I was doing\nOnce I took them out of the equation they no longer have any say in it and the other insurance company says we fixed that we paid him if he didn't do it right that's on him not a U.S we paid\nTo have a retired so now you're stuck in the sport where everybody's passing the book exactly um do you have a war you can talk to like a ...\nI Do and I've been talking to them and so um you know now that we're where I went through the bar every everybody the bureau automotive repair came out of course he kept telling me his findings but he told me be sure\nThat I get the report and have my attorney do whatever they have to do to get\nIt he said you need to see this so I Believe that he keeps telling me that there was a problem with the repair so I'll probably have to fix it and then go after him either ... or in small claims depends on what it is that's what all the other insurance company hasn't paid the whole claim yet either because I always go after them why about it but\nBecause they don't want to pay any more money they didn't pay rental car they don't pay anything like that\nSo I Need to go after them to collect that money you know and it's still without a car that we can't drive\nWho ... who had the your husband your whose fault was the accident\nIt was the other party they made a U turn from the curb over a double double yellow and it was so close to him going down the street he didn't even see it until she was right in front of him\nKnow never mind will just take care of it and it was like it was like dude [laughter] there's nothing wrong with the vehicle changes the oil and move on there you know I just called it\nAnd it was like it was like dude [laughter] there's nothing wrong with the vehicle changes the oil and move on\nYeah you know that
