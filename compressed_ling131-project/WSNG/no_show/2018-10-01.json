middle class there are typical clients but we do do it for people who are younger to\nHow often how often do you go you're out there all the time\nThat we're giving seminars on living trust improper state planning really every month\nIn fact I was at the seminars just this last Saturday given by the heart for current I think they called them prime or prime event seminal yes it was written rocky hill yeah and I gave to just there so we're a big believer in educating people about what they need to do in case they die or become mentally disabled\nAnd not just having things happen and then disasters occur\nSo as a public service we will go around to all all of these various places\nSpeak about the seminar so that's a big thing that I Do in particular we think that you really don't know what to do until you first get educated so we've always been a big believer in that\nNow again you get about forty don't you that's what you like\nForty is very typical and it is what we like because we find when we have more than that\nThen we really can't go ahead and talk too much to the audience and I just love doing that so we try to talk to the audience\nAnd um are able to then have a question and answer period how long will get a hold and collect question answer last a long time I better you know it it always surprises me just how many questions people have 'cause you you give the seminary anything could cover everything but there's always things that people want to ask that you don't cover\nSo I'm question answer will typically last twenty to thirty minutes\nOkay my friends now here are the seminars okay\nFirst stop ... stop ... cancer cans at\nTen AM to twelve noon and uh this is a a going to be well there'll be forty\nThere'll be forty a community center in the ... and

best things we have at our company is once you do a living trust with us you become sort of a member of our extended family\nSo we do a lot of stuff for you just to support and there's no charge for

of the time to act is right now there's no time to delay we have to get this done and\nLet's be honest veterans have earned that they deserve this they should get the benefit\nAnd we want veterans to be aware and widows and what orders a veterans are also eligible for this program that's why we want folks to come and hear all about the program explain everything to them they can meet with me for free they can attend the seminar for free and\nAgain it's twenty six\nThousand dollars per year tax free\nTo help defray the cost of home care assisted living or nursing home care home care any one of them any one of them and it's it's a wonderful program and again if you're a widow or widower a veteran you are also eligible it the only criteria is here has to be a war time veteran but you didn't have to be in the actual war theater\nYou could have been here in the states during\nWorld War two Korea Vietnam or any of the ah Gulf conflicts that something that's a it's a wonderful program we want to make sure that everyone is aware of this before the law changes\nNow let me ask you just what's probably a stupid question why do they wait so long why do they I mean we got the you know we're going to have the time I Know we will write a but why do why do they do this\nWell crazy things happen as we know I in Washington and uh the the concern is how'd you find out about well I'm involved in a lot of different uh veterans' organizations and uh I'm involved with the elder law attorney or throughout the state the or the national Academy of alternative I served on their board\nUh so we're plugged into what's going on but it's unfortunate that the general public is not is not aware of this and that's why we're trying to spread the word we're going to do as many seminars made as many people as we need to between now and the Eighteenth so we're getting up early and we're staying up late and\nGet it well our value or something I'll tell you when I walked in here this morning a very very early and I saw your name on the on the chart\nAnd I said to me sell myself right away I said it's got to be something naturally it's veterans that says so on the other she here but he's got to have something that he's got to get done soon because that's the way he operates and he doesn't quit so that's why you're here well this\nIs not an issue that's near and dear to my heart and the son of a a a colonel who sends past\nAh I'm here today with a very good friend of our from bill ... who's a Vietnam veteran who I brought here with me today were incredibly proud of him and he's an example of someone\nYou know if you you've you've earned his benefit and we want to make sure that all veterans out there are getting this information we'd be happy to go out and speak to any veterans groups like the house or to to explain this to we got to get the information out and we've got to help our veterans\nAnd again the telephone number telephone number of my friends that you should call

but we always take the hill remember that [noise] five or six zero five eight three one two three four one\nAnd a again this is you know something this is a fabulous deal for a ... well they look they've earned it oh I Know but it does it's ill\nIt could be the difference Brad between\nWhen he people to be aware of it that's why we're spreading the word we know all the wonderful things that you do for veterans here in the state and we appreciate that and we thought that this will be the best way to get the word out throughout the state and uh get these benefits to where they belong to the veterans\nNow of when they come in what what happens just just give us a little bit\nWell what we want to say is it's very important that the family members have the duty to fourteen which is a discharge papers if you don't have 'em don't worry about it there's ways in which we can get that that just to show your dates of service or to show that you're you're qualified\nOr from there we would need to know a little bit about the health history that are there certain activities of daily living that you can't do it but don't worry about that again you can plan now and if you need this program a year or two or three from now you will be grandfathered in under the much more favorable laws which is what we want to help families with\nAnd we will go a little bit about what their finances are 'cause there are income and asked the guidelines but believe me there are a lot of people say well I don't qualify I have too much believe me there's ways in which legally ethically you can become eligible for this program\n... ... said well I can tell you this every time\nEvery time that you did the program with me\nOkay it was always in a situation I went out to your ... you know we operate from right it's always your situation however uh there are many many veterans and you know it as well as I knew it that would have never ever ever got any one of these programs if it didn't\nStay the way that you set this thing up and you know that it always happens like this one of the things that the ah the military has got to straighten out though they really really do that not just a spring it on people because it's tough on these guys it really is\nYou know we have the same problems at the at the south park in the same power\nProblem with making sure that they get what they need\nWell once we get through this battle we're going to make sure that we're very concerned about what's going to happen after the elections and and and caught and veterans' benefits and believe me we're going to be keeping an eye on that and I'm going to be keeping you advise brat and we're gonna make sure that that doesn't happen also\nWell that's a that's just a just terrific so

the house\nTo what is your household income\nHousehold income growth is um about a hundred and forty two\nAnd how much does out on the phone to fifty okay right\nThen you really are in seven years

probably each other in our family knew it was a good idea um but they didn't understand when we went back to family troops um we told him it wasn't in the budget and you know they didn't believe you\nKnow it's a strange concept to you know pay cash for everything and a lot of people don't really understand but\nThrough all of this our marriage has become so strong we worked together we've achieved something I think it's pretty incredible\nUm and I think we were each other's biggest cheerleader I mean people supported us and thought it was a good idea but a lot of people you know they don't want to talk about money or they think it's kind of strange and it said it is a foreign concept so I'd say we were each other for this year leaders\nDo what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is if they are\nHolding herself accountable mhm um I don't think anyone likes to do their spouse no but um you know when it comes to money either have it or you don't you can afford it or you can um so if you just keep it simple it's it's easy to do\n... and I'd say paying attention to your money I'm prior to learning about you we just bought whatever we want we didn't pay attention if

for you about a whole life insurance policy [noise] my wife has a whole like her\nWell they have um I got a question for you about a whole life insurance policy [noise]\nMy wife has a whole life insurance policy that her parents got for her you know twenty some years ago and they have they're done hang it and now they're transferring ownership over to us or we're wondering if that would be a wise thing to maybe a cash that out yes or [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] I'm wearing babysat too so I didn't know um if they'd be wise to catch it out orders to let it grow\nNo it's not growing but about one percent a year\nOne point two percent is the average cash value growth and shown Ireland so it's sucks as an investment it sucks as an insurance product\nSo are you you should get I uh ten to twelve times a year income on you tend to twelve times her income on her in term life insurance Fifteen to twenty year level term\nAnd then cash this stuff out and use the cash value towards your baby step\nToo often [laughter] um we already have the term life insurance in place for both of us so good to toss chimes our income you know they're just calm and it would be it would take about their care of the rest of our debt which is about Thirteen thousand and the cash value right now about Seventeen great every taxes with it\nNo probably not the basis in your whole life policy for tax purposes calculation is your ... as if what you paid for it is the total that her parents paid in over all those years which is probably a whole lot more than Seventeen thousand\nOh okay\nAnd yeah it was as long as that's the case there is no gain nicely paid in Fifteen thousand it's a total of all the premiums they ever paid was Fifteen thousand and you pull out Seventeen the game would be two thousand\nGotcha yeah that\nIs actually the ordinary income is not again because it's not actually an investment\nSo are but um yeah I Ninety eight percent of all live policy particularly these horrible childhood policies like those when I Do not you don't even get back what you put in it that's how bad the rate of return as you see what I'm saying it's that have been the actual fun to be a hundred thousand it's those I haven't seen\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nHonor is with us in Orlando\nHow are you [noise] I'm good how are you days better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUh the question was um how much do you think young people say Eighteen to twenty three\nShed um prioritize investing and starting early relative to kind of piling cash for a first time\nUm I think you can do both um there there's no rush to buy their first home I'm\nGenerally speaking from Eighteen to twenty five there's a lot of transition in your life or there's a lot of moving around um things that happen new jobs a finishing are going to college possibly getting married a lot of stuff happens and that Eighteen to twenty five range\nAnd so and every one of those things may precipitate living in a different place\nAnd so like if you bought a house at Eighteen and let's just you know I don't know your situation but let's just pretend you then uh or or Nineteen and then you finished college and got married there's a real high percentage chance that house and cutting it you're moving somewhere else so you probably should have just rent it during that time\nUh and piled up cash so it's not a rushed into things kind of subtle out in your life and you know what the groove is now you can settle in the groove and Eighteen that's fine you say I graduated I Know what I'm doing this is what I'm doing and\nThere's not going to be any big changes going forward um then that's fine\nBut um you know a ... if you are in college one hundred percent I Want you to focus on college not on saving for our house and not on investing because the best right of return is education assuming you're studying jumping the Jews are born in the marketplace\nI'm not getting a degree and left handed puppetry or something like that so but yeah that's the best return 'cause you're make more money on that than you do on our mutual fund or on purchasing a house and so but it all depends on your situation the more stable and predictable the less transition that is in Europe\nPurchasing a house and so but it all depends on your situation the more stable and predictable the less transition that is in your future\nThe more you would lean towards may be buying a house but I'm just not in a hurry there I Love real estate I Want you to own real estate real estate's a good place to have money it's a good thing to own to have a part of your life going forward\nBut um but it's it's not necessary or that you get in a hurry on it to just just to you know just to say on a house\nAnthony is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Anthony welcome to the day Ramsey show\nOh Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm well I'm twenty two and I'm starting a air conditioning company and I wanted to know if I should\nWe get a vehicle east or um by a van for say thirty five hundred or whatever I could afford it by cash or what should I Do\n... ... if you want to win in business you don't borrow money\nAnd that would include leasing okay housing is just another way of financing something if you Lisa copier you financed your copier if you Lisa van you financed your van to what you did you

entrepreneur man to win this thing off on your own you in the van and getting it done and yet their way to go man have you been working in the heating and air business for a while\nYes there and my dad on the ... so I've been working with him quite a while\nOkay and so it's just going to be you in the van and start off\n... ... where are you going to get your customers\nA I'm hoping and the next couple of months I've been going to school in a fit my contractors who I think though I'm I'm just at the beginning stages\nOkay but I mean where are you at what kind of marketing or you're going to

about it and pay cash for it\nGot ya okay\nBut always be thinking this is a business transaction this is not a ... purchase and so you know I've never walked into a guy's office and because he had a twelve thousand dollar desk in his office I did a deal with him\nI guess you have ever\nNot once as a matter of fact I might not do a deal with them because of that right but I've never walked in there and so people all the time by things in business that they just personally want to own and they rationalize it and go well it helps me with my credibility\nHorse crap does not your credibility

over\nThe world over for decades and decades on trade and it's just unfair tariffs et cetera so uh this is a much better framework an outline and of course the ... the prince through there was held and then the the questions that we're taking a the original\nQuestioning which Trump wanted was about this new NAFTA deal or there's this new replacement a proposal and then\nOf course everyone wants to talk Kavanaugh which are you a breath and I I Want to talk capital too and it was just interesting watching President Trump I kind of your jockey and and suppressed and and the no not now will will take those questions later on and you know some are making a big deal out of that\nThat was I understand he said hey let's deal with this not the situation now and\nThen we'll deal with Kavanaugh a little later on and when he did that actually delivered us [laughter]\nAh that\nThat delivered us a whole lot of great material\n[laughter] and\nAnd here we are I I got this the great audio by which

broader than when he was ... it was a\nLot of your whole body page will get to calls in just a bit on ... eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine you know as I look at the progress or what we as soon as the progress\nOr from the FBI as a they're investigating as they're interviewing and it appears we have a board obviously a we've got that the ... mirrors accusations I and we have an update on that he does not appear the FBI scene\nThe sweat Nick tree at this point so\nYou know where I think ultimately this could end up uh and it appears that you've got all these you know he said she said you have the names provided by Dr Ford from this party back in the summer of eighty two allegedly\nAnd the names of the again for provided they don't recall the incident even this so called close friend\nOf Dr Ford this a legal in Kaiser and she doesn't even recall the events but has said well I don't doubt her but I don't recall the ... well that's pretty significant let me tell you what I think this is headed\nAnd you know we're hearing about these uh we get started last week there was a new name that's emerged over get into this just a bit there's another Yale classmate that is talking about Kavanaugh and his drinking habits are at Yale and\nIf I were to guess at this point\nI think this investigation it's not going to find anything of an assault or sexual love attack a situation if anything it sounds like this might be heading down the path\nOf the Kavanaugh misrepresent his drinking habits in high school and in\nCollege and hail but then again you're dealing with a he said she said or he said he said well actually it'd be both because I've seen a woman come out talking about a ... drinking habits claiming that he was not fruitful and then we have another not only this this roommate\nUh not not only ... number one but there's another name that's emerged over the weekend where a another individual and we'll get into this is claiming the Kavanaugh was not truthful so again the question is\nIf he issued exemplary service and judicial intellect in the three hundred seven opinions that he's written the the many more than he joined the majority on\nA deal hold drinking habits in high school and college do you hold that against someone in their adult life\nI mean people do there is an immaturity what what do they say about the male brain\nI I don't remember exactly but but it's something like the male brain does not fully developed until the mid to late twenties like out of the twenty I've read studies on this it's like twenty six or twenty seven years old somewhere that ballpark that the male brain does not\nActually a fully formed Italy's in the handling of decision making 'em you know if if someone in the part of the brain and to to put this in layman's terms that the male brain it's it's mid\nTwenties or so or a little later a as a point where the male brain really has come to grips with what's right what's wrong and making the right decision\nAnd I look back at some of the stupid decisions that I made my friends made in in high school nothing approaching these allegations but there was a there was a van incidents on Shore Drive and Virginia Beach a circa Nineteen eighty two which [laughter]\nSame timeframe but you know what I'm a great recall them and told my story ... hang on back in a minute Shia\n\nNow but it takes a lot to get excited about it back\nBut most ... twenty percent of parts of excess or that's twenty percent off prefers twenty percent off officers twenty percent or ... anything you can fit inside the ... hotel your buddies there is a bag they just have to check out all the parts ... people\nAnd of course uh as I discuss the ad nauseam at this point and a lot of people disagree with me and it's like you know I took a lot of calls on this on Fridays program folks with out the agreement\nA it was it was Thursday and friday with without the agreement that uh\nActually it was friday it was friday because of the uh the vote a and\nAnd we spend a lot of time on this on friday and I said with out to this concession that Kavanaugh would be toast and\nI I I got into an argument with a couple of callers because it just comes down to the mathematics that with out vis FBI investigation is if you want to call it a confession without this cabin all would have been toes so I had a couple of people call the show does I gosh man you're caving in you're giving him they just need to\nPart of yeah OK ramming bulldozer vote you're not going to have\nEnough votes in the full Senate well first of all flights probably without this compromise for the week long FBI investigation flights\nWould have been a no so flank was the answer to get Kavanaugh addict committee and of course totally split the eleven yes on the Republican side to know exactly what we expected whatever or whatever the circumstances whether that's really the way this cookie was going to crumble ... flight said\nWithout the FBI investigation or that he'd be a no vote\nObviously and with\nA voting for this to get out of committee that that flake would would if nothing turns up here the flake would be a yes vote or when it comes down to the full Senate vote for confirmation but the issue is you would have lost Susan Collins you would have lost Murkowski the a lower level of\nDemocrats potentially a\nThat would vote for cabinet you would've lost them so you wouldn't have had those votes the Joe mansions or the Heidi Heitkamp you would not Donnelly you would not have had\nThose votes to take up the slack of losing flake losing columns losing Murkowski on the Republican side so anyone that wants to just you know as you talk radio feeder and rhetoric\nOh they should have held their ground they should've voter right then and then that that is great you can play the game you want but when it comes down to what you want to see Kavanaugh confirmed and\nHe would not have had the votes is simple mathematics\nHere it doesn't get any easier than this oh Smith where's your back for someone to call up and so you're you're all wrong sniff they need to vote and get get capital what don't you get they would not have had the votes that is the point I'm trying to make\nSo I I even label flank as the potential savior and this is where against\nPolitically interesting that it turns out the flight with this demand\nAnd it looks like that he came to the ... with a Collins over on on the um or or or um uh ... his ... democratic friends a I'm a ... a Kooning was his name as a ... on on a\nCoons crispy foods are so it looks like all he was Chris Coons a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee the fact is you could look if you look to you like he\nWas a caving in and he's a\nFlake is really the closet Democrats the fact is is that by by striking this deal with Chris who's over on the Democratic side this ultimately could be the saving grace for Brett Kavanaugh because otherwise you would have been complete toast back to square one\nA new nominee for the Supreme Court for President Trump\nSo candidate on might be saved by this flakes and ultimately there's this Chris who is he's a senator from Delaware on the Senate Judiciary in that little a ploy that we saw\nOn friday so I mean I don't know why people don't understand that this was the only shot give me another way\nThat this potentially could have gone\nThere is not there is not\n[noise] ah let's grab a couple of phone calls here and then I Want to get a little deeper into the investigation and what we know so far uh regarding Ramirez doctor for the center of the Democrats demanding a I Believe is a list\nOf a couple of dozen additional uh interviewee is that the Democrats want to see the FBI interviews so we'll see a back to the phones here are held by Diane and Ontario, California Dianne your first stop today on Schnell welcome to the program\nYes Hi I'm I've been watching this um whatever the current trial but the point I Would like to make that link Kaiser\nOr not and now ... ... and what not ever at a party with ... with or without ... the economic group we need my concern with their front vi investigation\nAnd that somebody ah regarding the unnamed boy kind of come out of the woodwork and say you remember everything that may not turn out well for ... and the old saying goes even allowed to whereas when good men do not\nDiana I think that the looming Kaiser story I think that carries a lot of weight yes uh you know she is on the fence here because she's saying that she didn't know Kavanaugh did not recall this party which uh I agree yeah this is is is very very significant but then she says well\nAnd ah Christine ... or ... for a new back that I guess he was Christine Blasey you know for her to say uh that it has no recollection but I don't doubt it uh those to me are very contradictory as you can imagine how does the word\n... thanks for the call appreciate it let's go to Maryland and author is in Maryland on Iran Schmidt welcome to the program\nWell thank you so I just want to say thank you know I Love listening to your program\nUm and I had been listening for the last hour and I just think you're right spot on everything he said however I don't know how the Democrats could do this this gentleman is kind of intelligent\nJudge how could they do is to his family and how ruined his life\nRight they don't because they don't care if it's all about what they care\nBecause come on and on it's a ... by the way do you like your honor or is it Anna\nAnna then okay I I Know I Know some of the pronounce it ... ... yes\nAs you and you've been around a while I guess and somebody should understand that for the Democrats here it's all about preventing Kavanaugh's preventing this Trump pick its prevent it's ... it's taking the the Kennedy's swing vote and putting it into the hands\nOf a reliable conservative vote not a swing\nAnd that's what the Democrats have vowed at\nAll costs to stop this Trump nomination and they will ruin lives they don't care so for you to say Amazon not yelling you you're just trying to I'm just trying to get it on a rafting leader they are and\nAnd they'll they'll do whatever it takes they don't care who they step on with golf cleats they don't care who they smash\nThey don't care what limbs get torn from the tour so it's all about stopping Kavanaugh\nFrom confirmation that's all the Democrats care about and they said so from the beginning you have like I said the likes of not only

like men to approaching late twenties I Want to say they're twenty six twenty seven twenty eight then that's popped up in in what I read and\nYou know just to suggest that you know at at parties were drinking was involved I don't believe these I don't I don't I don't believe the sexual assault stories regarding capital it just doesn't reconcile now as far as drinking and not making good decisions well drinking I I understand and\nI was trying to relate a story where\nI was sixteen years old and I made a really really crappy decision a grant did this has nothing to do with the sexual assault

angel it seems back\nIn Nineteen eighty eight and prior wall they weren't college now that has been retweeted thirty four thousand times it's been commented on Seventeen thousand times it has been like fifty eight thousand times\nAnd then as I screw up and I look at these other tweets from this D.C McAllister\n\nI Want to know about Christine high school and college years we've unpack capitals from high school and college how 'bout hers have characters on the line in his he said she said circus let's expose every ones and there are she tweets a lot there's DC McAllister\nAgain I I Can't even read all these tweets just asking questions if someone who was a UNC at the same time she went first a difficulty uh college just want to know if she engaged in any questionable behavior while they're\nBrent her turn so this woman is going after Dr fork and then she was questioned about\nUh you know the woman or a woman can party drink a lot hook up with whoever she wants to be sexually assaulted you absolute dumb ass that was somebody responding to her tweet she responds\nAbsolutely not absolutely but character and temperament matter when it comes to the truth especially with no evidence rights or no and again I scroll through a tweet that there are there's like since since that tweet on Saturday there's like a hundred tweets\nOn here I mean I don't know how she has this much time to tweet us ... as a writer I guess uh\nIf anything happened to Ford and that's a big if it seems it's more likely to happen in college with no cabin on not in high school so she's suggesting\nA threat from a friend of mine professor Cleveland\nAnd this professor at Cleveland let me see if I can figure out what a conservative Catholic law Kurt twenty five years seven circuit judge or an adjunct professor Notre Dame lawyer CPA so here's Margot Cleveland a friend of this this D.C McAllister\nAnd she tweeted let me ask you something of a woman came forward and said that she was sexually assaulted in the summer of Nineteen eighty two and she was Fifteen by one boy with a second in the room anger on and to corroborate her claim she pointed to small portions of notes from therapists and\nThen you know she goes on a\nAnd continues her tweet in multiple tweets but the point is again a lot of women are doubting the story here a lot of women and again I'm scrolling now like dozens of additional points here from this this D.C McAllister she's a contributing writer to PJ Media\nOr the federalist a coauthor is Spygate and she has a whole vase apparently of Charlotte North Carolina she she's a columnist would paint Jamie\nWhich uh you know I think the Jamie does a very conservative website easily noticed pajamas media is not PJ Media and I I think they do a very good job and I've read their material for years so you know here we have another example\nOf a a woman that's calling out Dr Ford I were an eight hundred and again I'd love to hear from the opposing view I mean we take all calls it has been nearly impossible to get a woman to call this program\nThat thinks that that Kavanaugh is the devil and that\nThis Dr Ford is telling the absolute truth it has been nearly impossible for me to get phone calls in support of Dr Ford\nOr in the fact that it was cabin on Kavanaugh is the absolute devil\nOr as some of the women that are called and said yeah we think something happened but it wasn't ...\nIf you'd like to jump on folks it's eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine than nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine so we have the loving to an affair ... situation who the heck is this\nWell it's Chad\nCaddell ordering to and it turns out that a guy that attempt at Yale University here's this is a different man than the roommate of Kavanaugh's apparently there was some bad blood there there was a it might have been they might have been a in a in a in a triple a with three roommates\nAnd\nYou have cabinet whose alluded to the fact that that one of the accuses uh that we talked about last week that oh he wasn't truthful with his drinking that he was sloppy drunk he drank a lot he was belligerent so we've heard this now from a a woman she was on CNN we've heard it from the the first roommate and now we have this Chad loving to\nAnd this is from an interview with the New York times\nSo this guy who was at Yale with Brett Kavanaugh\nHe spoke to the New York times on Sunday and he is accusing Kavanaugh of not being truthful about his alcohol usage his drinking\n\nAs it was discussed at the Senate Judiciary committee hearing on Thursday so it's ... gave an interview to the New York times and he said that he saw Kavanaugh staggering from alcohol\nConsumption on multiple occasions\nHim as again belligerent and aggressive now this is to my knowledge or at least that this is what I write for like there are three people now from Gail days that are calling him\n[noise] have language you know being used the same with three and that does that sound a little\nContrived as it sounds a little too in concert that to me of Dutch all using the same as exact language here\nIt is true that is at stake he says is calling from New York Times it is true that is at stake and I believe the ability to speak the truth even when it does not reflect well upon oneself is a paramount quality we seek in our nation's most powerful judges\nThat was a statement according to the New York times\nNow they also do point out and good for the times that this loving ten has made the\nPolitical contributions contributions to Democrats over the years they categorize these donations as small in in uh in stature I you know I\nI don't see the actual number here but that he's made some small political donations to Democrats over the years learning seven Kavanaugh\nWhen he watched the hearing on Thursday that he seemed to downplay his drinking and the quote degree and frequency of his alcohol consumption that's what he told the touch and that the FBI has asked him to share his story\nAt the FBI bureau headquarters a field office in Raleigh North Carolina so loving Tim\nApparently is going to speak with the FBI oh he is going to be a apparently one of the ones interviewed a regarding\nThis this drinking so if he if he's correct to he told the times that he's supposed to ... a share his story with the FBI in Raleigh today\nIn ... in Raleigh North Carolina so it might have already happened it might be occurring right now\nAnd then of course we have these other classmates that have also come out and said that oh he's a he's not telling the truth about his drinking and again I just find a lot of this attack just completely suspect then again\nI mean these individuals' must have known about his rise his time in the Bush administration in multiple positions in including handling some of the most sensitive material\nBefore George W. Bush\n[noise] it it can be a it just doesn't make sense and then we have this this woman that I saw on CNN she was you know talking about his drinking as well\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number here on that that's how you get on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine now from the President Trump presser from earlier today\nThis was in the rose garden this was essentially dealing with the new deal\nOr regarding the agreement we've come to trade with Canada and of course the Mexico arrangements so the president earlier today and the rose garden of course this all morphed into the cabinet discussion to me the best audio bite to merge\nI have ... up and I want to play for your next now\nI also in our number one I played the audio bite of Trump saying\nThat hey on the Democratic side uh he was alluding to\nOr somebody with big problems with alcohol or a sloppy drunk on the Democratic side and of course that got tons wagging who the hell is he talking about or listen Trump good she could just be throwing out a a bogus or you know a a buggy Frisbee out there for a while to chase which is certainly a possibility but this audio by this is this is the best", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Torrington", "day": "01"}
