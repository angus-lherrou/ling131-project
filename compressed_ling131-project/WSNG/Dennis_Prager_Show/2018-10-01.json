is currently and I'm Mary McNamara\nBefore we get to all the developments uh in the FBI a rubber just an additional background check it's not an investigation it's very important to say that because there are differences between an investigation and a background check so we'll get to that coming up here in just a little bit now Democrats have been\nMoving the goalposts to on this the one I loved yesterday well he might have perjured himself what the amount of drinking in high school really\n[noise]\nThat's that's what you've got the old days are where are you going to measure the amount of drinking in high school yet so we'll we'll get to that here in a little bit a couple of things\nThat we didn't get a lot of chance to talk about the economic things last week and and so with the the announcement the day that that a new United States Canada and\nMexico trade deal has been done and were stating that because no longer is it North American in the United states Canada and Mexico right name has been changed [laughter]\nAh the aid of a couple of economic indicators\nAre you know the month of July was was horrible I mean it was the the highest and five months for trade a deficits soybeans killed us or not being able to sell soybeans a ... Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the story being lost that we have had and civilian aircraft got hit a real big in in in July\nOf last week economic indicators coming out that big you know because of the tariffs\nUh that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half\nAgo that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get the trade imbalance down\nBut the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president has had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro\nBut you know ... ... and they're telling him you cannot have these kinds of massive\nTariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and China it's going to kill your economic growth\nIf you wish to be president in twenty twenty you've got to reverse course got you've got to come up with a a a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nAnd so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last\nSecond [noise] knowing the administration knowing that look Congress was not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's\nGone and nothing replaces [noise] going into the going into the midterms and then\n... uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you've just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe [noise] you've got advisors to the president saying you can't do this did you go to\nA Christian or was the one they say that was one that that got everybody to come down\n... ... ... was the one where I read that to them like a really well\nI mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deals so you're left with nothing [noise] or you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you could call it a win win\nOr you get this winning playing you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you can call it a win which if you're selling more it's it's not less\nWell look we so we ... we said this already met\nThere you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can't stop it you can I can stop your ... you can isolate yourself from that you can stop it it's impossible\nBut when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita were day if you look at the trade going back ... back back and forth across the border\nAnd it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico and then when it good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states and the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four times\nAnd ... we were suddenly Mexico to begin with a per capita that's their population for every dollar they ... that you know they tend to watch we sent them three dollars they're smaller country they've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada as like what one eight\nOf the population in the United states and we were\n... uh selling them\nFor every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person in the United states have Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars over the last couple of years per capita\nIs what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible ... oh there's no way you'll ever get there now\n[noise] I don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states wanting to be close no so uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know start leaking out\nHopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for ... here's your forecast\nWe're gonna pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today\nWill continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana\nOr\nA flight in fact announced that he was going to vote yes all of a sudden he gets cornered in an elevator\nThis is the difference between um\nA well this is exactly what ... what really got us here was the idea of putting all of this on television and the first place because now the left feels empowered to be able to change the landscape by screaming by shouting at you\nAnd they will be thanks to Jeff Flake\nThey they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting him\nThen that elevator was all over social media on friday this is why we go direct\nGoing direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that were ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president\nThey don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to come by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win in November So he decided not to run\nThen he of course has been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially a a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump you got to be an agreement for that disdain with them they don't care\n'cause you're still the bad guy so he goes in and he\nFor that disdain with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy so he goes in and he of course decides he's going to hold up to vote\nI'll I'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it on the broad vote well\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well so now you have the background check\nNot in this is not an investigation no one does not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews it is\nThey've done several already they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope well this is only about ... the accusations but it does include the re mirrors accusations\nNot just the Ford accusations right so now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to in by the way we could have done this July thirtieth with a Ford accusations\nAnd you got what the FBI going and doing interviews\nThey will not make the decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate that's how the all of this is going to work so you delayed it by\nA week or\nIf you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere new start screaming perjury while the house isn't gonna bring up perjury charges\nPerjury for what exactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it you see the problem with the for the allegation is that you cannot they they\nIt's in it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said oh but he lied about his drinking\nRight oh yeah right\n[laughter] I'll just how is that I\nYou know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nAnd in high school he writes very still like spear right in your because you would have to get down and he said he never order he never said he ... he never he said he never blacked out\nRight now but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... but you might have you know but\nBut how do you [laughter] but he is not perjury or you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I don't I don't understand\nWell what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president\nBecause I don't know I remember a bronco bomb on the and and\nUh and\nHim smoking pot in the story of him smoking pot and I paid Arnold is but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know the ... but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell\nThen this is and then you got to push back of course on Sunday\nFrom a Lindsey Graham and and others\nAre where it was you know look this guy is not a stumbling drunk but the centrally goes back to label ... labeling him Kavanaugh as such from high school well gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton\nWith with ah with Rocco Palmer and others oh it only matters as if he's if he leans right if he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never you're never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the goalpost were first on friday a and part of Saturday it was he's too partisan or because of his reaction attacking the Democrat\nAsked the data that they that he was that that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot serve he doesn't have he he doesn't have it takes because he's two part well the part that turned into because then the the uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty uh a sixteen where she said\nOf that um\nUh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty uh a sixteen where she said uh that I'm\nA\nShe calls Trump fake ... she's getting involved in politics you should be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals ... he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you well written and in one story\nA because there was no promise a that he\nCould he could a ...\nHe could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me you've got Sotomayor on tape on record saying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\n...\n[noise] the whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan\nAt the president nominated\nNow there would still be objections they must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] if Trump he must be up to something I mean he could have nominated mirror burning ... oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland a nice the wrong choice I mean it it it would have been\nSomething some kind of objection [noise]\nBut for the media is that there's no promise that Kavanaugh\nWould leave is biased aside right and I was you what\nFirst of all that they still don't get it right but then they dropped that ... they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger it wasn't that it was directed that because once the Ginsburg thing came out of the women Ginsburg's been political all the time and then they had to drop that\nThen they went to the next thing they moved the goalposts again which is his temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as a petition or the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um\nUh uh their ranking of him as a from well qualified because of his temperament because of his scream or because of his anger\n... [noise] [noise] yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalpost and beyond that goes all the goalpost\nBecause Grassley and flake let it happen they allow them to move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened the vote so that's on them\n... ... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake or you're talking about friday as\nTo why they they have the number they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently this\nIs where it had changed according to reports this flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nOtherwise the da da da da da da da she's a she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament to serve because he got angry excuse me somebody you're ... and that just beautiful ... they they sit there and they accuse you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "Torrington", "day": "01"}
