the two party system is pretty much it it controls the United states of America can throw\nUp the road back to you oh yeah no I I agree and you know you may not it sounds like you're discouraged 'cause you're a libertarian and they never win certainly any big offices and I have friends who are libertarians obviously I say obviously because on my side but I Do have people Democrats were my friends and\nSo on but the two parties it it's well it's a vault in this country and that they got elected to office you got to be Republican or Democrat almost always some small offices even a green

...\nWhen in Los Angeles actually a friend of mine was small office community college board but she wanted and I'm from the Green Party member so it can be done but the big offices\nWith all the structure in the requirements to get on the ballot or certainly for president a working your way down to it's too difficult and a lot of people are going to support you for a third party to make it so I'm Sorry go ahead\nNo that that out of it but it's become sort of arc or that I'm On the streets of it you know what\nBut but what it does it it can throw some people it controls that I mean it it is what it is and and you know when I hear you say you know people hate the conservatives are they hate this you know hey\nIs a very powerful word the bird power or I'm not you know I Do like some of the people in the other party I mean I'm I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump do it um\nYou know I I Can't believe that he's not a Kennedy by now uh you know and the mob India however you know I hate saying it it it it's over taken a day\nAnd and you know I grew up in the eighties we didn't have this kind of hay and uh you know it\nIt it's really hard to swallow\nWhat's in my you know kids grow up in the hate environment and I\nDon't like that word\nMhm well I I understand that you know I appreciate your call I understand that you don't like no I'm Glad you didn't say you hate that word\nBut to understand that the ... but that's what that's going on and that's why I said we ... it looks like we have the second civil war notice I didn't see that I said that the I think Democrats Mr misinformed and they think we're evil so that's that's a big difference right there let's go to a\nThat is Joe ... Virginia Joe you're on with mark\nMark the morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic and I'm I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but ah I Want it to all of a you know on Facebook I shut down Facebook just because even if I had\nIt with my friends and family only I still found endless arguments on there for I mean just for no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um it it almost feels to a point some times when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really\nDon't don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the she obviously got an ... billion socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what you saw\nA but uh it's it's depressing hanging there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time just hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to say too much about it except for one of the whole was had a\nWith frankly have there's a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to say what he did it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a hundred and Twenty years or something\nAnd then um one day a host said to me you know mark or\nHer father died and she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole out I never got a chance to say goodbye so they haven't talked for I think was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons\nSo one has to think that eventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMarkets\nHappening is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nAnd mark is great to talk to you I'm I've been to a you know Republican and conservative my whole life so I went into the military right after high school\nAnd um it most of the people um\nThat I met in the military were bitter because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support for a raise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know just that okay well if they're for being that I'm for them\nUm and then as time went on um when\nI'm the first I'm a Gulf walk him about um I just remember you know listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause\nAt the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and\nI'm just want it to listen and you know he's found conservative radio and\nYou know I never really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them\nAnd um when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I think he's for someone who's just you know terrible and I'm just like\nYou're going to stand I've been mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and he's doing conservative saying things to make our country better and\nYou know I I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we have the greatest the economy in that we in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean do you see jobs for truck drivers are the key five thousand dollar bonuses for someone who starts a job\nYou know I mean for construction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and they and you know these tech job that paid huge amount of money so sick you know if you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get to Dr driving a truck for work in construction and you know\nEveryone seems to be still upset and close to stand back and look what's going on but you know I I had a friend\nTell me right to my face I get so mad at you when I when I read the things you've so that I just want to shoot you in the head and she made the hand signal legumes owning a gun at my cat and I I just just so hurt by that and\nYou know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and it just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't be friends with Amanda because she like tunnel Trump than I I just don't want to be around her anymore and it\nIt is hurtful and um yeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of this\nI'm a transgender woman so a lot of people on the right hated me for the trans up from the left heated me because I like Donald Trump and you know my ... a lot of people my family dislike me because I've transition and and also because I'm Republican and then I have a\nTrans people that looked at me like how can you be Republican if you're training she hates us and I'm just like really doesn't you know and so it's like all these angles coming at me telling me that I'm wrong for being who I Am and I don't think there's anything worse than life people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it's it's just horrible well\nI feel your pain that I had to use the bill Clinton line but the\nI can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to be I Can't imagine what you're going through a it is it's tough enough of the challenges the regular life holds for all of us let alone or when your friends or a band than you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nOf to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people\nUh that you know we're racists bigots and homophones as a whole this kinda stuff when we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that may\nI ... I Am as a volunteer work for\nYou mean it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that that may work and I\nI have a volunteer work for a ...
