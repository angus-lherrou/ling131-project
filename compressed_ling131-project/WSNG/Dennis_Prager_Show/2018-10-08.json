let's forget about the left doesn't care about you know uh you don't get any points on that that by the way Senator Lindsey Graham ah on Sunday Morning but you don't get any points from the ... not that Lindsey Graham was trying to get\nOn from the ... by supporting sort of my work and Kagan uh but you see the situation and they what they forget is the process and what they forget is how many people on Capitol Hill or at least\nDid on Capitol Hill respect the process at one time\nOkay just little nit picking mhm I Know was it was a good battle to win stumped the war but it was a good battle the wet right uh I just hope for the next Supreme Court justice and and I just hope they started laying the base now that\nThe Republican Party stopped calling the judges conservative judges mhm you and I've gone through this before\nWe talk about how we even have got caught saying it just because you know it it's a ... but they're not conservative judges there's a complete and total difference between what conservatives wanted a Supreme Court justice and what liberals want ... uh we want to Supreme Court justice that has an originalist or a ... you know and\nOr construction is somebody will look at the text of the of of the constitution whatever it is and say it says this and I'm not going to read into it\nIrrespective of whether it hurts my day to day politics a Supreme Court justice putting them into office was not about my day to day politics it's about upholding the constitution of the United states it is about the legislate short making laws\nAnd not an unelected the judge to the left\nIs about an unelected judge making law making legislation ... we go back to\nA sort of my or a when she was a at that the one comfort one college conference and talked about you know a a federal judge making policy and then got caught and said oops I Know we're not supposed to be ... said that and\nThey're all over the place on their opinions\nAs their opinion\nThe ends on their goal post move all over the place right so to me it was the fact\nThat you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left what you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream\nOf the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\n[noise]\nAnd we'll slander and the fame somebody's character\n[noise] without evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was\nThe burn in my ear ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years

rid of the Senate [noise] so have you ever to the electoral college go to the Senate that fits our\nEntire narrative that I actually hate the constitution of the United states and ... actually don't

SCOTUS judge win the presidency hey let's get back to Russia collusion\nWell it's about time\nThere's a couple of Russian collusion stories are out there but but not the Republicans are Trump

[noise] ... [noise]\nIn front of radio aims are funny and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six\nNinety or red eye Eric I'm sure you agree with me on this we haven't even had the discussion on this but I think one of the things that were Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger is in just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rain has always been there well excuse me it's been there for the last couple of decades\nAnd right now I Will say but it has been the last couple of decades it was there a Bush I guess that we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was one who said well yeah you know we we said Bush was have or we said Romney was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is [noise]\nYou know as we found out it doesn't matter who you are [noise] if\nYou are on the other side they will come after us they will defame knew their range will be amplified\nAnd will continue to be amplified to the point where you're like I really can't believe when you when you look at it when you saw some of these protesters you say I really can't believe that you know these these people have\nA critical thinking fought that actually goes through their head\nWell keep in mind I mean you know for a at least five days or so Jeff Flake was a hero remember when Coons called him a hero he was a hero in all this when he delayed the process\nUh that was until the vote\nYour hero until the vote that it it doesn't matter who you are even if you're on the left they don't you're not useful to them anymore ... does not need ... Obama campaign is that [laughter] so it doesn't matter who you are you're not immune for ... electronics here's your forecast\nSee the bulk of the showers today extent from northern Texas along I thirty five in through Oklahoma and Kansas and portions of Iowa into I Ninety four country where some of that rain could turn over to snow\nAs you get near the Canadian border primarily dry in the northeast the mid Atlantic and much of the south today Gulf Coast states have a chance of rain California will be dry we've got spotty showers for the Pacific northwest and chances are with this persistent weather pattern in place\nAll the protestors go home and it's you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ... I'm not going to happen it's not going to happen because you're not going to move want it when\nWant to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\nYou're not going to have\nThem well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given\nWhen when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change the mind of the elect tours no that didn't happen in fact Hillary had a net loss of life doors and\nTrump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts in anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that ... that the process is that\nThey flap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment and it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet and confirmation process\nThat was wild it was distorted if you look at it\nThe President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out so there was a supplemental background check there was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from\nThe the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well what did the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and\nYou don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do so you don't\nHave all the details ... they look back on this\nAnd they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this will\nNot that the you know the left\nWants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the babies I Want you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it wide you could not have given them or her more of an opportunity to come in and prove\nHer allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just a ... a\nPreponderance of the of of running of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nI and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done there are there what what in what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out was Ford who said that her the the uh the notes and\nWhether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist nodes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean there there isn't if if you can point to where the two of the the\nAs the FBI said we only we know that ... you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh\nCame out and said that ah you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview or that's not the point the point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses to this actual event bright she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right can cooperate and say\nThat anything happened in that case and none of them said anything\nShe had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nWith those no she could have handled them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the uh when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman ask\nAsk for them because the the story came out that she and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI that's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her\nAnd the supplemental background check that really is convenient oh no we were willing we call them we were going to give them you know I haven't\nYou're having to come to you have plenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and\nThe Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance to the left has\nOn the ... the only thing the left has is again that was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you're never believe the the the man you had white males in the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case you know of of the political trial because that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview\nUh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath under penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview\nOr you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistake and it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that an allegation should\nBe enough ... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough really is that where you are now the allegation is enough and then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well\nOr it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent such as a matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yes yeah so then you get what you want just to multiple unverified allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just the if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy ... they were trying to get you to buy that the allegation\nIs enough\nThen if a woman says it in this case it must be bully not another cases but just this particular case it must be believe now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist uh up\nFor for a man or defending yourself in a passionate\nWay shows guilt mhm uh everything\nThat they are wild does not pass\nThe rational thought or critical thinking test ... none of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats\nThis is the main stream of the Democratic party in is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party [noise] and they're trying to get you\nJust to throw away or any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence\nWhen the polling came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all are witnesses that they couldn't cooperated with the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers uh the the process was even distorted to that extent\nSo in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was voted along party lines with with what Chou exceptions really\nAnd in other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else you have and he was Kavanaugh was up there it would have been the exact same ... same thing the division was not created by Trump it was not
