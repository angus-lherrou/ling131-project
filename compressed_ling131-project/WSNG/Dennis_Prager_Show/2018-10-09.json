that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm\nBut they said despite that chair and I I read the ten pm central discussion on and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place or this this element essentially that would\nDiminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess I'm\nDespite that and they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five miles I\nUh it is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there\nUh and the and the Gulf Coast and on the panhandle of Florida\nListen to the

system works and let's say they took the house they could impeach\nHim [noise] that doesn't mean he's out of office so that is simply an impeachment ... and then\nIn you're never going to pass the

more interesting [noise] [noise] yeah that's it is that uh you know just kind of ... ... ... ... ... if you look if you go back\nTo the history of ah of Brock Obama's political career\nWho he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right but the community organizer especially in the Chicago area oh that could mean and a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means a you know for politically\nOr for any area not just Chicago but getting people to the polls\nThey they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they own that better than the Republicans in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it in two thousand eight [noise] and in two thousand twelve they beat\nRomney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls be the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney\nAnd Barack Obama President Obama at that time and the polls showed that Mitt Romney on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so a massive massive numbers or the difference was the organization guess what happened in twenty sixteen\nOr the ... had been working in the the DNC to see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that\nAh but the RMC [noise] where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed to\nAh after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about\nCan call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and that's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw ... and it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizer\nEnded up winning that nobody saw and it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing the organization you know that she's trying to speak on it it really doesn't apply internally\nI mean whipping the votes is one thing the Democrats\nDo have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after Ocasio Cortez is gone for you and I kind of touched on the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion you know and and not you know but look the other way with an Joe mansion\nIn certain cases and and not really worry about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\n[noise] [noise] [noise] the\n... the entire equation is not going to change in fact\nI don't think the Democrats are the party would want it to change because on many issues or they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do\nWell and she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate will that happens all the title and that that ... that that's stating are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader the partying you well you may not believe that she is and she is in right now but the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on President did television time\nFrom the mainstream media\nAs a ... a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago one of the because\nThey said you know they basically was the leader of the DNC has basically said she used to get she's the future right I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what but that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because\nThey see what's going on with the left by the way uh you know from the outside in\nWho who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats well it's it's overall if you were to term it collectively it's the protester it the extreme\nLeft ... ... what's the problem with that is that\nHow many different protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and a a a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Brock Obama to campaign for 'em in taxes is because\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter who you are\nWait a minute though you know what's gonna happen if if ... loses Obama's going to come out and say\nOh he should've used my endorsement well that's what did he go party will say he ... he rejected my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting Obama's a endorsement but really I mean that I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago\nSo you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember the the political I dollar tree\nFor president or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was an I'll look at it today now out of\nIt now I ... yeah our our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ...\nYou know one writer years after his out now we don't want him why is it\nBecause ... and that's it what what a Casio Cortez doesn't include here is internally\nExternally the political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside\nA that's a good portion and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans have if the Republicans were jailed last year or as the president's ah took office in January of twenty Seventeen like uh they are now after capital then\nWe probably would see if they were jailed on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely but that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of living\nSee if they were ... on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely but that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being a president in in in one year and then gone and the next\nWell with the left\nThe problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go in are you going to be with the feminists are the trends genders because you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted\nRight three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created\nThey they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and in doctrine aiding children and and\nAnd young people to believe that it was that it's white to wake up today and find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday\nPresident Obama or just not really into you any more\nI mean I wouldn't want to do was speaking engagement inside that but that Iran take our but think about it shows you how the political wins yes Ken Ken just\nBlow the one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime and make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office yeah ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need his endorsement here\nAnd that's because and and you and I talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the science because the left believes he truly was into liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it\nReally for the cause he was and it just because of the gig right but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left as they thought\nHe did and worked with his own party as closely as as many thought he was going to eight six six Ninety run by\nSomebody else was guilty of active arrows and regardless of radio I\nListen to
