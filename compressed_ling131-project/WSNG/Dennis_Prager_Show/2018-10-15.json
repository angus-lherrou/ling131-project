use the midterms to shoulder and clearly that's not the way to do politics in America that well what is needed in America is the parties to to debate the issues and to\nUse reasons or two\nBut you know they come yeah they they don't go ahead\nWell as we ...\nThat's yeah that's been there playbook though not just since the last two years with Trump\nTheir play book and I remember Harry Reid saying that Romney didn't pay his taxes here from someone in your mid layer on it was a lie but it said it was effective well they'll do anything the book and the worry is it looks like they could win the house representatives and if they do you can't imagine what the next two years ago and it'd be like for President Trump and for all us run\nThat tried and it's it's the idea that uh you're selfish and justify yourself which means um and that's what the Democrats are using as they're guiding principle um they're selfish and there's\nA are justified by their selfish lanes and ah\n... they also think they have truth on their side they're arrogant as I said\nAnd when you arrogant and you think if you think you have the truth then you can do anything right the ends of the means are justified by the ends right or the actually either way you said it works because they just feel like in say anything and do anything because we're evil and they're good\nWill actually thought they could

into Colorado along I twenty five you're going to pick up the potential for snow\nWe'll see mainly all rain as you get into Oklahoma and north Texas the rain showers will extend from central Texas today into the architects and lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys clearer conditions are bound today for a good portion of the west west of the Rockies the northern plains will be clear\nYeah well I I Would suggest to you that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the facts many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think to me the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea that allegations are enough to convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is outrageously is against the whole system where innocent until proven guilty\nHe was guilty just because he was accused of it and so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections but Robert I I think of your call and hang in there okay\nLike thank you very much twenty five there's hope let's go to a\nOkay David you think people are voting for or a dead huh God David in Cedar Rapids OK\nI'm OK what it is just the uh after my grandfather and my mother and my grandmother ... passed away a I've noticed that um\n[noise] I joined the share you know Lincoln county Republican caucus committee you count people who are at the polls who now it'll take a look at you know all of ... you know and they see how people are voting\nAnd I've noticed that you know when looking for records that for some reason my grandfather and my grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama twice even though they die before [noise]\nDid you report it to anybody that I tried to take some action\nI did and it's just that you know it it was kind of like a yelling out of a stone wall\n[noise] you know they weren't willing to ... [laughter] yeah no there's a real problem\nYelling out of the stone wall\n[noise] you know they weren't willing to um yeah no there's\nA real problem with voting integrity in this country\nAnd it was known for years of people in Chicago people voted in Chicago but now across the country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity of the election system anything could happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won\nBecause it I Believe that we're fighting that kind of fraud that people wrote in in California you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted that thousands of people voted there they said there was some things with the voting machines\nWe got a real problem when you can trust the outcome of the election\nWell the thing is is that\nHow the link county Republican a cock his committee changed here in Cedar Rapids was that we got a whole new Patrick people in a whole new batch people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my vote is actually counted\nAnd so we have all these younger people who says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust\nIs being ... and that's how we changed from Democrats city to a Republican city getting us last election\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take take into account illegal immigrants right\nIf illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants devoted to Republicans aren't going another election at least nationally uh in our lifetime or there's no hope would you let people vote who are unqualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou're you brought up a great blow election\nActually got to get her to go a little something there ... there [noise] okay it's all depends on how you treat the individual\nIf you treat unless people who may be here illegally but are contributing to society now because I've worked you know many a warehouse agency jobs where there are plenty of illegals that were working there but as long as you\nTreat them like human beings are not you know being angry because they're illegal just realized that our system the child's for so long that we know integrated people that you know\nIn a in another no way they should have been there in the first place but because they are good to us and we were good to them [noise] maybe\nThe idea that illegals would probably vote Republican is not out of the questions not the problem\nWe're not quite as it's not yeah\nIt just because it's tied to want to get on to our topic necessarily the problem is if you don't have a way of entering the country legally then you're sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into it you know I certainly think people should be treated well\nBut whether they should be allowed into a country is another issue you have borders or you don't but I don't want to open up that for us right now uh you know it it's bigger than just a few minutes it is not a matter of treat them well in fact I don't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally they degrade people that's not the point\nI fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue and speaking of issues let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety read either that's also eight six six or seven\nThirty three thirty nine let's see we have time for another called was in the segment Charles been waiting ... spots where does that New Jersey\n...
