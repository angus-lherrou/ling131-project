you're doing now\nFor a said in a paragraph that he believes Trump's supporting Jewish people should essentially be exiled from society running that people should refuse their money and make them unwelcome synagogues quote any strategy print hadn't seen the security of American\nUh Jews should involve shutting Trump's Jewish enablers their money should be refused their presence in synagogues not welcome they have placed their community in danger\nYeah [laughter] no I mean it's just getting by I don't I just don't get it I just don't I don't um I don't get where they believe that this is again a good strategy\nI mean blaming Trump for everything pretty much everything that's wrong and things that aren't wrong\nI heard someone say the other day about the economy well but it would be a lot better if you look we've had the discussion on terrorists and everything else but the fact of the matter is is right now the economy's looking fairly healthy the question is will it be sustained\nIf the terrorists stay in place and they were ... but this was this wasn't even on terrorists\nThis was just to comment basically on if it weren't Trump anybody but Trump would have a better economy\nWell that's just blatantly falls because I don't know of one Republican that would have gotten to down to Twenty one percent\nOn the corporate tax rate I don't know of one Republican that was going to get tax cuts anywhere below thirty percent I can guarantee anybody who said that was not able to back it up\nNo okay well of course not as just as just as they're not\nAnywhere below thirty percent I I can guarantee anybody who said that was not able to back it up no okay well of course not as just as just as they're not able to back up you know him being an anti Semite or him being responsible for this or that\nThey can never back what did they ever been a recently ... ... what did they ever been able to back anything\nThey don't have to blame Trump there must be useful\nEasy enough of a target\nBig red barn that's what he's become\nA Democrats this is from MSN dot com Democrats were sounding growing alarms and the final push before the midterm elections the party lacks the message it needs to ... President Trump and went back democratic majorities in Congress as\nWe haven't had a real message since the last presidential election so wide change it now\nIs a democratic strategist Chris ...\nWe had no message in twenty sixteen we had no message in between you have no message going into this election you have to give people a reason to vote for you not a reason just to vote against someone else Democrats think they have a good chance of retaking the house majority despite problems given the fact\nThat they're voting base is fired up\nOr to send a message to Trump polls have tightened however and there is recognition that Trump has started to fire up his own base the narrow path\nThe Democrats once saw for the Senate majority has largely disappeared ... in terms of the Democratic party having even a semblance of the message it's just not there and that's the reason this election is going to be unpredictable said ... nobody should be surprised if it's a good night ... or a bad night [noise]\nUh Democrats found a winning formula in two thousand six when they captured both chambers with the promises to champion a series of specific policy proposals raw early the following year including the minimum wage hike and cuts in student loan rates this cycle they replace that design\nWith the shorter slate a broader themes\nA preferred blueprint in their eyes because it allows democratic candidates to tailor their message to the concerns and demographics\nOf individual districts sounds like a hope and change philosophy right ... ah this is not a national campaign sedan see below sea or it's one district at a time you had Democrats outside capital or voicing concerns that a blurry or message could haunt Democrats at the polls\nVoters left on certain what the party stands for Rahm Emanuel the Chicago Mayor and former chairman of the house democratic campaign arm said his party needs to be more clear in his message for the country or I don't want to say we did everything right into six but we had a six and six agenda set of ideals\nAre that are very clear to a second democratic strategist that Emanuel makes a great point I couldn't tell you exactly what we stand for no so in that sense I think Romney's right\nAt least back then we had a target we knew we needed to do to get there I Can't say the same now\nAnd that's troubling\nThey talked about democratic leaders are quick to reject that notion because they've talked about health care costs and boosting wages and finding government corruption by the way I'm fighting government corruption if there isn't a more useless campaign issue to go on\n... by the way any government corruption when you think of a government corruption ... for the Democrats\nWhat would you think of ...\nIf I write or a Democrat if you're a Democrat I mean you're well if you're an American ride to Democrat or Republican Russia inclusion right and we know it was the Democrats who colluded with the Russians not the\nNot the not the Republicans there's no evidence of it ... and any government corruption that you could look at right now and I don't know they claim they're running a I'm On corruption I don't know where I haven't seen an ad on corruption\nBut if I one thing but if they were they could promote if they wanted to get away ... or if they wanted to help eliminate any type of corruption or around doing\nIn the process is a support voter id certainly they are pressing for that right yeah I think they're talking government ... right I Know but you start with the idea that because that's where it comes\nYou know you come down to all the voter fraud situations and you often have\nOfficials that are involved and so\nThe biggest my my point was the biggest ... the biggest question on corruption is the Obama administration and the FBI and the department of justice and our intelligence agencies it is on the uh the size of course\nRebuke in the Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens when it comes to secret warns\nThose are the things that we used to view\nThe ... when I say we [laughter] I mean we all but specifically liberals use to care about uh\nBut we used to view the ... but when I say we [laughter] I meant we all but specifically liberals used to care about\nYou know up until about a month ago yeah\nAbout they cared about that and from spin off well no I mean the ... if you think about the Russian collusion thing they cared about that all about among right up right at a disappear\nI haven't heard anything on it right I mean they're not campaigning on on any of that now\nIt's that Trump is responsible for these suspicious packages a and the synagogue shooting and the most evil and heinous acts bats and the and the ... when the ... the ... ... ... ...\n... the current events Trump's fall that the by the way that's a beautiful what Trump's fault the gear that then you believe what he's doing\n... done anything yet yeah eight six
