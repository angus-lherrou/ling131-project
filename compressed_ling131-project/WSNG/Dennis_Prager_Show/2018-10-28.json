I'm ... eight six six Ninety read\nI welcome and a good morning I'm I just I just want to address an email that I got yesterday because it was just too good 'cause we we were talking about economic things just today and\nWe're talking about uh the uh uh you know the corporate tax ... and and as we said before I keep forgetting we always get new listeners but\nBut uh I'd made the comment as we've made before that corporate taxes hurt for the most and this person just wrote me just completely baffled by what do you mean those are good for corporations I had to explain to them no\n... or you pay everything that a corporation is when you see it is financed by the consumer\nYou know every right to uh their their their profits were financed by you everything's financed by by money to pay their taxes right the the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by the consumer\nYour the consumer pay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they still tax on the consumer you don't see it directly and therefore what does it hurt the most who has the least expendable income ... support for cobra electronic here's your forecast\nA wet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday\nAnd we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast as well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes and that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains\nTo provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dried this weekend\nFocus on those but beyond that\nBuild the momentum forward and you know got a couple of emails from yesterday's show\nYou know and they were talking about what do you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation we're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle that win elections for you\nRight that's who you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially\nTo put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to shoot ... customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that\nThe the the one that because it sounds like that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll get my mind you and then the ... and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back and said look I'm Talking about you are right yeah this is going to change it I'm not talking about my\nI wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me who is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well hadn't Donald that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not\nPart of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we've been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats instead of\nLosing seats and this was back then\nNot thoroughly now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of\nWho have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group the the Republicans but more importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get a message out there is there\nIs this an and we continue to to fight this all the time or we will get people to call when you guys think that you can convince everybody we don't know [noise] ... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that\nLook people [laughter] people evolve every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started all you know\nListening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and you know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely\nPeople change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday undecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it and we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way as\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you saw it on shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you\nYou're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time and you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost ... probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that\nIs the goal the goal is to win [noise] ... ... the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate he used a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that\nAnd that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there you're kidding me into it like it just would you like to sit in this chair for the last\nAlmost Thirty years and I don't know it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show host for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an Tom [laughter] it's always a very old high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table in oh it's like sitting on a beach\nIt's like that just sitting there on a ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their emerging island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after day\nHere has peers and\nAnd so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil\nYou know that's not our goal look after them on the issues going after them when I was with a you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong\nAnd and be very clear about it that's part of it but the rhetoric is doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that\nYou feel like there's this limited window and that the the the windows closed and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that ... because we've been doing it so long and we've seen\nThe do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean match the doors are just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media\nAnd communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... they you can set the messages are ahead\nOf time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now around the clock ... the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins and you're building again\nThe base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already\nWhat frustrates me his understanding that the left\nBut then again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to\nThat it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back [noise] we don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell\nAnd we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a part of their former leader was in Nevada the other night\nAnd we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president in two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night Nevada ... who are well [noise] um well almost big was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic\nWhat would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or ... or\n... Iraq Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote ... they're going to win ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote [noise] okay\nCan you can you can add benefit\nAnd as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side and but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality in on the right it's not\nI still don't like political idea I I just don't like\nPolitical I dollar free we worship a candidate and it's still always bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas [noise] right [noise] that are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet\nThen I get it but as you ... you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell of the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism yeah [noise]\nWell except for free stuff yeah yeah for every ... or eight six six Ninety run I [noise]\nWas busted for red are ready to go with a record ...
