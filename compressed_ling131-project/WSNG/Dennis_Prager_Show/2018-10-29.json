I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it's it's something that you and I've talked about before where we've we've said\nA ... for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody great you how you doing what's going on who you're voting location what's going on good to see a oh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care of everyone I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice but I don't think I've ever had a\nNon pleasant time ever voting in my life right but that's actually the reality of a you know of of what goes on for the vast\nMajority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media and you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's a it's\nThe news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why that's why murders [noise] our new system because for the most part they don't happen to the vast\nMajority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the\nTime I never encounter [noise] a a a murder\nRight many ... some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still ... mass shootings mass murders are quite low but when you look at the\nAge of psychopaths that exists out there are a when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday\nAnd talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting as she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not named going through that progression of her there's no campy and then\nSend convince his brother had 'cause that Ted 'cause the exact same thing just a\nDoor on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with reality and it's not that it gives any\nYou know um there was no owners or or or responsibility on the part of his brother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning at ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of\nDoing or was capable it turned out\nOf doing a a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nOf the shooter at the at the center God [noise] you know you think of that and I'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to close or is there something that I could have done we all\nOr in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to\nYou know close or is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with in our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people\nIt's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people\nAnd we can talk about disagreements but I\nWas put it like this it's like a family you could sit around and and if you go spend enough time with your family you can sit around and you can have the ... you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because\nWhen you put this all in perspective we're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case and we should be the case\nOr when you\nTalk about the the tactics right now being used [noise]\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights [noise]\nAnd and instead we're looking at more and more\nTaking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something that is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people the very few\nThat have these arranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts\nWe'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it and try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society is going to happen [noise]\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up if you'd like to get in lines open eight six six Ninety run I\n[noise] ... goals eight six six zero fall on the radio [noise]\n",
