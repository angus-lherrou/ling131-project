was hard to ...\nIndependent Bob just called me a few times just ranting I think he knew was vacation he just ranting and raving from Elizabeth Warren thing just send him into outer space yeah he's just like this is just won\nThe they they believe that a good thing to do that they believe that\nThis is a good tactic you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the ...\nI mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file with the protesters talking about the people holding off of their political tactics I mean there are many this is\nTheir mainstream political tactics\nAnd they believed stuff like this is going to work and and that's and you and I made sure that before we went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet not understand this is the mainstream now\nOf the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well this isn't the average Democrat it's the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate\nRight [noise]\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the three big problems that she by the way the way they were down just the the three well one one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she is Native American you won't white privilege that's white privilege fried rice on cultural appropriation\nYeah right and and again\nThey believe they're on the right track I Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that to the polls everything else got a great Joe ... for cobra electronic here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there is a low pressure system and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that ... at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow\nWhich ultimately they did\nA during the a committee vote on on on Capitol or you know and that you had come out here as going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protests after the thing they still voted yet and they still voted [noise] so there wasn't offensively anything you know it it was show about it\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meaning we'll just get up and walk out [noise] this is this is the ... this is a mainstream Democrats\nToday this this is not the protesters [noise] and we talked about how the protestors the lead the party [noise] they lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes\nAnd different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction [noise] and it's it's it's\nAnd then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter\n[noise]\n[noise] right does it does is destroyed transgender isn't ... if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the leftist starting to embrace fried or remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was\n[laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons you know socialist\nIcons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior rules and regulations [laughter]\nNumber one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh that writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter]\nIt is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] where does that decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great style\nAnd if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people forget about that because again what you know that when\nPresident Obama mhm just before he left office I Believe that was the was the lead her New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with and they asked him you know why do you say that you're black\nWhen you know members right next mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... so is that\nIt it now is that done now has the left moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules or other social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent ... ... ... ...\nEverything from cultural appropriation to the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science miss the war and [laughter] I remember when Benjamin bureau brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence [noise]\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions housing you know which one is the role\nOf here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom the roads out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on ... whenever\nTrump does like ... hold my beer I think that we'll watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out debt names any planets day they were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half\nA second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fourth of a second [laughter]\nMy\nMy my favorite was the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fours they're Navy SEAL and it was a ... which\nI I with a gun [laughter]\n... swimming pool or it gets you know that that's it it really is the that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win for them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat that she's pretty safe\nLike Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things as safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being\nYou want to enter the arena and twenty twenty or for the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean ... but all level although Hillary was a contender for both um [laughter]\n\nWe do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring that out\nLook again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do the protester type attitude but do they have up on stage you know we talked about this is a few months ago we're talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump that will be gold number one you've got to show your anger\nAnd you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more in terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for that so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage\nDuring that primary season and that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because no longer can you have\nA debate [noise] [noise] no longer can you have a real discussion ... ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering ... as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no a jobs we need more jobs and\nWe haven't ... finding enough people right now I'm I'm so in the what are you going to do\nJobs we need more jobs ... ... we have ... finding enough people right now I'm so ... the what are you going to do it while you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display or you know the one who hates them most is gonna win always\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free yeah yeah and I mean ... ... and that we are other game we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do we used to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation of of the tactics\nOut there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states right by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed at the very little response so we got from Democrats some Sprite where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we don't know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the cars that by the way that gained ground over their vacation that now the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college has to go to the Senate has to go and what they\nWhat they may not realize it but that's when you get into not caring\nThat belief get you to the point of not caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate has this that's why the electoral college at you know it exists because we're not a direct democracy were republic where constitutional Republican a republic why to protect individual rights that the Democrats\nAnd the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they don't write\nAnd so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats ... ...\nI I you're you're spot on and ... but the problem there is what\nCNN [noise]\nJake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from Ocasio Cortez and Gillum separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that\nForget about the media ask wasn't so tough but they did ask the question if your Hillary and you get back\nIn and twenty twenty the it used to be the boiling the frogs slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Ocasio Cortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody a rhino let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just get cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college [noise]\nYeah ... ... and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff you know you've got to go full on like the rest of them did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred thousand dollars to exactly or one ticket to the mega millions later this week yet [laughter] eight six six Ninety ride I\nFilled with ... radio toll free at age
