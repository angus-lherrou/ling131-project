the people that are are now staying that uh you know once the or\nThe winds get over fifty miles an hour our first responders or police fire they're not going to be able to get to you so hopefully you've got enough water and a and food and stuff to take care of yourself\nMayor Greg a bird Nikki of Panama City Florida where it looks like a ...\nThey've got enough water and a and food and stuff to take care of yourself mayor Greg a bird\nNikki of Panama City Florida where it looks like a you know it's it's headed right right towards and the developments if you want to know the developments over the last couple of hours the uh ten pm a National Hurricane center\nOr update chose it now at a what a hundred and twenty five miles an hour the winds right and expected to be right now over a hundred and thirty which would make it at least a category for hurricane that when I hit the uh panhandle Gulf Coast right\nThey're they're talking about uh the storm surge being a a a a really strong strong surgeon and talking about how the the potential uh for a life threatening conditions is really great with the storm a everyone in this area needs to heed the warnings and and listen to officials and\nAnd those directives given by officials are in the coming hours if you haven't already because\nAh you see the pictures and videos of the people in that area I I'm getting ready evacuating a boarding up windows and everything else this is a major storm already and has the potential to be ah in in most believe that will be a historic storm\nA in terms of the damage and the size of the storm or it will ah then move inland with a ton of rainfall we were talking during the pre show meeting as it moves through\nUh the uh the the panhandle of Florida and then goes into north north easterly direction toward the Carolinas that's going to be dumping a lot of rain the Carolinas ... they're saying it will move faster\nThan Florence so it won't present the same problems\nBut the problem is with the areas affected by Florence that are already saturated the ground is already saturated then of course any rain at all it's going to cause problems and they will be getting rain in those areas in the coming days\nAre but a more immediately we're looking at a at a the panhandle of Florida and Panama City essentially a being the the target right now for hurricane Mike\nTo anybody who serves in a democratic\nPresidents or a cabinet but well with when you disagree with the president how do you deal with it\n... ... of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in it's like you arrive with one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that\nAnd and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job\nYour job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I we've been talk show host too long I mean it's just we couldn't we probably couldn't do that\nOr we will get frustrated that are doing that\nEven if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you have\nTo be the national security advisor to be said to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or relaying a mess and and boat and said the same thing\nYou know because when when they asked him well you know a vital or ah [laughter] heads on John Hope [laughter] John Button was asked that he's ... he's always as you said well look when when you were in ... when when you were ah you know when you were whatever a\n... five years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the President Bush to do I was a private citizen back\nThen the president believes that everything has changed at this point that I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president and I disagree I give him advice what he does like the ... on the national security advisor advisor then I Lived in a row right I tell him what did I tell them this one I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it but then I tell you what the\nThe plan is that the president and\nI sit there and I'm just want to pull my hair out saying why are we going through this because everybody knows that already well ... but do they\nIn a nation where they can't name the three branches of government well know there were no I think the reporters do it because they want to they they're trying to find [noise] anything to show that there is discord within the administration yes yes it is at and\nThey're trying to find anything to show that there is discord within the administration yes yes it is ... and they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier and I\nI think to your point the earlier point you may as well on the list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her her spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley uh in that position as strong as\nShe has been when she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say wow she's going to go to the un and she's really going to Iraq some noise you know I don't think ... point so anybody on those lists could be you know just the strongest stronger as as she's been and\nI trust the president now or maybe not as his first year so much but I trust the president now\n... and also trust the situation and we said this in his second year as he moved into a second year of a presidency we talked about how people who were going to work with him\nI either on staff or in the cabinet [noise] would know what they were in for after that first year and so anybody who accepts that role knows what they're in for which means they're up for that job as well from their perspective

the bottom of the hour with meteorologist Tom hale he will\nUh uh joined us but uh you you know you make a great point when you talk about the fact that when you're talking about doing it I think both of us in may\nI made a fair point you made a great point ... but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for as making the analogy of you is almost like an NFL quarterback Europe in NFL quarterbacks you have no idea how they're going to perform\nYou'd have no idea right and all the time they get on the field unions like all the steak oh yeah I really really good and we I'd mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders that that you know most presidential spokes\nPeople I don't like but if you would have told me\nWhen and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it but when she came aboard I probably went\nOh I just don't think she has a right way was wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very uh she doesn't even flinch anymore\nOr ... if you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every\nSingle day now it's just it's more like a game and that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and and it it's not an easy job it's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John Bolton you know you pretty much know where you're going to get what the John Bolton but otherwise\nUh there are a lot of people on that list and and and\nWe'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for a not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course of what the president expects a drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there in the Florida Panhandle\nAt the same time is wins wrapping around the oil giant wind field work causing storms and um\nAnd tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to a cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five\nBut this is gonna blow Kate out all the water\nTom ... in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be\nWho are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline or what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore and\nIt will be properly ...\nStill a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in the in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it should be\nEntering the Carolina and\nCutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast and then they don't need any more uh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour\nFirst and then they don't need any more uh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour or when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday today or we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour and\nA and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour or when we get to a coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation\nUh from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so\nUh when it comes in if it comes in to the east Windsor going to be backing so it will reduce that effect but you get past\nThat to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola or we're looking at a storm surge that will run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet\nWhile yeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\nAnd yeah and and and so we're talking about a ... again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd all the way through an average of fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night they're going to have guns Wednesday night or as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain\nSo inland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event\nThat range gotta go somewhere and ah and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge um then from there then you start dealing with you know the rain on top of that\nAnd so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up the Neuse River New Bern is at the end of the Neuse River\nAnd they had a water rise of ten point two feet and and we had the um\nWe had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the uh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues um that night\nAbout well I'm a ... again uh the you know I there's this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are are in the path\nOf this storm need to feed all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate a ... this is this is going to be a a a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm\nAnd it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm or a Tom ... in terms of uh the the rainfall you mentioned a that we're going to see in some places maybe eight to twelve inches of rain um the flooding potential though\nWon't necessarily be like it was because of Florence because of the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee and then from there when we move across the border into Georgia we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas and I can\nPull up some maps and break that out\nUm next time we talked buttery the the fact of the matter is that it only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right and\nWe all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place and well the difference here is that this storm like the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nLike the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nYeah All right and ... and when when you expected to onshore\nI expect onshore between three and four o'clock okay hum this afternoon they're\nAlright alright media Ronald just Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and they don't standing coverage for us\nAs he mentioned with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year
