[noise] so\nUh yeah here we are there we go um were inside of a two weeks now well it will be ... it will be two weeks from right now that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw you know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles dating well no that's not the case and that's why\nWe'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just get everything the pollsters may\n... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a you know pretty good especially in a presidential election but they missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even close over the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over\nThe Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane ... in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding and severe weather in place for the region\nAnother whether maker will be a surface low near the southern tip of Texas so a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nVery um you know from you you can go just a from where I live to just uh you know several miles north and the tax rate\nVaries greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences the amount of I've ... my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a ... my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it\nUm but even aside from that if you've got a a a home that's worth more than ... your taxes are higher\nAnd and with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich weren't heartland about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle\nClass right and they're getting had and they don't like it and once they're only recourse right now\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message by Republican congressman ... and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and\nEven though won't change everybody's followed\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the boat yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know best\nBut the boat yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole Kavanaugh thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that may ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going to we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it\nRight in the ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm\nYesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears it along expected decline is here now the economy overall may not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us but the steel and and on the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that there are still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising their price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody is using the new name by the way [laughter] All right and and uh the his you know and they only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about foreign grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the tariffs are guns that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business of deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or feeling it already and every dealership and every day it was a member of the steel tariffs really been affected that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel cause and now because of terror cost and because of the new NAFTA\nOr and then the farmers as we had mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about uh your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country and you're talking about farmers that are ... dream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits but\nIt's a fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you're sort of wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right\nThere was a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt that it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's for farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nUh and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada ah any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war chair of the ... went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time around the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right\nAh or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time around the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is one of the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the ... the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our last his All right and we're ... we're we're ... we're out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession the problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government\nOr during the recession or in two thousand eight and to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they there were free apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well they've made all the banks look\nRisky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you can rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else or another nation in this case ... and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this uh election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good ... well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city":
