I'm from of course when you understood why\nThey pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with you know after reconstruction you know it had to civil rights act of Eighteen sixties over right right where you knew that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes [noise] that that's what that's what it was all about\nBecause of the parents of of those children being born the children being born slaves\nThe the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction now that the problem is because I as I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I I'd I'd be you know\nThat's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live but [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty Years' war All right let's throw out a figure\nOnly Thirty years [noise] um you know I [noise] I I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this uh [noise] but the problem is the Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act\nThey added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say\nA children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that [noise] [noise] and so the courts probably will look at that saying well since at that time\n[noise] they didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree in the law should change\nAnd you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change that many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpreted that way\nOr we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent wasn't opinion\nAre based there that the court might just refuse to hear it\nRight\nAnd send it back down and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean ... we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\n... was it two thousand eight hundred thousand five\nTo ... I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years it if it it took ... to finally had the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment that it was an individual right\nSo a two thousand ... ... ... ... so\nThat that's the problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't I don't see it but [noise] those are the legal challenges that you face right now\nThat the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law [noise] which\nAgain this is where the fourteenth amendment was not\nWritten specifically to address it as a true construction as you would look at it and say\nDoesn't say it applies to non citizens and in order to apply in order in and you would need to that's how I Would say construction is doesn't say it if you want to save differently than say differently\nBut it but it doesn't include it but will it ever get to that point where they even the Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually\nMeans will we ever get to that legal place is my question Brian again I just I don't see it in the next Thirty years I'll Try that out for it\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling [noise] ...\nYeah I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we\nThe if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it in the courts the question is will the high court take a case like this and and so when you look at the question yesterday where I chuckle when I heard it I said well it's\nThis will the high court you take a case like this and and so when you look at the question yesterday where I chuckle when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question just kind of president do this with executive order ... of course he can if nobody challenges that can do it effectively as the question and\nAnd right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the care of him [noise]\nAh too well illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong [noise] or whether he's doing it now or any other time [noise]\nAnd the approach\nMaybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if that's the cause they know full well going to be challenged and so at\nThat point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now we understand to the uh the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly\n... or by just the announcement of between you know now and and uh well six days for the midterm uh but beyond that it is also something that I think in the current political climate [noise] that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do [noise]\nNow it it [noise]\nIt brings up the discussion but I think it gets us closer\nTo and hopefully somebody on the right will position the Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm so that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick\n[noise] ... this isn't going to happen [noise] ah\nIt the ... the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be a new media a block from the courts\nAnd then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get well and I don't go to see if it ever\nGet right and this is something that I ... I I again I doubt it would be fast track you know because because it's it's not like to travel ban right that affected people immediately right so\nIt was it was not jailing with with like what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat that we had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and\nThat it was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world and and that was something that they could make a the the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has\nBeen a threat for a long long time the problem is well get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years\nBut it is not something that is going to be fast tracked because it is it is not adding any kind of knew immediate threat we understand what's going on with the hospitals on the board I Know that growing up on the board I Know exactly what their burden with and", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "31"}
