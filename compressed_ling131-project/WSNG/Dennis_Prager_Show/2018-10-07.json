Radio Welcome to the show I\nThank you um I I was watching the Christian network this afternoon and what other correspondents was talking about ... Ford won the FBI to have hurt\nWell it worked this afternoon and what other correspondents was talking about ... Ford wanting the FBI to have hurt therapy notes from two thousand\nTwelve and no no no no she didn't know she did she tell you well she did and I mean not all of that is what she did not want back she was holding back\nThe notes from that there is from the FBI no no she was holding them back to the Senate not from the from the Senate yes the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there is a big difference in other words within it is the thin it as part is and the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWell no you can give it to the Democrats then\nYou give it to the Democrats them and they ... and they present it and the people get to see it the FBI ... well he once you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with them I wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check the impact what the FBI would do with it\nWould be put it into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI has been tire equation is to give the Senate the information you're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end\nUp in the partisan body anyway that's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate I mean she would officially be dip putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that\nDuring the process and the I agreed to take out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it and\nUh it's a ... of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute and do do that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and any one and if if the ... that would if ... if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and forged assuming Ford's lawyers are telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two\nAfter because of the background check the supplemental is over a recovery electronics here's your forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa has moved north where it will see stretches of by ten\nMainly clear today with the exception of far western Texas there is a moderate to risk of excessive rainfall however from eastern Iowa into far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin\nSupporting your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation I don't know what other imprint we shouldn't draw\nFrom your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's the challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the\nThird time in writing to turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications\nWith the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key to\nLook at the uh the last sentence\nWith recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono other than\nA year communications with me and my staff member a my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing\nThe ledge witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a deadly re mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday so it was like I said in the last caller brought up as she was going to turn over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in fact they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and if it\nEnded up in the report we wouldn't see it the the the only senators\nWould set the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to the people\nThe the the only senators was said the only the centers would see at ... goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to the people who says she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nTo give it to grasp directly outside of the three oh two because then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly or\nLate and we waited for more than just release the entire rankled the silly Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n'cause they're not political [noise]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOkay that's a relief well Washington Post and the wall Street Journal [noise] no I mean\nFrom you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... uh let me see that a woman sets and here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night the Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the ah Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting\nA bum please let us know your please give to us you know what you have shared with fights time in her own oh\nWhoa mhm yeah\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have a right what what is what is that what is that one about\nSo again I'm we're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas you know with the lawyers state and they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense [noise]\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nYeah and I ate a demand that doesn't even a demand that within a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the notes would never become public right now you would never know what was in the ...\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day if you want this public there's plenty of ways to do them ...\nOr eight six six Ninety run out let's go to Sherman in Indonesia Sherman welcome urine rather Radio Welcome to the show listening online hot\nThanks good afternoon from Indonesia I'm a long time listener first time caller you know I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican as you pointed out it is just sharing committees job to investigate Kavanaugh\nAnd this whole situation and Dianne Feinstein of struck the justice I don't know why everybody is just not totally up in arms about this\nMaybe eventually they will be\nBut to me that the wheel criminal in all of this because it Feinstein it released it releases pervasive back in July it\nWould've been quietly handled and investigated thoroughly it would've maintain the anonymity of the laws they forward it would have respected Kavanaugh's reputation\nAnd they would have gotten to the bottom of this and I have a cabin or would have that bond status nomination or and believe it was a forward would have been proved to be right or not but\nI N Feinstein obstructed justice here and pull this last minute and she should be ... you know read out of town a rail for obstructing justice I mean it's a criminal act\nWell if you look at it as whom who betrayed the trust\nOf of Dr Ford\nIt was just I find it was ... it was the end it was the Democrat right now I Wonder if they're the ones that leads into the media if if if we're taking Dr forward at her word mhm then the only people that have been trained doctor Ford or the Democrats ...\nExactly and that's the biggest thing that's being missed and it is if you look at how\nMany of the ends justify the means is just over and over getting more and more brutal and I just don't understand why every American would it be up in arms over and find
