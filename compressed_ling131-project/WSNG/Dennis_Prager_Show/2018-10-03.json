an hour that seem to be a big story yesterday we went to that\nWhat happened to the size of documents story and their Russian\nCollusion because that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that well\nWell it is I mean that's it and the nobody has has covered it in and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh so\nTrump decided not to release it but he didn't go to the he didn't go to his a director of intelligence about the uh the information whether she'll be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general ... to classify something\nYou go to the inspector general give something because you perceived there might be corruption and what you have ... for ... for electronics user forecast\nMay not sound like much that an area could debt six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days in effect for multiple states including California Arizona Nevada\nUtah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil rocks and tree limbs and flood dry creek bed all due to the remains from tropical storm Rosa you'll need the wipers heavy rain on I've forty I tend\nSo that's where the Christopher Steele you know whole thing comes comes in a ... to ... a ... and ... and\nOne of the key players they're fusion GPS a was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of justice of racial Bruce Bruce or and then we know what they use\nAnd and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute just doesn't make sense you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption in\nOh a\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago on Monday or writers down and we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over and we what we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general of the inspector general you know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it and and\nAnd all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off\nIt would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is\nThe fact that people at the Justice Department under and the Obama administration\nWere more working to get\nInformation and use that false information that ... ... ah to get\nA warrant you knowingly using it to get a flies a warrant then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nWell and it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm that\nAh the he believes they committed perjury right yes that that that they they they signed documents stating that this information is intelligence mhm\nWhen in reality it was simply you know a opposition research and I was and they knew that it was an intelligence and they vouch for it's often too often to study our credibility ... and and you know again that's what Giuliani said we don't know but it only goes to the inspector\nGeneral if they believe people there because we're would begin if that was what had happened right then than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to in this case\nYou know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again the director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head\nOf the FBI a foreign powers and so you wouldn't be going in that particular direction and probably you will be discussing it especially with my palm pale secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release you know what do they want to keep quiet and\nNot that that may not be a ... that\nThat could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already\nBut to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why inspector general only looks at corruption right there looking corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice\nThat's what his job is his job is not to declassify it's not just jobs not to look at a a document say wow I don't think you should declassify in and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out it's like well wait a minute he's inspector general and under that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they unreal acted it apparently someone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption given to the inspector\nGeneral because that's because that's what you would look at it the the inspector general's basically uh their to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose\nOf that position to do that is essentially that internal\nAh investigation ... the the inspector general's office really has internal affairs or you know to a large degree so when\nAnd and it when they saw that I could see General Kelly looking at the president and saying Mr President if you come out and point things out that's going to be purely political right so it only has\nYou know there's we we have to build a political will to go after people if the inspector general comes out with an official report that's different not that the president and the end and uh the aging sessions couldn't go after people for this it's that\nIt would start in the political arena if you have\nThis over to the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is the process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done not talking about you know the things about uh\nLicensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any of that not not the words not what he said but what he has done he's been very respectful of the ...\nWould be the process you would want to go through to see the have the inspector general ... look at it and say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here to see if this is exactly if if it's what we see and then\nYou noticed the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general\nAround they somebody may have done it I've not seen it right and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen\nReally anything maybe a maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I ever McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media went completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was that the new has like\nA couple of days after said I don't know why they didn't release it I don't know understand why it went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to yeah everything that you haven't heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from a Devon noon as a in over a week on it saying well look we need to get this dumped released why\nBecause if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption and well what would the corruption be if it's about the\nBuys a warrant and the text messages that everything in the upper management\nOf the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were ...\nAnd that would be corruption inside of the department of justice and the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what he be looking at us\nAnd so yeah one so we put two and two together a little over a week ago it was like oh\nAnd there's been nothing on this story and other media the media is gone quiet all to begin with high or Russian collusion narrative [noise]\n\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus has cap and all but you know they're they're very capable of a walking and chewing gum at the same time when it comes to going out at a drop in New York Times brought up is family tax yes exactly why not collusion mowers that story\nBut that's a great point you made is you know he's going through the process and ... if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you released this then they're just going to say you're\nCherry picking and you're interpreting things I'm going to do what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general nobody's going to debate the inspector general no not even not even the ... the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michel Horwitz was right so you go\nTo him and he'd been and he does which is the proper process to do with it yes that way you take the political\nAspect out of it right and especially right now if you look at okay all the claims that well this would\nBe a disruptive of the of the more investigation and you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but all of that's taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation himself all of those\nClaims go away because or which will you know even though you know the president want want this done a ... in an expedited manner\nOr which will do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption\nYou want to get in we do have a line open eight six six Ninety right I\nI thought we would always told me he ... he wrote a [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your
