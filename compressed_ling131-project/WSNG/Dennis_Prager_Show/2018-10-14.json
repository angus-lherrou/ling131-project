he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the leftist scared to death and Kanye West because he's smack\nIn the middle of the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter ... he cannot have a different opinion and\nIf he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues that Kanye West had\nNobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when you know he was up the award show where they know on the left no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush or hates all black people because I'm Katrina didn't they write\n... that that that's not because ... again ... that's not a threat is something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the\nThe uh George Bush comment and it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label them as insane\nIt if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't know what a a a ... what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now I'm [laughter] I'm I'm not sure what I mean [laughter] ah\nI I really don't know ah ah\nWell I think you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're

the Ninety percent tax I was at nine for you and one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and I\nThink the but [noise] if you\nLook at his demeanor in the way ... is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to him as like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because his demeanor was calm\nAnd straight to the point it wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment ah after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment\n\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love the uh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or\nYou know to the insane comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts wired to do the\nWires Khamenei Troy why is anybody surprise\nThat [noise]\nA ... a black

blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realized the ... now it's not the majority but it's growing ... and obviously when that message just put out to any demographic\nThat exist out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race somebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're All right let's just naturally going to happen\nAnd that's essentially the point that ... made on chemical you know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink\nI mean\nImagine Trump had said that [noise]\nIt would be done that not that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically it would be over
