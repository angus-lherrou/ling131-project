been someone claiming that about Obama and two thousand eight that it never would have something out of the day well ...\nWell you know it's coming out now is the leaks that completely anonymous yeah

have you paid attention to social media you can make these people\nDon't even use their real name on social media most often ... it just and and it's\nTo me and it shows you\nKnow that NBC don't ever

going in there that this person is walking back everything\nThat they say and you can't\nThat this person is walking back everything that they say ... ... and you can't find anybody to cooperate if you don't do with that story it's the same thing as I mentioned from my it was we talked about yesterday\nFrom Eric Brady at USA Today\nWhen he wrote will should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams dot until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source by the way just to note as I had set on yesterday show\nI I Know ... um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just so people know that\nIt's important to say that's what you're doing your blood people know that [noise] 'cause somebody might find out here and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young and you know we've kept in touch over the years just on Facebook\nA which is a space his Facebook vows to lead it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion\nThat credible evidence there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh it's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it has hit home with me\nThey are never going to\nGet on the brink here no no this is and and it won't end when Trump was no longer president this is not going to end you know because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls them out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating they admit\nThey can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview the story on the missile memo this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memo was released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now if Mitchell had reported that mind finding is that a judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court that would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News right\nNow if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news is that an all time low that's it nobody believes you and I see right through your\n...\nYour ... nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior\nSo stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right\n[noise] you're not even worthy of his recognition frankly because you're\nNothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part of the official process from the prosecutor gets zero time\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to your level right that'll really take 'em off ... well that that's in and that's what it's that's brick and that by the way\nComing from a guy who ... who has how many times that we sat on this program\nThere are times when somebody needs to just take the his Twitter account way for a few minutes and and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively ... says something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House had been horrible but that's how bad it went on NBC but it's all you don't hurt you shut it you have an\nEarned the right in him because it's also what you get from the left that well because of this presidents and there were changing the way that we do things that\nWe haven't we haven't show we don't care less active communication way we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama whether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together\nWith Clinton [laughter] whether whether it's a a Trump we don't care\nAnd I was and Dr Ford's claims and would you say the same thing the memo did not even that they completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to see what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here but well it's interesting because\nOne of one of the other stories that came out during the day on Monday is that you have the founder CNN Ted Turner that says the idea that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left\nAnd is the founder of the network and then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield ... uh who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN think that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump resistance ... ... ... we know this we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have\nOther people that were you know there before [noise] that can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's they're not journalists they instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a there they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis [noise]\nThat's the new word for opinion white opinion at the top\nYou have an opinion should be based on some well see why your hand analysis should\nBe here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion [noise] so if you're going to have\nAn opinion piece called opinion but you know what cats already out of the bag people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder
