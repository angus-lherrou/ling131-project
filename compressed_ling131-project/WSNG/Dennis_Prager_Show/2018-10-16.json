A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and ah I'm spoiled on my network other networks show people are ready to call them you foresee anything so feel free to do that you don't always have to wait\nLast night we talked about if you didn't hear it that we talked about the civil war we're now are experiencing in this country between the left and the right in my opinion for the soul of our country we also talked about how Justice Kennedy hearings were really not about his qualifications but a continuation\nOf that battle when when you understand that it puts it a little better prospect but didn't matter who President Trump was going to nominate they were against them in fact that if if you remember the placards of the protesters I don't even think they had a name on it I don't know if they had an ex or what they have\nBut it didn't matter it was all about making sure that the president couldn't appoint a ... his choice let alone a conservative\nAnd the chief aim of that battle is to remove President Trump from office\nThe left and the Democrats and the media that's all the same as I pointed out before never accepted his victory\nAnd they're doing everything possible to undermine that that seems pretty obvious\nSo in this segment I Want to talk about what I said this last night what a great job President Trump's done during his time in office despite the best efforts of the left and I've set for months now I could care less about what he says\nAnd much more than what he does and in fact that's I guess it makes me behavior list that's how I feel about people\nYou know they they may say awful things about you or to others but if they treat you well\nPoliticians typically talked our adversaries that's not a big deal to talk to them\nMay have talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things will be better when he got re elected that'd get you know make more stuff happened I've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general\nAnd disappointed is lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSession should have made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened congressional staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they helped their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude\nAbout corruption and his agency that amazes me\nAnd this is all gotten way out of hand and it is clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime if anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... of our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and\nI'm not sure until all the dust settles as my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWe are never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win right her champagne and our celebration there was a big boats the celebration supposed to happen in New York City\nThere were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all that would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be dream by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again it's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free the American people from this distraction\nIt is time to free all the defendant smaller so far named in this witch hunt like Michael Flynn that never should have happened either you know he was being under investigation I don't think at the time\nIt's all part of the resistance and Scott and\nLet me tell ya and I I Want to go on but I Want to get your calls what I thought about President Obama we never

well how you do\nA good point I just wanted to make is that you mentioned about all the good that a commander in chief was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with one of the build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings\nI think a lot of times we can see with the ah the recent\nInterview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady that we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values appointees Supreme Court justice is like you were a\nNote in about a Gorsuch Kavanaugh\nWhat is something that uh you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out you know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her\nHer personal server and breaking that sort of a security well in that regard being\nPart of the deep state having someone\nWas something that you see might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight in the in the upcoming election\nWell I'll tell you what's going to be the next battle and I'll see her last night we may very well I Hope we don't and people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist that we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on and so on and I know some races here in California that I never thought what happened like Dana Rohrabacher I mention his name and I know him\nAnd he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back\nThe house Jake you're going to see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you want to see the attempt to impeach President Trump and Kevin off\nAnd make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have and we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake and now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWe've seen the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the area of western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain\nHas moved off to the east and\nWarmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those looks down through the architects region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael not necessarily going to be associated with any rain from this front but could see a pop up shower or to\nAnd I have to wonder that\nWell why are you talking about later probably well I'm very disappointed and Jeff Sessions he showed no got snow no ... or ... what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who would give their life up for them\nOr she is and what what you did the\n... and you know and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word despicable wars Hillary puts it a weed deplorable a you know it it it is\nYou have to be totally blind or just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts and look up part of this country is falling in eight years we had we had a leader previous so our president so called president\nTake this country down and I believe he set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years a pie but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me\nAre always assuming that you know that what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands\nUp don't shoot all of a sudden I got to be believed yeah Michael Michael and he sent it back and a lot of people who voted\nFor him because he was black think hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet he he ... you're right I think it's worse now ... you know I had a mosque in this country is is worse since he was president\nYou know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown incident for just one was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of as the events happened as everything\nOr the Michael Brown incident ...\nWho's a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of ... as the events happened as everything went down he walked into as I recall that can be a convenience store you push the owner around the store they had done in the store\nKnocked the attended down walked out with a bunch of goodies and then went on down the middle of the street looking for trouble with the guy was wired for sound so\nAnd some minority it only as minority leader\nSays the said it was the way the police officers simply look you're right on all counts or member Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country have a I have a friend on radio news said measure if you sent your wife when we got married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the Ferguson is so that\nIt didn't take very long for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... a Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take ... was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to ... to to to to to stir up the hate and discontent as usual and you know the what the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and gone into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nYou know you better\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop but they keep talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen\nTo make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have their nose or they said it\nIt triggered a point that that I think is very good on your side the less just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing\nRight the the collusion with the Russians and what what are we waste two years on this stuff or you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into the global warming there right although uh it became climate change always from crisis to crisis the world is falling apart but you as you said you got a\nPresident now who's not let him get away with is in fact my loved what he said the minority community he said what do you have to lose about what's been going on in the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win\nThat election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people listening will agree with us maybe maybe I Am wrong\nI've been known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of them a smoke them off the stage basically you know and there was this guy has so\nBasic political affiliations he had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people respect the fact that finally\nYou got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts over the top sometimes you know I Wish he didn't say some of the things on you know rice on all things on Twitter that he does\nAnd I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I just listen to it gave a partial list and far better than George W. Bush and in certain ways and compete to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he's he's done so much he doesn't even get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done\nAnd as I say I don't care what he says I care what he does\nYou know Rob I'm I'm just thinking about a on a personal basis what kind of surge and do you want someone who does a great job for you or someone you know has a great disposition ... ideally you want both but the guy's been terrific in office and\nI think he's grown into it even better than I expected um and here's someone else who agrees but I'd go to disagree to mark his in broad run Virginia Iran with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm here thank you more\nAnd um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess he did not needed at all he was already a billionaire he was an elite is he he could have sat out there\nAnd I'm not worried about anything he worried about the people of this country\nAnd the direction this country was going they were going down a socialist path\nThey were going down for you\nAnd the direction this country was going they were going down a socialist path they were going down where you are going down the wrong path\nAnd he pulled us out he grabbed us and told us out\nAnd do all left is going crazy right and he is right when he goes to the uh [noise]\nYou know campaign thing where he is talking is absolute truth look I grew up in a democratic\nHousehold I mean lifelong Democrats\nOnly time my mother switched was well she voted for Nixon back in the ... because of the energy that's going on and now we've got an archeologist in all ...\nYou know capitalism socialism could\nI got kids in college that I agree with socialism that you've heard that ... it's in college now is that oh should list them is good capitalism is bad and\nAh we have to change the system hey we're not a racist country we elected Donald Trump I go to a black church I'm a white man you know\nAnd really the Bible teacher to\nThe [noise] the preacher and his wife and most of the other you know or or Democrats well they're all Democrats okay wait\nUs wrap it up for it go ahead\nGo ahead\nOh I was just going to say I appreciate your call just because we got to go to the break but uh you know I even love his style ... President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top or as we said you know as a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought the would ever say something right he's a character but he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait\nFor him to be re elected as a ... although I shouldn't say that you can you imagine the reaction I'm Talking about the left and the resistance because they're trying to get rid of them right now that's why the young men of called me at the beginning they are saying that when they expect is going to be the worst part the next two years I'll tell you what the worst part is if you guys don't go out there and vote\nAnd the Democrats win the house the Kavanaugh hearings are going to be nothing compared to what they do the next two years that's my biggest fear and that's when we got to work on and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine seven three three three nine mark nicer filling in on red eye radio", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Torrington", "day": "16"}
