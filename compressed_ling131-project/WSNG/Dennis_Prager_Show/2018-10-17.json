L. dot com so tonight there there are a lot of news stories I Want to talk to you about but one of the things which ties into the other nights is and the Democrats are made it very clear\nThat they're poised to draft articles of impeachment with the Washington Post ABC reporting that nearly fifty percent of Americans support immediate impeachment here and so of course we got to take these polls lightly we know her all the polls were last time I think there are only two that predicted President Trump would win and become president\nSo they're trying to keep the somewhat under the radar because they know many moderate and conservative voters would vote against their candidates if they knew what they were up to if they knew as I pointed out the next two years of going to be chaos\nIf they win the house of representatives subpoena power a hearings impeachment hearings they'll start on after Trump you know of course they're going to go for taxes they'll go to get Kevin on it's gonna be a disaster if they win and ...\nYou may remember this minority leader Schumer during a parade he denied that this is what he thought he was asked talking about impeachment when he said the sooner the better later on in all I thought they were asked me when we'd get rid of a Trump and minority\nLeader plus they said it's not a priority now unless something else comes forward but of course Maxine Waters has no such restraints polling continuously for the impeachment uh forty five she thinks that's a\nGenius line 'cause that's about all if you know Maxine Waters I Know of her and I met her that's that's about her intelligence level is that is a he or she can go\nThink they're all wasting their time they're delusional President Trump is going to be reelected they're going to be so surprised but again if they get the publicity the name recognition in the tower that all that stuff goes to the heads let me know what you think it's more faster sitting in a read on the radio\n[noise] eight six six ...

let's go to Michael in Washington DC Michael you're on with mark\nHey mark it's a pleasure\nThank you\nYeah it's a I got something that short and usually just a presidential candidate Trump said something to that bait and my wife and me both really happy with the season's greetings merry Christmas\nYeah no I agree totally when a when at that time I mean I said everybody merry Christmas yeah\nYeah I mean that right off the bat that I didn't do any better than it did it came out and said I don't believe in wanting to go correct yes I mean you can't beat it you\nKnow what I mean the ... through yeah go ahead\nYes I mean you can't beat it you\nKnow what I mean you're on through yeah go ahead\nNo I said oh that's that's all I got to face story sweet you know uh uh that that can\nBe yeah that is American or what I was going to say in response to what what you said\nIs that I Love saying merry Christmas to people and often you disarm them and you know they they'll say back to merry Christmas right but they've been so train now it's not just merry Christmas the whole as you said the whole politically correct movement which is you got to be so careful what you say in what you do um I teach part time which I think I've mentioned a number of times and\nThe ... the principal one day I said oh what a nice dress I thought\n... Picchu step and it's like Elizabeth Warren did you say something you know that's going to get you in big trouble look where we've come a when I first started teaching I now I teach adults but I\nTaught elementary school and in those days you get a hug a kid you know it didn't mean anything you know special I we played a lot of sports together\nAt these days you can't do any of that in fact\nYou cannot be alone in a room with the females or the door has to be wide open a female student I'm not sure about the students I think the same rules apply can you imagine that\nYou you've got to be so concerned about and this relates to what we've been talking about that someone will accuse you of something that you didn't do and and their teachers all the time accused the things that they\nDidn't do we call in Los Angeles the rubber room the good news they get paid the same amount so they sit around for months they sit around for years is the bad news you can get rid of a bad teacher if they did do something bad\nBut if they didn't you can be accused of anything and everything and it\nHappens all the time and where do you go as I said the other night where do you go to get your reputation back\nThis this whole politically correct movement is as Trump's that he's not going to be politically correct to me it's thanks it's just as American a better place I don't think so let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye and the same number eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nNow your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible and the central part of the states with re precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains into the southern Rockies under persistent clouds and precept\nThe justice thank God for this kind of his teeth\nBut then he became just as I think the the left and the media are crying over this as much as they were crying and two thousand sixty when Trump won but it's like people are absolutely petrified also in American and Israeli following politics in both countries very closely\nThe left always the right let me put it this way the right always does three to six percent better than the prediction is Ninety eight percent\nIt's not a hundred percent always like in in Israel that terrorists labor was getting the same thing because the media is extremely left in America like Ninety six percent\nOr something like that the same thing goes is true in Israel and there's no question we're going to win but what cabin on over here you have Eric Eric's I think his name is on his block they have a bread Stevens from the New York times used to\nRide in the wall Street Journal and other you know Trump or his no Trump absolutely not they switch that saying we're going to vote for Trump because they're always got open\nSo there's no way in the world from I ... I mean I don't know what's gonna happen from the outfield then God Forbid that can be something negative about Trump I don't know what can happen\nBy those things the way they are now we're going to win big there's no question about the house is tricky but we're going to win that keep the house\nDefinitely going to get fifty five more also most people are probably not aware of this in the Senate there's twenty four I think I'm a ... at twenty four Republicans the Democrats are running\nAnd nine I think I'm Republicans if you're running you can lose your seats so they have a bigger chance of losing their seats and they're gonna lose in two years we're in trouble because the other way around but anyways that's interesting for no\nCharles you are you are very good not just because you have some nice things about me so I Want to react to it to have a dialogue with your your good [noise]\nCharles you are you are\nVery good not just because you have some nice things about me so I Want to react to it to have a dialogue with your your good um we had a lot of\nTalk yesterday about this kinda stuff uh especially with the signs people saying they were afraid of course to have a Trump sign in the yard or let alone or on your car because they'll get keys I live in California that there's ... there's no hope actually here in New York City since\nI live in New York started to run up I left you just like your own maybe\nA ... so yeah I don't know but you may be worse but I yesterday I got more optimism in terms of the house because a lot of people felt like you did that we could win the house but you were the rejoined yours I mentioned his race cars I Know him pretty well Dana Rohrabacher who's been there Twenty years and\nIn orange county which used to be the bastion of conservatism in in California it's not anymore and they're pouring in so much money and the other side that\nI Know people know him much better than I Do or close to him and he he's worried so houses you know their individual races their individual elections across the country and you're right the experts say that the Republican side is going to lose the house and then they may not be the blue wave they're talking\nAbout but I'm concerned but cautiously optimistic\nAnd maybe it'll be very tight and we'll still when the house you're definitely right that you're not\nTelling you first of all people are are absolutely nuts about Trump as I Am\nWhite people said about George W W like this on these a murderer alert orange alert or he didn't respond we would all go crazy and it's about damage\nAnd the Republicans finally also caught on all of a sudden I understand yesterday McConnell and got a standing ovation the head of the Senate yeah nobody would you like them because they don't fight back there were afraid to be weird they don't defend that other guy Republican get smeared\nBecause they're afraid they're going to be next to Republicans emotion that up in the same page Democrats have the same talking points build say the exact same thing\nOne after the other together with the media but Trump fights back the Senate either it doesn't give a damn about political correctness you said earlier you have to be careful you can be careful what's kosher yesterday what was your today whatever you say they're really sick like Michael Savage\nAlways says you know it's a mental disease so they're literally to ask a five year old girl if you're a boy or girl ... ... it's like that I I don't know if I'm living in the country it's like the Democrats are normal people kept JFK Kennedy or a Democrat who those days\nWell housing for Democrats today's different Democrat if you're a Democrat who no chance and they're all\nThey're actually uh it it will be holding not not the right word in other words the extreme left of the party that twenty five percent of the Democratic party that's very left I should ... threatening that the others have to go along with them the forest to become let's\nListen to Cory Booker Booker Spartacus ride all these guys I mean they're all insane because they have to elect Feinstein had to pull you polled with Kevin Wilk thank God that you did\nBecause she's running against I Believe somebody that's so left that climate or not left enough\nYou know and my other shit on the other on the other show that I feel in foreign case like I mentioned that uh in California\nI'm urging people to vote against Feinstein\nEven though the guys for the left because she's got some consequences which he did when she did was outrageous you know she used to be the so called more moderate than Barbara Boxer you should have gone off the deep end now that the whole thing with a letter and cabinet that that was outrageous before\nI let you go I Want you to tell me which Democrat you'd like to see run against a President Trump\nAgainst drop it doesn't make a difference if there's nobody there they're all like the generic as [laughter] as you were there I mean\nIt's like a Bernie it'd be like what Seventy five Seventy six and a blocking out the vice President Biden job are going to be one Seventy four Seventy five that they don't have a bench because\nThey look around with ... sorry and Kamala Harris and Cory Booker that got some young people there Eric Garner city okay Dan\nTrue that's true but but I don't think I have a chance in hell it can against Trump film has something I've never seen anyone ever had yeah as a a hunch but he's right like maybe eight percent of the time he just sees in advance I I don't I've never seen such a thing\nAs like let's say the football thing you know with the kneeling to print it get whatever his name is\nRight a lot of right wing is ... shows will say why would you have to start off with him he knew he was going to win how did he know that you know all of a sudden\nThe NFL or whatever lost a lot of money people weren't going how Trump no it's worth starting defied okay first of all he's a real patriots and he didn't like what they were doing but somehow he just\nHow did he know Nikki Haley God Bless her\nWell no it's starting that's okay but the real Adrian didn't like what they were doing but somehow he just\nHow did he know Nikki Haley God Bless her I Wish you would she would stay for another two years in law really the governor of South Carolina ship no I Believe no experience in foreign policy none none while you're right you're right you're right there ... phenomenal I mean you can still use\nNobody can I don't see how anybody is how I I mean even what's his name on national security advisor a boat but he's been tested but his mentor Nikki Haley what she did she turned over the whole damn thing got much how Charles don't know that you'd be great I have no idea\nWell I I kind of say the Charles you very you're very articulate you're very good just don't you know challenge me to be a talk show host sounds like you're good enough to do that Thanks Charles oh if she was doing\n[laughter] your delight thanks so much Charles you have a great night and a look you know it didn't matter\nThat he said very good things about and that's how I kept them on and so on well you got to think about that but I Want to know you think and\nAnd you know we'll take your calls on whatever topic you want to talk about that\nIn the news and I'm going to for a lot of topics out bought\nA let me know what you think of which of these presidential candidate he may be right I I think he's right Charles I don't think it matters I think President Trump I Want you Democrats out there especially to call me I tell me why President Trump is not going to when we had people last night who called and said you know we were crazy\nWith cabin on and some other uh things around that\nUh tell me why I'll treat you very well I'm I'm very good that way I Want to hear what you have to say in the you know tell me least why you think President Trump is going to lose and
