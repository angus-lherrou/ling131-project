or\nWhatever [noise]\nHuh All right we can get your calls if you want to hear me talk about it well let's begin in this segment by playing rational sound here is representative Louie Gohmert on the migrants invasion in ... number one on the Savage Nation\nThe president made no bones about it and uh\nUh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think sixteen after ... gangs came across the border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people\nAre not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border\nBut a a sense you know pushing into Mexico now President Trump's I'm going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to be stopped\nNow we hear the president himself talking about who's funding this clip to on the Savage Nation\nAnd our starting to find out and I won't say it a hundred percent I put a little tiny question mark at the end and a lot of money has been passing\nThrough people to come up and try and get the border by election day because they think that's a negative for us number one they're being stopped and number two regardless that's our issue\n... they're being stopped well how President Trump we're behind you on this make no mistake about it we back you on this end by the way most Democrats back you want us to get the leadership they don't back anything except anything that's stabbed us in the back\nHow you're going to stop them well this is from an earlier speech a week ago but listen to number three and see what he said last week\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border if this is a top because of the illegal immigration onslaught brought\nThe Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws they like it they also figure everybody coming is going to vote Democrat you know hey [noise]\nThey're not some stupid when you think about it right\n[noise] but they are crazy in the crazy Democrat\nRefused to support any harm of voters security legislation defects our absolutely horrible all fashion loophole ridden immigration laws\nOkay good that's good talk but now we need action\nA man of action he's built buildings all over the world he's not just a man of talk he's a man of action that's why we loved him and we want action we we love to talk now we need the walk\nAnd so what's the walk and to be you're an hour an advisor to the president you the restaurant owner\nYou the Baker of wedding cakes you the mechanic use a retired housewife\nYou the officer of the law who sees every day what these people go to this country you the people running poverty programs who know that there's limited amounts of money you the nurses you the doctors tell me what you would do if you are on President Trump's advisory board\nAnd he listened to us that are listening to news men around the commentators at Fox News almost exclusive to everyone else how is that possible how can you run a government listening only the people on Fox News let's say they're nice people they're good people that smart people are they the best people in the smartest people on the planet\nThey know more than everyone on the planet because they're on Fox News when the camera and they're All right 'cause they're not pro and make them and make a tie and read a script\nThe smartest people on the planet they know more than everyone on the planet because they're on Fox News with a camera and they're All right because then I put on makeup and make a tie and read a script\nI don't think that the smartest people on the planet I didn't say that the stupidest though the worst but I Would say amongst many there are some there may be others with better ideas\nAnd so what are your ideas you you now have a chance on the Savage Nation the coldest show and be heard by a lot of people I don't know the numbers that doesn't really matter and remember your your comment is like a pebble in a quiet pond\nAnd it'll spread like ripples throughout the landscape what would you advise to stop this human ah assault well there are no better ideas and the ones I've given but maybe you think you have a better idea of what what is your idea though\nJames on chaos info you say it's a negative to put the military why\nWell I'm retired police as Dr Savage I really feel served about putting ...\nBecause are they going to arm the military which they should be and ... really think there would be a national incidents I mean ... ...\nOh no you're a thousand percent right because the the Hondurans Guatemalans than all Salvadorans will provoke an incident to get shot they won gunfire into the crowd\nThey should\nHire more border patrol and specifically place him on the border instead of you know driving around and stuff but I really think that\nWell I think that it's I think once they get to the border it's over the game as came over they need to be stopped in Mexico so the pressure has to be part of the Mexican government to use their military their police there federal ice or\nWhatever they have to use to build a barricade that they cannot cross when that barricade his armored cars police cars it doesn't matter what the barricade consists of they must create a temporary barricade that cannot be crushed by anyone and they must funneled is this human wave into a narrow area that can be contained\n... the United states somehow have said that the government to control it I think that's a thought ... I really don't think we should put\nOur well you're right in the first of all the military is not designed really for a non combat situations unfortunately has been turned into a they've been turned into police in too many actions but they are trained to take on enemies and kill them not trained really to stand there\nI mean let let's open a training a military how do we how do we win battles in Iraq for example or Afghanistan or right now in Syria wherever the battles going on you you have met or aggressive will go into battle to charge the other main and destroy them that's what the military is trained to do not to act as international not not the act like the un\nOh let's call out the UN the useless un where is the un now that we need them those bombs sucking on dry those ... those bombs\nI'm not\nThat that's an end joke sorry about that now where are the ... and the bumps in the UN why don't they send the UN to our border to protect us you and You're Joking you know what those initial stand for don't you start a family show\nOkay let's take some more calls KB why our radio Kato line nine or ... what is your solution\nFor among a practice on ivy cargo ships or something that I've seen videos on them I mean there are strengthening demanding aggressive grass in the back\nRow they look like very weak downtrodden people who are in need of help would they look like strapping young men\nOr they got close on fresh American von\n... year where they get the new sneakers and new shirts and the clean clothing ... who's doing the laundry for them\nThe Catholic social services\nOh my goodness we finally had bingo we had we had gold\nYeah the good friend of Michael Morris the pope\nIs the Catholic Church that lives off this this is one of the number one cash cows for the Catholic Church is illegal immigration did you do know that right\nYeah and then you then you look at all the fuse that are sitting empty and America with those nice beautiful but buildings the American stopped going they're not buying that movie anymore so what better way to fill up the abuse them with people from the third world who still believe in the act\nAnd so what you do as you get you know they're very smart you got to hand it to the Vatican they get billions of dollars from the U.S government to destroy the U.S government it's incredibly smart you know you really have to be close to God to figure something like that out must take a break\n...
