Hill who said that uh\nWe should normalize safely could go over that what he was trying to essentially what it is the new norm shouldn't be that we need armed guards in a synagogue but like we gave up on those rights\nGoing onto an airplane we need to be searched ... check and in Israel where every single synagogue in school as an armed guard that's how reality and it's especially rich coming from him to say that we don't need armed guards when we have the most restrictive gun laws that were not allowed to bring the legally life will probably have in our homes and there are many of us that do we can't bring it on\nIf I'm not mistaken the blast your surrounded by armed guards isn't he\nOf course and ...\nAnd didn't it didn't blast you'll put armed guards in front of a mosque during his tenure as mayor\nAnd it just yesterday they were pictures they'll have only on New York city Hercules teams protecting fainted on why after that that might not be for the fact\nHe just said that we shouldn't have armed guards we don't need them I came out immediately and said you know I don't want to go back to the statement of every July twenty two you know who said that many years ago\nWhen that guy that you know what he was wrong with that one from the side of the caliber\nVery funny well how does the orthodox Jewish community feel about guns\nFall I Can't speak for everyone I could speak for myself and my friends and the majority of us are both license and carry on practice regularly see\nNow that's such an odd I'm verse view of the religious Jew\nFire and it's something that I heard you say last week and I wanted to call in and speak about that but um there are many like me and many of us are well trained and while on um itself the licensing and the and the bureaucracy that makes it difficult to obtain them\nWell I'm Glad that you can protect your women and children in a synagogue because\nOf the life ... and the and the bureaucracy that makes it difficult to obtain them\nWell I'm Glad that you can protect your women and children in a synagogue because you\nKnow a ultimately the the the congregation as to learn to protect itself\nWould that this year we can't we're not allowed to like tell me carrying our homes we can bring to our ...\nWhat it was so protects your who who protects you during service\nNobody thought unfortunately and that's not enough when\nYou know I as we learn that's not enough obviously well I I Want you to do something for me which part of what are you a member of ...\nI Am [noise] can you please get their mailing list and tell them that as of January they're not going to hear Michael Savage I'm WABC but that if they want to hear me they're going to have to stream the show and get the podcast for free five or you say that well I\nHave to be clear about it I'm not saying why am I saying how this is the way it is I have an audience in the millions across the country and its enormous to New York city\nBut for reasons people can figure out they're going to have to carry me on the streaming come January but it's free and easy to teach them how to do with thank you for calling should've sent them stop mass hysteria but then they'll say oh\nYou're being self serving by mentioning your book or this is my book and it's a prophetic book what should I Do make believe it is and\nWhat do you think he's a throwaway book like at the wrote a piece of direct that most people right today garbage I'm reading the first line tell me if there's anything is going anywhere out there and I'll tell you what I'll go by one hatred is in the air\nWe're living in an age of hay and which mental pollution is worse than air pollution the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying agents hatred is spreading like a virus into all too willing hosts\nHatred of conservatives hatred of trumping as voters is just one of many cases of mass\nHysteria infecting American society today\nBut it is likely the most destructive\nThe book came out a few weeks ago if there's anything more prophetic in the marketplace I haven't seen it\nBut it goes past this event and I'm not going to talk about the book I'm reading my own words because if I don't read them who will you know nobody will I have only this outward nothing else\nSo let's go to the Mad Men if you want to let's go somewhere else if you want Pittsburgh synagogue suspect called the highest is work sugar coated evil sugarcoat an evil\n... how did he come to know about highest number one and what did these poor victims who were massacres of anything to do with highest of anything\nThat's two separate questions it's an international group it's not even headquartered in Pittsburgh it's based in silver springs Marilyn Marilyn now when a challenge to the travel ban against Muslims reached the Supreme Court last year\nThis group high us and its president CEO Mark Hatfield denounced what he saw as a policy of turning away Muslim immigrants just for being Muslim\n\nAnd then he went to the tower I missed the Hatfield and went into the whole story about the toll road and so we attack Donald Trump this man apparently\nSaw that [noise]\nAnd he made the wrong connections in his brain and this not picked on this poor synagogue this congregation synagogue in Pittsburgh so\nHow do you stop this from happening again\nYou can scream white nationalist thought he won tonight on the Upper East side of New York you could have your coffee clashes your latte clashes\nAnd you could say [noise] I Wish those white those white nationalist [noise] you can click your tongues all you want but if you bring in thirty million illegal immigrants over a twenty year period\nAnd there were over thirty million guns in the hands of Americans and you don't understand this is they tend to box that is about to explode and you can't put two and two together that those on the bottom are the ones most threatened\nBy this latest wave what they see as an army
