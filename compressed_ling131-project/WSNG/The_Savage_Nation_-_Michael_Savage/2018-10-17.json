of the oval office\nWould the liberal media pay attention to Mozart in the White House ...\nThere aren't that many classical music lovers so therefore Mossad as irrelevant and that's\nThe world we live against so if I wake up in the morning and I play certain music it's not only classical don't get me wrong I mean I've known for listening to jazz rock and roll you name it\nBut if I if I really can't if I don't really feel good I play classical music because it humbled me to the point where I Am a breakdown inside saying that's impossible at a human being could have lived on this Earth like Mozart\nAnd had a brain that was like that that can conceive music like that to me it's is as close as you're ever going to get to God and it goes back to the fact that there are differences between people and unfortunately for us we're living in a time where everyone thinks they're equal to everyone else because of social media that's the tragic truth\nIf you saw the kind of idiots who are on Twitter or on Facebook who comment on things they know nothing about but because they can fire up a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientist on earth in fact they're better\nAnd this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and it levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a moron in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher at having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd makes the clash pay attention to him because he's got a big mouth and interrupts the teacher so no one learns anything trust me I Know what it's like to be a teacher\nI notice like that really gets in the classroom will disrupt the class but because of the breakdown of our society and all standards at all forms in every aspect of our lives no one knows what's right or wrong anymore very few people do anyway they don't know north from South east from west truth from fall so\nGood from bad and so therefore if you go on the social media anymore on to take a picture of themselves and now they're more famous than the ...\nPeople probably know strip for more than they do Albert Einstein I Would say that um the stripper who's attacking Donald Trump\nIs better known today than let's say Martha Washington or something like that\nYou you you see where I'm coming from so anyway to make a long story short so I'm I'm listening to Lou Gehrig sorry I'm listening to the Mozart and I see the article led Stephen Hawking ... the guy in a wheelchair very tragic don't get me wrong I'm not mocking his disease it's very tragic disease\nBut it does not make him the genius on every subject on the planet including the kicking the guts today he said at his last book that we just got a glimpse at that I there is no God well I don't get what he said\nHe's one of billions of people said said something about God why why is his statement I got more than the next guy it isn't but because he was a darling of the American left media suddenly because he said there is no God now all of a sudden that's a big deal\nNow I understand that there's not I don't understand anything that's all I Want to say so I tried to tell you something about cycads say go palm\nThe moral population the relationship to blue green algae and micro toxins that are found an algae and lakes and ponds and rivers and things like that and how it might produce nerve toxins that are related to I'll have something like that but it's a long topic for another day maybe I'll do it on my part cast you know what I'm saying\nA come January this is a topic I could do for three days health I made to a regular house segment where I don't have time to do it on TALK radio because she could get you know you got a different format it's like the way this commercial radio you got it you got to interrupt in order to support your show you need to advertisers let's be clear\nIt's a different story with a park yes you've got a chance to expound in a little more adept with a little more you know inside\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining I'm just saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world and we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in\nBecause I Would instead immediately shift to the word immigration immigration immigration immigration Honduras you'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should be because as I said today\nWhat's going on in this country right now with immigration as a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years and I try to public\nYou want in this country right now with immigration as a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years and I tried to publish a book right after I got my doctorate in Nineteen Seventy nine eighty called immigrants and epidemics\nIs after had had six books published already\nAnd my co author was the dean of the school of public health brilliant man and nobody in New York was touched the book for political reasons that was then you understand how how much worse it's gotten here today\nIt's gotten worse here today than it was then it's a miracle that I'm Still on the radio but I won't be here in January on some major stations even though my ratings were higher than anyone else on the station because of political reasons only make no mistake about it joy ...\nColeman five four of us [laughter] if\nA very primitive order we're not giving them a a three level a three bedroom two bath color television house basic barracks like your soldiers living\nAnd they'll get much better care and they do in Honduras and then when they are better send them home that simple the world has to understand that no first rate nation can take it all the world's poor it's impossible now that's what the communist would like you to believe that we should all share everything\nI Would say start with Bernie Sanders million dollars last year let 'em give it away then I Believe ... says the day Bernie Sanders gives away the money he's making on his communism that they believe award any of them say but again okay so what's this rare polio like illness where is it coming from a FM you have to dig very hard to get any answers on this at all\nBecause it's very serious that could lead to paralysis in deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota announced the six children contracted a FM acute flash at ... which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating this increasing they FM which begin twenty four team but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC I'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know\nWhat kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there but you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses so every every article says the causes the bay of them are still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't know anything but it's the one today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh it may be a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses and that'll viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM we're the west Nile virus come from the west dial it doesn't say New York virus does it in the west Nile virus when it come from\nOr where you can pretty much see what I'm going with this right well you understand what I what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came your great grandfather\nWhen anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading it into the healthy population but those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine anyone no matter what disease they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population is an increased risk of diseases like this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a diseased parts of the country\nAnd common sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco and San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were\nThey raise them in a kiss them on the lips the show it good good people they are that's how sick they are but if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick [noise] so what I'm saying to you there's a relationship\nBetween some immigrants from some countries on some diseases and if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union\nMember I told you run into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary if so shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the ex Soviet Union and she said people are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet\n... under Soviet rule I was stunned by it you were more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and there was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because\nThe other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communist left\nThey're afraid to say one word at work ... there'll be fired\nAfraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner\nIn more fear the ... the Soviet era in America today yeah okay well what can you do which is one man one man against the world shoveling against the tide is very very difficult odds here\nI write the book stop mass hysteria\nAmerica's and sadly from the sandwich rouse the Trump which is doing well but not great if not doing as good as the comic books\nAnd the comic books not as good as the comic books on the left and the comic books on the right people want simple books and simple ideas they don't want to read they don't want to think they don't want history all they want a polemic ... I'm not complaining it's the marketplace let the marketplace determine\nThere's nothing I can do about it I tried something new I went from politics to a history and people were not really ... I don't know where the books are going to be on the list if it's even on the list after a week on I don't know whether you bought the book he doesn't buy the book all\nI Know is it went to my local bookstore Barnes and noble they said they sold it out so whether that'll indicate the country is ready to read something serious instead of a comic book or a comic book I don't know but unless you have a television show\nOn Fox News in particular and or you are lauded by the mainstream media\nAs a genius and you have no television or radio show but you're on every show in the country books have a very very very hard chance to ever get into the public eye those are the odds that like I Love and I've always like to swim against the tide I've always like loving love swimming up up river\nAnd I'm reaching a poor I don't know if I Want to do it anymore I Know it's an odd time to tell you about all this stuff but it's already almost November I launched the book\nI'm coming to the end of this cycle in radio and the media I've told you I Would never do another political book\nAlthough I'm being asked already please do one more on the presidential you can't leave us because the presidential elections coming up to twenty twenty police average just hang in there for one more cycle I'm not so sure I Want to do it and I don't want to talk much more about it right now because you're going to tell them I don't leave us in\nThat kind of I don't want to do the old Mike don't leave us I'm not trying to get you to do anything or say don't but truthfully\nMaybe it's time for me to do with Johnny Carson is what I'm thinking as you know here's the funny part about how I work when thoughts start to flood up in my brain for my subconscious I listen to them I can only repressed thoughts for so long\nAnd sometimes you got to listen to your inner inner right now to listen to the old dinner\nAnd I'm reaching that point well like what is it really matter what is it really matter if I have to do this until I drop dead on the radio\nI went to dinner last night with someone who wants to give me a television show actually I don't want to talk about it was real did so well you know there's someone in the media was eighty four years old who said he's never going to stop to lease till he dies I said well I don't know that's great I is that noble\n... there's something no less ain't gonna work to drop dead like a horse and I you know they shoe horses don't remember what do you dance at a dance for until you drop dead\nOr is there more nobility and leaving at the height of your career at the top of your career I'm walking out and that's the end of it these are the questions that are that are really I'm thinking about it but he is the problem I'm drifting in from disease to this\nIs the problem with that thinking I don't have any hobbies not really I mean I collect old cars would have to old jaguars I don't drive them that much like a center in the garage and touch the carburetors you know\nUh I don't do anything I really like outside already oh this is what I really loved doing that's the problem I've given my heart and my soul to this for a quarter of a century I

on it\nAnd it's interesting to me what people respond to one on Twitter or on the radio show or on my Web site\nLast night I went to the city I had a business meeting so I chose to ... it was an fisherman's Wharf I I Know the owners they treat me really well people think it's a tourist trap down there but I can be ... but when you go in there and you're treated like family is different so\nI posted a picture of me with a martini my hand no vermouth please toxic\nAnd my book stop mass hysteria next to me on the table and you know I got as much response to that as I did on on some intel intellectual a subject that I post on ... on the couch where they were like pictures I like to take pictures of me with a like a drink in my hand I become one of my favorite things to talk to manage\nThe camera in the right hand now the drink and the left and the table if the light is just right it's a beautiful picture\nThe light was really good here coming through the olive and the uh the the green thing floating in there as a piece I did a double alignment and olive I generally do not use any what do they call it fruit and we'd like fruit and your drink generally no I never let any of those stuff going on because they touch it with their hands idle whether you know what I'm saying\nAnd I don't know do not know fruits or you don't mind on food I'll go to a fruit stand but I there's a piece of line is er I like to eat the olive after I drink to drink and then uh yeah you watch the sun goes down over the Golden Gate bridge and you look at the mystery and beauty of the

to\n[noise]\nDoesn't make sense I mean you have to be a genius to figure out what I just said I guess so today no one thinks they don't think look I exist in this business because of one reason a I'm offering you something that you're buying less policy that way and you don't you think about it\nWhen you really think about what us talk radio ... which talk radio shows are successful and which aren't which are long lasting and which aren't it's no longer related to um whether you survive in this business or not is no longer related to ratings for example on New York uh WABC I had the highest ratings for years I had any for three straight\nBut they want to go in another direction you won't hear me into your come January unless you\nEat a stream may or or for another station or you'll listen to my podcast my writings were great that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it there's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership\nOf stations do you understand that I don't own the stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing kazoo if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was and we're not going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse or the ...\nAnd you can say what do you want but you don't have any control over it doesn't matter if the show loses money\nDoesn't matter and all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when the gear they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\nSo the only reason you listen to me at all is why\nWell you figure this guy's a little different sometimes he comes down on this side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on a reason not just on on a a desire to please us any doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I did not Trump that I'm angry at it's the talk show hosts who thinks that that's all you want to hear that's the part that bothers me\nWhat would you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours\nIt's diluted how great Obama was Obama was there so but I'm always great Obama shoes showing ... probably than anyone shoe bomber was smarter how could you listen to that did you listen to it no no the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't know any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed their networks by running left wing propaganda are now running other media now that you know that even in radio well you're in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false\nI wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive it all in this business if you're a truth teller the people will find you one way or the other is that simple they'll find you on line or they'll find you\nOn a podcast or they'll strenuous from somewhere that's that's how it is so is that that's the way it is now ... what are we gonna talk about let's go I didn't take a call yet this is one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist by that one guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into one of the nuts and the crowd he was like one of the biggest star but he made a fortune became a top guy and sign that I was surprised he went so high up in this thing\nBut he wasn't like kids Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties and I'll wake up twenties ladies like one of the chief school rules in the Scientology movement but I remember the guy to a certain things you said it would really good I like about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me well really helped my migraines and self cure was reading Georgia showers and mackerel\nThe image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me bore really helped my migraines and self cure was reading Georgia showers and macro buyout accent I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and on my own I found out which which food types trigger migraines\nAnd I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that enjoy will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out with it so my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn too fast and burn up the seat there's great feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain on your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible\nBut and here's the but\nMost of us have lost contact with these signals we don't want to hear them we we've eliminated them we put ear buds in whatever what he would do so I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message\n[laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't want don't drink that rockets not good for you today whatever but I I listened very close relationship with\nSo I took these andme acrobatic diet didn't eliminate Sean sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer\nAnd heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want people do crazy things today based on on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio was I was able to use my my learning\nMy dissertation and going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study\nStudies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today\nAnd the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of allies I figure that'll be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to a habit of reading I don't know you could have turned off the list that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration upgraded is around the clock\nAnd bat\nThat part down in the middle of his hair you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy and become not so good looking and you're middle aged man wow I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy was like and not notice they had some I was okay\nI had my share of fun but what I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing on any no education and no no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and looked like a Lou Costello\nIn order to to cover up the defending hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole mask manhood thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president I'm Talking about people in the media they'll call your tiny that's nothing to do with anything where there were ... brains in what does everything have to be everything some people are in doubt mentally somewhere in doubt physically summer dad would vote someone dealt with nothing that's the human condition when he going to do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving based on your good looks you're a good guy looks and your hair starts to stand in your face start to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it I don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupt that you know I I don't I think God and his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about learning out there knows what I'm even talking about I Wonder sometimes I think there'll be like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening to me is that people have different cultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a\nYesterday I had the day off writes I go to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me so I went up and cello she's from Cambodia and she said to me very quietly she said\nI Lived through those camps that poll pie created my relatives were killed in them and lived through them and I was stunned here's a living woman who have you looked during the street would say she's ... she's a liberal than the Democrats are always thing that if someone's from Asia they were liberal or someone's\nAfrican American there were a liberal or someone's gay they're all you have no idea what a person's politics are really you can't tell by looking at people you you just can't you know that\nYeah well okay like some costs for example a die hard communist left us you wouldn't know that there are many in the military who you think would be normally conservative Republican they left wing comedies you wouldn't know that either so you can never judge a book by its cover I'll be back in a minute a joy\nI mean you wouldn't know that either so you can never judge a book by its cover I'll be back in a minute\nJoined us Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five four
