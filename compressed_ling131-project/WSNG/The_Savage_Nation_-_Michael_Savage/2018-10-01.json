listening to the show that will cost you actually nothing I Want you to if you treat now go to Twitter she might tweet from September twenty sevens which I tend to the top is Dr for deeply tied to the CIA with the connections I think are valid\nAnd a re tweet it and then let's see what happens and then I asked you why to liberal support their movement by consuming the lying books while our side sits on the sidelines who refuses to support independence like Savage as a listener\nAnd I say stop mass hysteria then I said do you believe finds thing\nI'm shocked that a woman with so many skeletons in her closet going back from the beginning would continue to be so belligerent at the kid didn't continue to go to Erica life she does\nI'll say that again I'm shocked\nThat a woman with so many skeletons in her closet would continue to go to America about capital and about Trump and the hearing without saying to yourself once wait a minute now I have a pretty good I've done real well why am I shaking the cage of all those who hate me\nWhy does she do this with impunity get anyone to answer this question because I have the answer because the republic\nIt was a show many years ago called the untouchable ... do you know that US Senators are the untouchable of our time did you know that\nDid you know the senators can virtually get away with almost anything did you know that\nDo you know that that horrible human being one of the lowest forms of womanhood to ever come out of God's earth Barbara Boxer had the nerve over the weekend to go on a show\nAnd say something I never thought anybody could say she said capital had the audacity and the nerve to speak so loudly to a senator\nShe thinks the senators are the closest thing to God\nWhy the senators have such power\nWhy do they have such broad power why are they like Roman senators before wrong collapsed my friends that question as the answer in it\nWhy are our senators are supposed to serve us equivalent to the Roman Senate and Roman senators before wrong collapsed if you've answered the question which is built into the question you know where we are in American history how close we are to dissolving as a republic\nBecause I personally do not think this country can survive much longer I I I really believe in in the bottom of at the bottom of it all this country is past that point when I wrote stop becoming civil war\nI Believe Feinstein triggered I think she is living Fort Sumter\nI think Dianne Feinstein is the Fort Sumter of our time in a dress Feinstein is Fort Sumter an address\nAnd I think that they may want it that's the part that is really starting to eat at me they may actually want it they may actually want the chaos of a civil war\nI was reading another book a history book not mine called the fall of Rome and the end of civilization by Brian Ward Perkins which I briefly referenced over the years on my show\nAnd there's a line of jumps out to me about the euro barbarian what happened to uh the invasion of Rome and how it collapsed as a result of the civilized Roman world collapsed because of the barbarians\nAnd ah he quotes a a French scholar name Andre ... who wrote about the flourishing Christian empire cold room at the door of dramatic tribes\nAnd how it achieved a remarkable feat of living for centuries Rome's frontiers without becoming civilized meaning or the dramatic tribes any close this book\nWith two sentences one is this Roman civilization did not pass peacefully away it was assassinated\nRoam\nRoam and civilization did not pass peacefully away it was assassinated\nI Believe Feinstein and the Democrats are the barbarians of our time who are so drunk on their own power that they were destroyed the republic to keep drinking in\nOn their power I Believe they are the hordes that we have the at all of our lives I Believe they are the barbarians of our time no not the illegal immigrants make no mistake about it they're just harmless numbers that are homeless but individually they're homeless by large I Am talking about the imperious\nRoman senators of our time who are the barbarians of our time who are assassinating America with their vial behavior\nAnd what I'm trying to do is awake in America to what is actually at stake and what is actually going on\nIf I say America is insanity from the Salem witch trials for the Trump which on you get that right away you understand that you know you don't have to have a PHD to follow that but you're saying what the heck can I Do about it knowledge is power never forget that knowledge is key to everything knowledge is power\nIf all the deplorable is in this country [noise]\nWhich really to understand the context of the Feinstein for mentality and understand it's not just the corrupt senator who is simply vying for more power\nTo bring down a guy like Kavanaugh and from that there's something even deeper involved which is literally the assassination of the nation itself [noise] then this half as America could stand up and save the country\nThe Savage Nation coal no eight five five for hundreds of hey you know it's not smart job sites it overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Savage she unlike other job site zip recruited doesn't wait for candidates\n... says yeah looking at it came down there who is among buying being with him and they ... not bear false witness against our neighbor [noise] now why would they have taught the the ancient olive growers now shall not bear false witness\nWhy would that have been a value that has been lost by Dianne Feinstein Dick Durban to name a few I can name all of them if you'd like all all ten of them\nHow come they didn't read the shot not bear false witness\nHow can they raise the debt why they're the same people are torn down the ten commandments across America they work with roof the girl ... Ginsberg to say that oh well those Christians can practice it in their own home\nBut those Ten Commandments have no business in a school room those Ten Commandments monuments don't belong anywhere in America tear him down and then tear down Columbus along with it tear all of America down to rebuild it in the name\nOf the municipal skirt\nThat's why because once you tear it down you can rebuild it in your own image and if you want to see what your own images go to Michael Savage dot com and see a picture of what went on in San Francisco over the weekend with people beating each other and with ... in public walking around naked having a poor psychological damage individual\nIndividuals dressed up as dogs cats\nAnd other animals on leashes in the streets or for all the children to see that's now that's a progressive view the Folsom Street parade that is a progressive things that ... she was proud of she said those are her values Feinstein approves of that\nShe approves of all these things this was in her backyard this is the wholesomeness of our time not those commandments put out by those old Jews in the desert no no it's whipping people in the streets of San Francisco punishing them with all sorts of things on their body dressing them up\nIn the most frightening costumes that you would see in a horror show all for the children to see\nIn ... San Francisco\nNow that's family values as practiced by a Feinstein it below sea here in San Francisco they themselves know practice it I mean they're old women you wouldn't expect in a five year old to get dressed up as a bear a dog or cat would you\nKnow but you can approve of such things\nIt's wholesome it's wholesome and it's it's just choice it's just freedom of choice of expression to beat someone up in the street like that\nAnd it doesn't lead to anything worse I mean it's consensual I mean you get a psychological damage individual you're telling me is a dog or lower than a dog and then you abused that person but that's wholesome in San Francisco\nThat's not abuse abuses capital having one too many beers in high school that now that\nSaid it was ... and never forget what abuses those beers did it it is\nMy only hope is that the ... the the union men or let me just dress only union men out there who are usually generally somewhat confused about things they do with their bosses tell him to do [noise]\nUnion men by and large they don't know what to do so when they vote they usually vote Democrat whether you noted on some of them moved over to Trump but many of them are still Democrats I only hope they understand what they have to do come November\nI just pray to God they understand that if they if they pulled a plunger on a day they may as well get a spate on an ... an open grave for their son\n'cause they're burying masculinity by voting against their own survival it's that\nSerious the insanity of our times is greater than any in my entire life and I've lived through a lot of insane insane times I Can't really recall anything as crazy as what's happening right now\nAnd I think of the irony of this the Feinstein gang the whole left wing Feinstein gang has for years told us if it feels good do it why not do it in the road don't be judgmental\nHave as much sex as you want anywhere you want it anytime\nBut Kavanaugh he's a rapist he is a train rapists a drunk a liar\n... a bum he's the worst person on the planet and I'll tell you something else not only that today they raise the stakes and said if he's done all these things he should be taken off the federal court what did I say to you last week\nYou'll give these rat bums a finger they're going to take your arm they will show you up like a like a wood chipper\nYou can't give them an inch I wouldn't have given them a finger nail I wouldn't have given them a finger nail but they caved in that bomb caved in on a Jeff makes like\nNew sandwich at McDonalds is going to be named in his honor the ... it's got to crush the ... the area of old branding that they buy from old bakeries\nAll right as old pork rinds they can't even sell to a third world country it's called the ... like it's a special burger for Democrats who vote for their own demise\nSo here we are someone sends me in the middle east says apparently there are a few others who are starting to talk about the CIA for connection there were dozens of sites talking about exactly what you reported last week\n[laughter] but you haven't heard it on Fox News have have you has it made it up to Fox yeah the great patriots the shoe shakers the leg shakers hey at\n... and ... that hey I haven't\nMentioned yet the one with the parts down the middle\nHey I'm a great American I'm a great American he's a great American you're a great American step right up I'm a great American he's a great America you're a great American step right up hey ab\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo I get it out of my system if you had any idea the rage I feel toward these phony as you would you have some idea because you hearing today\nThere's like an open asylum from eight today for it I'm feeling this just the tip of the iceberg\nFor what they did to this guy and I know he's not perfect we know that but he's had at least six FBI investigations how many that Obama have in all of this discussion about FBI this FBI that\nEyesight got the FBI how many FBI checks that Obama have answers zero do you know that Obama never could have passed a an FBI background check\nMeaning he could not have become an FBI agent because of associations with radical leftists like Bill Ayers did you know that\nHe's you know that to the very same people are screaming for FBI investigations had nothing to say when Obama became president does know FBI investigation of him not to unite but one but Kavanaugh was had at least six\nSix\nYou'll hear that tonight on my students show on Fox News is the producer just made a note from Philip real smart
