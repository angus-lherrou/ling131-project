China where there was a mass hysteria against the middle class poll pots Cambodia mass hysteria against anyone with eye glasses they were beaten to death or killed I Want to talk today about Columbus ohio here is a city named for Columbus Christopher Columbus\nAnd this sick a group of individuals who have forced themselves upon the city have eliminated any celebration of the namesake of their own city in your lifetime they've toned down the name of Columbus they want to go after all the founding fathers\nI Want to tell you that before we talk about Christopher Columbus per se before anyone talks about any explorer or scientists aren't as the politician\nWe need to understand the subjects motivation background and environment again as a part time best selling novelist I can tell you that one of the greatest jokes in modern socio political propaganda\nIs that the kind of basic detail every read of demands in fiction such as why is that she kept and chasing the white whale or why is Dorothy so unhappy in Kansas somehow this is not required to be present in real life\nIn the ... and tropes in monsters of the left and right in other words fiction has to be more real than reality\nAnd that's not surprising if the mainstream media had looked carefully and objectively at the back story of Iraq\nAnd Michelle Obama the Obamas never would have lived in the White House and if we give Columbus the courtesy do any historical subject it would not be possible to manipulate gullible social justice warriors into offending his statue or that a robbery or anyone else and I'm going to talk about that\nAnd I ran into you know from page fifty to a stop mass hysteria which is the most important political slash historical book of our time\nAnd I'm going to continue to show you how insane it is\nThat statues of Columbus or being torn down across America by the Maoists of our time and that Columbus ohio itself is not he was celebrating the holiday as anyone who went to school before the PC police started scrubbing the curriculum of anything that's some minority might find offensive\nThey wouldn't know the Columbus sales from Spain that nation has always been a hotbed of religious turmoil\nAnd the eleven century more than half of Spain the southern portion was on the Muslim control and known as the caliphate of Cordoba Spain's national hero Rodrigo de as the bar popularly known as el ... said the lord participated in the ...\nThe military retaking of those regions\nTaken by the Muslims the task took more than four hundred years that's why else it is known as the lord it took four hundred years\nBut was completed last in January of fourteen Ninety two and then Spain was once again a Catholic nation both holy and holy now here we get down into the Columbus thing\nFor march or fourteen Ninety two six months before Columbus reached the new world an event took place that was seemingly unrelated to the seeming but was clearly an offshoot of efforts to solidify the ... to Spain's king ... decreed that within four months old Jews had to leave Spain\nThose who I converted to Catholicism the converse so could stay\nThe eight hundred thousand Jews or would not converted we're out\nOf course an unknown number of the converse shows or attending mass but still ... really practicing Judaism these people these human beings we're known as ... wine\nAnd I've used this word ... to describe conservatives who continued to be conservative in secret in this country you understand where that came from [noise]\nLet me continue there is good evidence that Columbus who Spanish name was Cristobal cologne was Jewish probably or possibly um around all the evidence is found in the ... signed on march Nineteen fifty no sex in it he honored the Jewish customers leaving a portion of his wealth to the needy\nHe's specifically named Elizabeth Drew as the beneficiary of a portion of the state Columbus also earmarked part of his estate to go to a group

Muslim occupiers and finally he signed a document with a triangle of marks that appeared on Jewish headstones those dots and characters were intended to represent the ... the Jewish prayer for the deceased\nI'm going to continue in a few minutes reading about the real history of Christopher Columbus one of the greatest explorers in the history of the world and the sadness that we should all feel today that we'd permitted the communists and the fascist of our time to the famed this great explorer and to rip down\nHis name across America and it's all found\nIn a book that you must have even if you've never bought a book before\nStop mass hysteria [noise] this is not a polemic this has required reading for anyone who wants to save America while it still can be salvaged there's more to come on the Savage Nation\nI invite you to be around this Columbus Day to celebrate the true memory of one of the greatest explores the world has ever seen\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight by four hundred seven to eight to\n... [noise]\nThe Spanish rabbi said I tell my congregants don't think we're here for good\nAnd I encourage them to buy property in Israel this place is lost don't repeat the mistake of Algerian Jews or Venezuelan Jews Europe is lost he described the Muslim community in Europe as harboring radicals and terrorists and one is very difficult to get rid of them they only get stronger\nI'll stop right there and I'll let you read for yourself or the book mass hysteria this was one example of what I'm trying to do before it might be too late if it's not too late already and I don't think it's ever too late by the way\nSo Columbus Day is no longer a holiday for the namesake Ohio capital why is Christopher Columbus been turned into the most evil person to have ever lived was he that evil person and by the way what was life like for most of the indigenous peoples\nIn the areas that he landed on what what would they liked to each other where they kind of loving\nWhere they some kind of as sending the angels as you would have the uh as they would have you believe all of these uh lecturers of ethnic studies\nWhatever you believe that the Native American was living in peace and harmony with each other and with nature nothing could be further from the truth I have studied this issue since Nineteen Seventy the Nineteen seventies if you look at how tribes live with each other here in North America\nThink of the crypts and the bloods because that's how the tribes live with each other before the Europeans arrived\nThey will or a constant war with each other fighting over things as simple as salt\nOr hunting grounds if they captured a warrior from another tribe they would sometimes skin them alive and throw them into the snow without skin\nDo after mentioned the rapes well you see history is a very important subject and it was lost in this country a long time ago it has even last today where the common core curriculum\nIs not even being taken down by the Trump Administration I don't know if you notice but we thought that we'd be getting rid of the common core curriculum\nBut we haven't Betsy DeVos has not done that she's the education secretary who was castigated by the left and yet she's not been done much to eliminate the common core curriculum anyway you could see all of this I all of these ideas into connect with each other\nSo before I go on to some other subjects here on the Savage Nation and I have some really great soundbites I'd like to take some calls Pam I'm WABC line six go ahead please\nA package I appreciate your knowledge and I thought I had an\nEndless ... eighty forum that you've taught me how much are you\nListening to me on the radio or on the stream\nOr on the radio and my car\nWelcome January you're gonna have to listen to me on on my part cast you know that\nNo oh yeah\nYeah I'm Sorry to tell you yes uh I Can't give you the reasons that to me they're all political but nevertheless you'll still be able to

on a podcast but what's your main shall appoint\nMy main point is that how to find that line of at the holiday and I found my phone only shot\nYou know it's no longer often how long does say only how all that kind of town hall and did you say and I have found a little ignorant about why\nNo you're not ignorant that's that's an example of what the left does when they take over a society they tear down the monuments of that society and replace them with their own I'm surprised that caller Carl Marx day because that's coming next I mean if you think that this is a joke you're mistaken\nThe radical left has no infiltrated every avenue of this country and their long march to take over this country and converted into a communist dictatorship that is what you witnessed with cabin or which what ... what you saw with the tactics of the communist in the Soviet era where they condemn demand to death without a trial that's what you just saw it\nI don't really agree with you I only realized that the kinds of five and learning from yeah over all these years\nWell maybe I'm the most dangerous maybe I'm the most dangerous man in America maybe the Democrat committee miss their target by focusing on Capitol married they ought to focus on me\nI eat may maybe knowledge is the most dangerous thing to Dianne Feinstein and she ought to really make every effort she can to make sure that knowledge is not permitted in America only propaganda from the Democratic party\nWell I Hope you go out to the bookstores tomorrow in a van yourself of my great political history book stop mass

calling on why male sperm counts down in ... and the western world\nYes sir I Believe that uh there's a significant amount of damage that's being caused by pornography\nAnd I agree a thousand percent I I have read anecdotal stories of marriage is being destroyed lives being destroyed brains being destroyed ... there's no limit to what the damage that pornography is done to this country there's no end to it\nAnd that sperm count the issue I Believe was directly affected by it\nI think that uh the men are sitting as you said a for long periods of time ... out of screen\nTheir use their uh you realizing pornography to instead of having sex with their wives and uh and I believe there's a million different reasons why uh uh they're doing that but it's it's having its cause and effect so I'm not going to be a much more profound us as as we find them\nWant we know that porno websites are amongst most popular in the world there's an article on the Drudge Report right now a Web traffic race CNN beats Fox News can you believe that\nDrudge beach the New York times and the Washington Post he's an independent and guess what dominates porn sites porn sites are dominating Web traffic\nNow you could argue that's part of the free free market or you could argue that saying nation would not permit this any longer\nThat things would be done because they're destroying an entire generation forget older people\nI'm Talking about children who you know and I know are being forever warped I Am talking about couples are in couples therapy because they can no longer have normal sex because the husband has been watching the DSM and wants to wife to participate in it you don't have to call that confirm it\nThe husband watches this stuff he no longer gets aroused by normal male woman relations and he wants to most the craziest stuff you could ever imagine and then some\nTo be done in his the privacy of his own home\nAnd the woman doesn't go want to go along with it or she goes along with it and she feels no kind of activity what the man she does adjusts to please them and to have\nA little sex but it's not what she wants she wants to love and as a result of marriage starts to unravel this is all traceable to the filthy dirty sick pornographers or so called adult film stars like the one who accused Donald Trump\nOf uh of various things she suddenly an icon of America adult film star I Love the word adult film\nI don't know to me that's not an adult film where the adult film trying people up in a rubber mass that's an adult film beating somebody up that's an adult film

okay well there are cycles to everything and as I Try to explain to you last week for every action there was an equal and opposite reaction\nAnd you haven't seen the reaction yet oh no you have not if

time for the world to see how low the left will go to destroy a person who does not advanced the agenda [noise] and I think that we could see a Supreme Court making pornography illegal again how do you like that wouldn't that be amazing [noise]\nJoined those Savage Nation goal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight by four hundred seven to eight to ...\nIntelligence so called educated people to buy the propaganda in the numbers that they have been buying it\nI've not seen such mass hysteria in this country in recent times you can go back in history and find it during the McCarthy period we heard about McCarthyism and how evil he was picked on the poor\nThe poor innocent Hollywood writers how many times you've heard that story with the famous movie with zero ... throwing himself out of a window\nAnd there was actual communism back then it was real\n[laughter] well we know that from the vet known of papers that were released I Believe in the nineties\nBy Soviet intelligence after the war came down which confirmed that every one of the individuals I think without exception\nThat had been named by the house of an American activities committee ... Senate McCarthy turned out to be either the wreck fellow traveler or a an operative of the Soviet Union in Hollywood in government in the media now has that ever enter the history books\nThem in all the opposite ... those people now entered government under Obama I mean you had for example the Institute for policy studies which was a Marxist group where communist agents were literally hanging out in the lobby and then\nThey were helping rock bottom alright plans to defund the military they were helping the Obama administration and the center for American Progress\nA which helped Obama come up with all of this ... legislation so it's sort of a vicious circle but have you seen anything though on a link the mass hysteria right now\nUnder Trump why all of the sudden has mass hysteria been put on steroids under this specific administration and you write in your book you have is three men mega examples including\nA Maxine Waters basically calling for violence against Trump cabinet members calling for them for ... quote unquote pushback against them if they're seen in public I mean this is this is insane so why mass hysteria an steroids under Trump because\nThey had the country almost on the locked down before Trump one\nThey were pretty sure Hillary was a shoo in right oh yeah okay so once they got the girl in office that would have been the end of America as we know it they had the Supreme Court\nThey knew she began they knew that they were going to be a point to use it would've been over for a hundred years fifty years at least all of a sudden out of nowhere\nThere comes a a businessman a showman and here we are and they went insane they've tried everything they noticed we haven't heard much about\nThe Russia ... stories since the cabinet ... which is another mass hysteria piece of insanity but did you notice that they shifted from Russia collusion to cabin on the ... the rapists ... therefore shift there's shapes shipped to you in just\nThat they are so now they know what are they going to lose now that there's a moderate Republican U.S Supreme court set of another uh sure they call it a swing voter that's nonsense he was not a swing voter you always voted with the liberals by large\nSo what they're what they are what are they facing here why cabin or why now what they're afraid of with the fact that will have a conservative majority this is it into it until a large extent the people who opposed him the most I really dug into this in great detail\nWho won the people who accused him to most of this right well we start with Dr fraud and I studied the research that she has done that she put her name on his papers on what she has her name I was the first to do it given that I Know research\nAnd lo and behold get guess what I found she published papers on the use of the morning after drug for abortion to treat\nI Know research and lo and behold ... guess what I found she published papers on the use of the morning after drug for abortion to treat women for depression that me and she's owned\nIn my analysis by the abortion industry and the abortion drug industry this is the billions of dollars a year our and\nIf you want to just make this crudely\nFinancial the abortion racket tears and that includes all our senators will viciously slandered Kavanaugh every one of them probably receives tons of money\nDirectly or indirectly from abortion racket tears from one group to the other drug companies Planned Parenthood you name it so let's look at for the financials they stand to lose a ton of money here now it's let's not forget that she published papers\nPushing the use of the morning after pill to treat depression okay the great doctor for it I Love that doctor and you notice how\nHow many times they refer to her doctor Dr ... a doctor for a doctor for a doctor I liked that part of it because I've been called a a shock jock and every day might have a son [laughter] well you're a doctor well as I said on my radio show I have a real PHD wrote great university and you're going to have to call me Dr Savage from now on\nShock jocks average or anything else that I won't let them call me anything but docked I'll stop them and that tracks the liberals who want to play games with Dr this doctor that we're putting aside\nThe rhetoric we're living in very dangerous time they get the left has been motivated to become violent\nAnd they're being paid to be violence and I made it a comparison on my radio show the other day are and I don't know if you've heard it on the why Republicans today mhm\nThe parallels are really frightening other than the fact that we have a great economy and we did not lose World War one and have to pay reparations these social upheaval going on in America today is almost identical to that which went on in the anti war period in Germany after World War one before Hitler came to power and I warn\nThe people who listen to my show that the exact opposite of what the communist bloc thinks is going to happen by shaking up society by attacking the middle class by harassing everyone they disagree with the exact opposite it's gonna happen they're not going to gain power\nThey're going to see a complete right wing reaction in this country because Trump is not a complete right wing reaction as you well know he's actually a moderate centrist than most in most ways you know that\nIs in some ways yeah absolutely\nBut the fact is we haven't really seen the right wing revolution that they all say we're happy and I believe that if they keep this up more and more people in the independent middle are going to go and demand law and order\nJoy ... coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to\nSome of the Savage Nation is
