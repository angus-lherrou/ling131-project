which is the fact that the anchor baby population now exceeds the entire population\nOf Los Angeles California and is roughly half the population to the New York city that's because of family chain migration\nFamily chain migration and that was greatly escalated with the use of a pen and the phone by direct Hussein Obama who would not letting the Europeans and biologic didn't want any people from Europe he wanted as many people from Africa and the middle east as he could get into this country\nIt's a sad fact of reality but if you look at it from the point of view\nOf a rather how liberals are looking at Trump right now if you look at what Obama did did you say he didn't do it for any reasons other than the obvious so Trump wants to end birthright citizenship\nAnd um of course it's going to go to the Supreme Court but the good news is our Supreme Court now\nAnd I'm taking a phrase that was used by liberal comedian when Obama was president and he looked up at the sky at the White House with all the other a ... from Hollywood as there was a fly over by the U.S air force and one of the comedians looked up and said it's our air force now because these are anti military\nLeft these from Hollywood always hated the military\nSo one of them not just him and said what do you think it's our air force now so it's our Supreme Court now and Trump will easily get at least two more Ruthie as good as soon get her reward because I got the woman's what Ninety something for how old is she isn't she older than I'm Dianne Feinstein\nShe's almost old enough to be Dianne Feinstein the mother\nThat's a joke she couldn't have had her when she was seven country I Know she wants to lower the day age of consent for sex to the age of fourteen\nBut when they were getting away from the topic here side posted this\nOn my Twitter feed which you don't use it to test stories from my radio show and I can pretty much tell what's going to work\nWithout sweater I did it for years without shorter but now I test them on Twitter I Know you don't want to hear that and I put up should Trump and the anchor baby loophole was written this fourteenth amendment only to give African slaves and us write the citizenship\nSo someone writes it won't hold up in court and I wrote it's our Supreme Court now so then he is what I Want you to just listen to the kinds of stuff that comes up as fun sometimes\nIt's like playing checkers when I no longer want to play mental chess and I need to slow down I go on Twitter what I Want to remember what it was like to be a young person seven or eight years old I treat\nWhen I Want to feel that I'm back in the sixth grade I treat\nSomeone writes them Michael usually are better at hiding the authoritarian tendencies good for you owning the complete lack of respect for the constitution\nSo I wrote well your criminal dictator Obama sure liked depend on the phone you sure like to sluggish this you lost we want to get ready for the true America to reemerge the silent majority will be solace no longer\nThan someone writes your court it led by the guy who upheld Obamacare twice and I wrote we now have cabinet and two more likely\n[noise] and one really foolish individual wrote well didn't want a Democratic president gets in the second amendment is gone poorly thought out arguments I should Dumbo Supreme Court appoint these a lifetime positions\nSo you see what you want to feel like you're back in the fifth or sixth grade there's no better way to regret it and go on Twitter and then you'll meet people at your at your mental level ... sixth grade may I say eleven about all evidence well about the same level as those who still go to Hollywood movies\nNow there's another element to this anchor baby a situation which is birth tourism oh that's a big one and you know which nationality is specializing in birth tourism that's right your friends from out said some land Chinese flock to USA to give birth to us citizens\nBusiness is booming here for companies that coach pregnant women on how to Deceive Us immigration authorities so they can\nAnd it gave birth to us citizens business was booming here for companies that coach pregnant women on how to Deceive Us immigration authorities should they can enter the United states for the sole purpose of giving birth to American citizens\nAt least five hundred companies offered birth tourism services in China the Shanghai newspaper national business daily reporter\nThe cost of a trip including medical expenses runs from twenty thousand to eighty thousand dollars the business is legal in China but the tactics renting the u._s._a. or not the women are coached to lie about the purpose of their visit by lifting tourism which makes it easier to

Emma Lazarus Lazarus okay Lazarus Lazarus lesser ... ... give us your tired your poor your hungry those you're going to be free now let's pause there for a moment before we all get so agitated that we lose our lunch\nAgain I got to tell you this is so important to know back three four years ago\nI was on a yacht more in the west side of New York on the Hudson River and the Chelsea district and I gave a little party for people from my radio business and people from my publishing world about a hundred people came aboard for a cocktail party\nAnd I gave a little speech which I played on the show twice over the years 'cause I'm so proud of it\nAnd it just I think it's called an immigrant son arrived in New York against something like that and I stood on that yet and I look at the statue of liberty right down the Hudson River where ... years later would save those people on a plane you know the Hudson River name for all the Henry Hudson that evil white male\nWho ah they named the river for maybe they could renamed the Hudson River\nMaybe seal river or something like that because it may offend people down the Hudson River there's the statue of liberty and I pointed to it and I gave some remarks to the audience I Hope that they understood what I was saying that only in America [noise] could the son of an immigrant meaning may\nBe here on this boat when my grandfather came here on the urge the average steer urge third class fourth class they came in no better than most animals\nAnd they were sick for most of the voyage and they got off the boat with very little in their pockets but they had a skill or a trade that people to take care of them will usually taking care of by relatives who were waiting for them\nIn the city of their arrival there was no welfare waiting for them or they wouldn't have gotten in the country if they had no means of support you didn't get in here\nSo the rest of this story you open the little tailor shop you probably work for someone for a while\nAnd then he was so good in ... so skilled at what he was doing as I was told years later I never met him he died at thirty nine forty I don't know how old he died young you know killing himself here in this country very set I Wish I'd known him but he's the astronaut or the family Sam I call them the ... the family of one of my books\nSo this guy opens a tailor shop and to become so not well known in New York\nMainly amongst the wise guys I heard I don't know I heard the story they all had the suits made by a you know how they always like nice suits down there on the east side in those days the gangsters anyway he may suits for them or you didn't give them away charged him and he made the suits and then he died of a heart attack God Bless them\nSo what I'm saying to you is I have sympathy for those wanting to come here and make a better life for themselves I Know what it's like to want something that worked for it\nBut I also know what it's like to want something worked for it and then be destroyed in this country by social engineers member that phrase was popular about five years ago remember the social engineering that we used to talk about five years ago on the radio while we have the social engineer still at work\nAnd if you ever have ever been attacked by the left wing social engineers because you're a white male you'll know what I'm Talking about\nAnd that
