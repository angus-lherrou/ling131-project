Colorado and the faculty one he had applied for a job and the email said well we have we have to get him a media leaves whipping\nOh and the faculty one he had applied for a job and the email said well we have we have to get him a media we were going to lose weight just from my school we need someone with his background with his\nCredentials which is why eating ability to me was the whole fraud totally we thought he had about the same\nUh Indian background and the Indian tribes without ours got he's not one\nI remember that the tribes said they they said that no they don't they're not claiming him and it again it goes to this whole thing of identity politics this idea that because of your DNA or who your great great great grandmother was changes\nWho you are and how valuable you are just doesn't make sense that's not how we do it in America so it'd be like saying hey your dad was a serial murderer therefore you are a horrible person we don't do that right um but we do in front of the things\nLet's say that you were a great great great great grandfather was a slave owner that's your fault\nBut let's say your great great great great grandfather freed the slaves is that your fault or is that something that you should uh I didn't mean to a fault of the opposite right and it says something you should get credit for you\nKnow you get credit for all you do in the United states of America it's supposed to be a merit based society supposed to be content of character and what you do and what you create and what your actions are\nAnd yet we're turning it into this idea we're going backwards what used to be a very liberal idea I'm going to treat everyone the same\nI'm not gonna care what color you are I'm not gonna care whether you're a man or a woman I'm not going to care what religion you believe in I'm not going to care where you came from I'm going to treat everyone I come in contact with the same they used to be very liberal idea\nNow\nIt's a very conservative idea of the liberals say is a way to oppress people are used to be a very liberal idea to say that the way to not discriminate on the color is to treat everyone the same now they're saying if you treat everyone the same that's discriminatory\nThat's how crazy this world is gone its upside down inside out its bizarro world and I was also telling you about that no one is not the only problem story for the Democrats on Capitol we go to this\nThis is from ABC News\nAnd or ... no I'm Sorry yeah it is yeah sorry Washington Post ABC poll generic ballot in battleground districts the ones that really count the battleground districts where it's kind of you know we don't know who's going to win look we all know in the house everybody in the house is up for election every two years right\nAnd we all know there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Republican and there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Democrat I mean it doesn't matter you know the ours is going to win in this district the ... going to win in this district and it's done doesn't really matter who the names are\nAnd then we get to the ones that are battleground districts where it's gone up for grabs we're not sure who's gonna win this one and that's where the movement happens in the house of representatives so this Washington Post ABC News poll looked at those battleground districts\nAnd on the generic ballot right you vote for Republican or Democrat the Republicans are up one\nNo way it's red and white and blue maintenance on one kind of my wife is a

term enthusiasm a wind up wasted in places they don't need the extra votes\nVery strong democratic areas right nationwide Trump has a forty one percent approval rating Democrats have a fifty three to forty two percent edge in the generic ballot for the house but you go to the districts that are toss ups the sixty six districts\nThe lead evaporates and it becomes plus one for Republicans\nWhile\nBy the way that means that the Democrats need eight twenty three feet flip to in the house they have to win forty five out of sixty six battleground districts to in the house that doesn't look good
