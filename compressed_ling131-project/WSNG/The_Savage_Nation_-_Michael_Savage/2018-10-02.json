...\nWomen today on the ... ... a little over every woman is or a very well now\nBelieve in equality and ah I Believe that women dressed like men are capable of great things and evil things and that should be an obvious thing to anyone but apparently the way the narratives being played out but the Democrats are all women up to be believed and their innocence and pure and all men are evil so you have to destroy the patriarchy\nWhile again let's go back in history in ancient Rome did you know that they're women gladiators or justice bloodthirsty as male gladiators as you know that you didn't know that\nYou know any of that there were female gladiators what justice bloodthirsty as a male gladiator they love blood they love the blood sport and so that we see the gladiators in modern times sitting on a committee\nLike an ancient Rome destroying a man cutting them two ribbons in front of the public in the public sits like dummies and doesn't see the blood thirsty ness of these women\nAre they more like Venus the goddess of love and beauty or like a Vulcan the God of fire\nNow who was Venus Venus you know that the first five planets in our solar system are named after Roman gods because Romans could see them without telescope did you do that first by pilots named after Roman gods to show the influence of ancient Rome\nSo Venus was the goddess of love and beauty she was the daughter of Jupiter and the on an ocean side them and Venus was desired as a wife by many of the guards\nAnd she was promised by Jupiter to her brother Vulcan and guess what happened unsatisfied with her marriage to the ugly guard\nVenus took many lovers including our own half brother Mars the God of war with whom she got several children well okay that's nothing to do with what we're going through today but it's sometimes I have to look at history or science so poetry or art\nOr music to get away from the insanity of our times and that's why I'm bringing you a little history today to lighten the load of carrying the horror\nThat as being inflicted upon the American people by the Feinstein gladiators core out to destroy who I think it's an ordinarily decent man now remember\nKavanaugh has gone through three background checks he was a virtual unknown federal judge\nNobody ever said anything about him in all these years how come all of these poor innocent women came forth all of a sudden because they're set ups every last one of them and all you have to do is look at the last one who was unfortunately shows you how low the peacock as fall in\nThat NBC would take this coming lawyer who brings forth all lie or of the highest order\nAnd she comes up there and then they say well we can't verify anything she sang about cabinet or the latest one but we're going to give her air time anyway so they turn to homophobia to attack Lindsey Graham\nThey turn against a they turn to a scum lawyer who represents a stripper\nAnd they bring up this Julie sweet neck was sweet Neko sweat neck and yet her ex boyfriend them Julie sweat neck says that Julie sweat next threatened to kill his unborn child and she exaggerated everything Julie sweet next or sweat next\nSays that Julie sweating that threatened to kill his unborn child and she exaggerated everything Julie sweet next door sweating ex boyfriend who has a name Richard but that she said that this accuser of cabinet as far as fundamentally crazy [noise]\nThat he or she threatened to kill as unborn child and exaggerated everything\nSo she goes on NBC was this thing which network and she backed tracks on some of our claims during the interview and NBC dozens apologized\nSo this is what's going on in America today you have a choice the Democrats or in this case hold your nose the Republicans joy those Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred Savage eight five four hundred seven to eight\nBut the fact of the matter is most lawyers as you well know are not at all in it for the truth there into crucified people just take a look at the one who's representing all of these fake accusers one of the lowest scum to have ever received a law degree and the areas on every television channel over and over and over again\nWhile distinguished scholars and broadcasters myself included are completely blocked from the Soviet networks why is this happening why because as I just said to you there is a plan this is not happening by accident\nAs included in the ... the beginning of chapter five\nThe essential question a nation that's been forced to ask over and over is who is pulling the strings and why why are why is this happening well let's look at a real war against women and you have to look at the real war against women that as being conducted by those who claim to be protecting women\nSo we go back to the Salem witch trials and the hysteria against which isn't the Salem region was fermented environment of economic associate political turmoil does that sound familiar well it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more [noise]\nSo what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened well the minister of Salem Village was the strict pious Reverend Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven at night in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fish as they were called at the time\nOf the girls through objects scream made strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions\nAs with John good wins children in Connecticut\nA doctor was cold and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounce the element to be demonic in nature\nWell then another local girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of there'll be which on February twenty ninth under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty\nSarah Good a pregnant beg a woman\nAnd the Paracels Caribbean slave to the tuba\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did that one in their town\nGood and ... one profess their innocence to no avail and so did too but at first those slaves were rare and the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for home she was largely responsible\nBut Paris whipped er into confessing promising to secure her release if she did so the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and bid me serving\nAn added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans she also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom rye and urine with which she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help her of a local which what happened next [noise] the three women wore a prison the next day despite his promise Paris bound to political expediency\nAnd allow the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and Terminator\nAs soon as the women were in prison the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the auto distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants than farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for a new cyclists sixteen Ninety two\nAnd that was which is right in their midst to too but had said there were others the word spread that they had to be found using the tactics of Dianne Feinstein and the committee tactics\nThat said there were others the word spread that they had to be found using the tactics of Dianne Feinstein and the committee tactics or mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purged itself of tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on her own had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books in publications\nAnd so the hysteria gathered force throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continue to grow by the end of may more than sixty people were jailed awaiting trial for witchcraft\nThat was when the governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and Terminator and what happened then\nOn June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hang its first victim Bridget Bishop a brass the widows late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular other than that she was a soft target the woman was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing\nWhich was considered to signify sexual yearning and prowess\nWell it went on and on and on\nAnd what happened well caught and mayor put his agenda ahead of justice he crafted the equivalent to fake there was a good tribute to his own call to arms of the court right in the following we cannot but humbly recommend onto the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution\nOf such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in the laws of God and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of witchcraft\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria view citizens regardless of their standing or immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials and so that we speed forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern\nIf for example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been hysteria and twenty eight team this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history\nWhich is already get from the media today you would learn that the following that for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media would have you believe it is fact it is history\nAnd I urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well\nAnd what do I mean by that none in the media will dare call it by its proper name not in the media will reference nine eleven is proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they have been at war with the west for fourteen hundred years\nAnd that is why I tell you history is a great great teacher\nWere going through a form of mass and easier which is not a myth mass and easier is not a myth is a conspiracy of sorts a vaguely defined plan to undermine the nation mass amnesia its perpetrators know that malleable populace is a necessary tool to achieve an agenda\nAs bird they sat Bernie Sanders discovered with this pie in the sky promises during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nIf you cannot seduce them with promises of free things and mass hysteria about the other guys you have to take another tack you have to do there which tell them that that means is okay it's harmless it's fine and what I'm Talking about today is marijuana\nRemember for many many years marijuana was seen as the evil drugs the most evil drug of all and we were subjected to a form of mass\nBrainwashing about the dangers of marijuana\nBut today the exact opposite is being promulgated which is that marijuana is the miracle cure for everything from Boulder salads houses cancer falling arches arthritis ... runny noses run a year's runny eyes depression it's insanity a form of mass hysteria\nThat is used to drug use in order to manipulate them into following the orders of the left\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nEnjoy the Savage Nation coal no eight five
