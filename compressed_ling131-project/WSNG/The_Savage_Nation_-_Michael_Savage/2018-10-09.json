won't get it\nYou'll get the official story over and over again saluting her how great she is my opinion is a little different than that of the establishment\nI Believe Haley resigned because she a

was heard and I think she failed her controllers whoever they may be an average suspicion who she really your reports to what it is and the president the United states so my opinion is\nHaley's resignation as first of all a good thing unless they pick somebody even more reluctant than her she was a militant hawk in a terrible situation for America we didn't need a militant hawking the UN\nWe needed a skilled diplomat in the year when she was not a skill diplomat\nAnd as I said she couldn't ignite a war with Russia by bombing Syria and so her controllers polar off the stage it's been done

left and right there's no room in America for the independent minded individual let me tell you that right now almost no room whatsoever none whatsoever\nYou got to play the game according to the rules and the rules say you're joined one party or the other it's an interesting that so many people who put Trump down for a year straight back to other candidates ridicule you are now making believe that that the greatest supporter of Donald Trump well he's not fooled by it\nAnd I'm not fooled by it so you know I'm not going to read and read from the book I'm not in the mood to read from the book I don't even want to read from the book you can read it yourself and maybe we'll talk about it tomorrow\nOr it's the most important political book of our time I'll leave it at that but I Want to do is take some of your calls and I would like to reference an article written by Cindy grows in the times of Israel I'm going to read you a few paragraphs\nAnd I'll Try to stay away from the obvious she says\nSavage is the host of one of the most countries most streamlined radio shows but Michael Savage is also a fortune teller a brilliant wanted that who else of Michael Savage would release a book on October ninth the first day of work for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation is nothing new but it's at its worst and then she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it\nFrom Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then the she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by sentence the politicians with ulterior motives\n[noise] Savage provides vital context for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects and the tactics of the puppet masters who do gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine\nShe then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times of Israel and she's very Jewish\nAnd she asked me a key question which was funny which was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Kavanaugh at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they are great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out and in quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models his platform from the power man this or the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young\n... of course we discussed the Kavanaugh hysteria\nAnd he said the check off the smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male white heterosexual married and Christian the involvement of a Feinstein who was not Jewish Blumenthal Blumenthal Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared to how Jews were treated during the alpha Dreyfuss are Leo Frank cases\nSavage also related how Jewish laws and ethics are the exact opposite of what took place during the process of confirming avid or I thought that was the most salient points of our interview Savage related how the Jewish laws an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place\nDuring the process of governing Kavanaugh and what was sad about it was that there were Jewish people\nViolating the ethics of their fathers Blumenthal amongst them Blumenthal and others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day that Hillary has it in the White House to any critics Savage says nobody agrees with a spouse or a friend one hundred percent\nAnd then he went on with other stuff Savage encourages opposition to read the book and debate him\nAnd of course my discussion with Savage including where to get some good food the Catskill Mountains and as involvement with about\nSo there was a very good interview and I ... and it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come but let's get back to the news of the day and my opinion on it I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resign suddenly\nBecause she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning she was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ambassador is supposed to be an ambassador is supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was too\nCaused dissention with Russia through Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack\nWhich I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag there were about to a release gas and say that Assad did it I pointed out over and over again Assad would be an insane individualized would put them to do this when they're\nWhen they've got ISIS backed in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow people within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drums for the launch of Tomahawk against Syria\nWell it was miss the most jazz trio himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that in the ... plant\nOr in the national security advisor ship position and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war and the worst way they would bloodthirsty and they wanted war but for some reason the non global is around from\nWar of the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me\nAnd then we're talking about
