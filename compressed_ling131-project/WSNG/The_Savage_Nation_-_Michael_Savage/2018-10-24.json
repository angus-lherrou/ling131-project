Nation we're talking about my skepticism about the quote suspicious bomb packages for a number of reasons I mean even if you're a liberal and a reasonable liberal and you know when your heart of hearts you don't believe a word that the right wing would they were stupid thing like this for two reasons number one\nWhat's the point number two or none of the bombs went off thank God and you know you want to get into this and I really\nHad a dramatic way\nYou've got a lot of people on the right or ex military experts in the detonation explosive devices I don't believe that the bombs wouldn't have gone off if the right it sent them and I I'm Glad they didn't all things seems like a Halloween prank\nAnd you know here's the greatest proof to me where have you seen today on CNN or MSN any of them\nA picture of the uh uh ten thousand or twenty thousand young strapping soldiers coming in from Honduras\nThese warriors they're all war is you've got to understand something people from Mexico and those countries are are phenomenally great fighters by the way to separate story everyone knows for example even though they're not Mexicans that the Mexican boxers or about the best in the world because they have a rule that come from such poverty\nThat they have one rule which is always keep going forward they never back up the only way to stop and Mexican fighters to knock 'em out everybody knows that in the ... in the fighting world\nSo you got the same type of desperate people coming out of Guatemala El Salvador Honduras strapping strong young men and every day we're seeing at the march gets bigger the Democrats added backfire blow up in their face you're talking about a bomb that bomb blew up at a Democrat face the bottom of the marchers\nNobody wants them here so what did they do I think this is the stunt that so\nThat's a genie on WABC New York thanks for listening line seven go ahead please\nHigh ... high def without speaking with you know I I Want a Columbia University but I Do have a cat and there's no way anyone could have a God and on and put it up on our place the pipe bomb without anyone noticing how her everywhere\n[laughter] yeah you're right you're telling me that Clinton's how it would have no cameras they had to go to the neighbor for a camera what they don't have a camera system\nThey have the cameras from there or have service so why not internalized\nOn on the genie it says that way you're calling me from the heart of the monster New York city and it says you're a liberal at Columbia is that true\nI I I have to tell you I voted for Barack Obama twice I I Know a lot but\nI think if I may not diehard Democrats I mean I've worked with the nutrition therapy through the ... program for several years I run Colombia and a lot of people are afraid of this migrant ... and you know a lot of\nAh well look I'm a former social worker in New York in my district was the Upper West side I'm quite familiar with social work but it doesn't take a liberal or conservative to have common sense\nAnd I'm Glad you said you need that to you even though your politics or the opposite of so many of my listeners you're also skeptical of this set up\nAnd you know with my position is let's just not lose our minds in order to get what we want here can't we use reason I think the whole thing stinks to high evidence too convenient it all happened at the same time so I give you a prize for thinking I Would say if you suspect you don't express yourself into lumber you this way do you\nKnow because I'm very careful not to run down you know I talked\nTo you know that I after I have to repeat this for you I ran into a woman from Hungary two weeks ago in the street\nWe got to ... she said to me that people are more afraid in America today to express themselves politically than they were on the Soviet ... and the Soviet times I said I Know that here in San Francisco people are all terrified there's a small band of fanatical left us to own a newspaper\nOwned the media and seemed to control everyone's thinking\nAnd it doesn't matter what the racist people are afraid to express themselves anywhere in the city so I think you're a very brave lady can I please send you a copy and it will be in a plane brown rapper\nBecause I don't want to get you in trouble it'll come to you the way pornography use three mail in the Nineteen fifties I'm just send you a copy of stop mass hysteria only if you say you want it it'll be in a plane brown rapper as I said\nI don't think that this happened in the answer is a rehab and I think what we've done here are going to be on you know they they you know they want to\nAlthough we have and I think what the Democratic Party is going to be on it you know they they you know they live on campus a lot of wealthy positions I actually come Columbia medical for their care it's well known document that I don't want to be with anybody you know they don't want to\nDo you mean the the rich the ... the the wealthy liberals who who make believe that down with the people\nYes but not\nAs an old story All right very good I got one live on out there\nOr that opens up one line and a five five no that's a very good call I'm Glad she's listening to me on a station right now through the end of December biggest come January\nYou're not going to be able to hear me on WABC and other stations some you will have new stations but for reasons I cannot describe I Will not be on a New York city you'll have to get my project which is absolutely free you'll get the annex brigade in Michael Savage saying things that you don't even hear on the radio which will be actually more fun for me\nWhile I'm Alive today in San Francisco\nAnd I'm skeptical of these devices\nJoy ... coal know eat bugs ... four hundred seven eight bucks for four hundred seven to eight to ... [noise]\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately I have been trying to tell America for a long time now\nThat there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace they only know hatred and war\nBut okay if you don't want to talk about that that's fine I Want to go to a postal employee us something to add to the discussion right now Mike in K. E. Y. S. territory in Texas on line seven Mike you're a postal employee\nYes Dr Savage I just wanted to add\nThat the fact that just to not go through the also service they can say all landed on the exact same day and there is Darren safeguards on every step of the way to isolate men that are suspicious and they all these packages is Dr Savage\nHave a foot peculiar criteria and we are trained and every step on that\nTo isolate the and identify them there's no way these packages all got delivered the same day or through the the survey\nAre so so what they're saying what they were all hand delivered\nI I don't know Dr than a guy I I I've been breaking I'm\n... I'm reading the News I'm reading the news it says all of them were hand delivered right white so if they're all hand delivered to Hillary to delivery to ... to Soros there are no surveillance pictures of the the personal hand delivered it in the mailbox\nAnd they're not going to show it to get back to that but it wasn't a false employ because the way\nAre and what you're doing is clear why you're holding your clearing the your postal employee or you're confirming this absolutely couldn't have gone through none of these went through the mail that's important to know right that that in\nCase that All right so we all agree didn't go through the postal service so these quote bombs\nWere hand delivered to hope Obama Clinton CNN holder Boston when shows they all got one none of them have surveillance pictures of the personal delivered them even a shadowy figure in a in a raincoat now I don't believe the host the host certainly doesn't make sense to me\nOr I look I'm from another ...
