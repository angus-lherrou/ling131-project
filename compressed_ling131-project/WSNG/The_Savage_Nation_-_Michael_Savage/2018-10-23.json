being blamed by the entire conservative movement for destroying our country and destroying our borders we we've all we've\nAll known that and yet he gives a speech today\nWhere he says Trump will disappear and twenty twenty or even sooner now why would a man who was just allegedly allegedly frightened by a bomb that went off somewhere on his property if that's true why would he suddenly come

goes Savage Nation so no five five four hundred Seventy five or four or five or seven weeks of\n\nThe border\nAt least twenty miles from the border I don't think anybody in their right mind would try to cross this five wire and then on the other and then\nAs you lay it down closer to the point that we have our military there you know with these people within the illegals caravan of of of of immigrants\nWell the answer to that is what would the vermin and the media do what would the fake news men do with the New York times the Washington Post there were screaming we're not fake news tell me what all the anti Americans were in high places this tiny percentage there's maybe one percent of the American population if that in the media who hate\nThis country and especially its sovereignty tell me what that less than one percent of anti American farmers will Silverman will say tell me\nI'm trying not to get excited but we're being controlled by a very small tiny minority of people in this country who have way too much power over the survival of the nation\nIs all about optics it's all about optics you're telling me that these mobs wouldn't make a young woman and baby and a baby carriage be the first into that barbed wire\nFor you know I use mobs would push the ... that the women and children into the barbed wire and make sure that the the CNN people there make sure that they are ... years of the world are costs the American conscience with their fake news I think I'm gonna start using the words fake news more now because they don't like it\nThey're always complaining that it might cause violence they've already cause violence now they're screaming let's stop it before someone gets hurt or dummies isn't plenty of people's\nHard on our side so you want to tamp down the rhetoric you want to stop hating Trump for a little while why don't you try that Mr sucker of CNN\nMr Zarqa should stop the hatred for a while but let's go back to your uh your point is that the only solution is a barbed wire barrier\nFor that's what I thought that was my theory but in the same token I can understand where you're coming from their CNN it's going to get in and grab this ain't gonna run with it because all the people innocent people\nOr how about the witches on MSNBC what are the which is an image from is he going to do with it the anti American anti family anti gun anti Christian women on MSNBC what are they going to do with it or that felt good boy it felt good saying that I'm ... years what are all the which is on MSNBC the anti American\nAnti family anti God which is on MSN NBC men and women what are they going to do with this with with such a fence I don't know I'm going to send you a copy of stop mass hysteria maybe you can convert one person to reality in New York if you're calling from New York I don't even know\n[noise] well I'm open for business here I promise and other stuff we're only talking about the ... one if you won the Powerball mega millions sixty one point six billion dollars how much would you actually pay\nWell mostly if you don't know that we'll make more than a certain amount of pay thirty seven percent of our income to the feds\nAnd then if we live in New York\nOr California we pay him a lot more New York has the highest state tax in the country and then California is running a close second about twelve to fourteen Fifteen Percent mistake on top of federal tax which used to be the duck to both from federal income tax\nBut when Trump's tax plan in place we can no longer the duct our state income tax payments from a federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes California did you do that\nWe can no longer the duct our state income tax payments from federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes in California did you know that no no this is this is a terrible reality so that's the top income tax rate for individuals there's thirty seven percent\nAnd that rate applies to adjusted gross income uh five hundred thousand or more so if you hit the jackpot you'll pay at least thirty seven percent and then state taxes depending upon the state you live in [noise] after all the gangs have to take their cut to you know the gangs that are run the states need to take their cut\nHow else can they buy their new brownies suits and they're five hundred dollar ties how can you buy a brand new suit unless you're taking the money from the the ...\nSo how are we going to stop this this I'm Matt ... these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you but you want a little tiny history about\nWhen Rome was broken into by the vandals in the ... when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find that offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men barbarians how do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them\nWhy do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right to snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that that would be a logical\nSo let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people\nOf the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you're in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have the deranged walking the streets\nBut I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow does happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which were called their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know where I go to the whole story now you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr or something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire in the in the east and west well as I describe in stock mass hysteria and as a described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening very important for you to hear the ... the empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating morally and then they face the barbarians on their borders\nAnd again it's just what happened next\nWell all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and Daniel enemies without pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the rhyme\nIn North Hungary where the vandals and what was once that Syria and is now Romania\nLive is a Godzilla west Scott's behind those in South Russia where the east guts or asteroid gods and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then there with the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nAnd I will tell you assume what happened and how the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west\nDuring those Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss
