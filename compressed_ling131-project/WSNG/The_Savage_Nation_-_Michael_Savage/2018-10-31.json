this country\nWhere there's the stop\nAnd what does this do not those like Don Lemon who are secure in their positions are in large salaries are protected by bodyguards protected by the corporation what does it do\nTo the poor white male and the bottom who was isolated and has no voice no podium onto the teeth at the breaking point\nThe poor white male and the bottom ... who was isolated it has no voice no podium onto the teeth at the breaking point wants to lash out in the here's a thing like this that somebody wants to have him deported from his own country wants his citizenship stolen from him\nDevices I have both lifelong uses proprietary technology to help detect a range of threats your identity how about your personal info for sale on the dark Web well known and security protects against online threats like rent somewhere on malware and\nIf there's a problem life walk with Norton as agents will work to fix that no one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime and

traditional ten percent off your first year plus you get a twenty five dollar Amazon gift gone with annual enrollment that's life locked dot com ... coach Savage for ten percent off and they twenty five dollar Amazon gift card life locked dot com coach Savage terms apply\nAll\nRight we're back on the Savage Nation and here we are I guess I should go back to my little self ... so\nI Can't keep talking about this any more it's it's sickening we know what needs to be done in order to tamp it all down stop the hatred we know that the media actually is inciting lead to violence nature of the country we know that it's a clear fact\nWe also know they're out of control we all also know that they need to be censored as they once were there was a time the media was censored in this country Hollywood was censored before\nOne censorship entered and the the fields from Brooklyn entered into a Hollywood the lowest form of humanity the drug addicts went to Hollywood they brought the worst mentality\nThat the movies that ever seen the most violent the most perverse there are no controls whatsoever on Hollywood and since there's now a an overlap between the news and the Hollywood you're getting the same mentality running the news media that's really what's happening\nThe interlocking corporate direct strips which I've talked about for a long time\nSo I Can't control at all I can do with control my own thoughts you understand that that's all I can do you think I don't rage warfare you'd think I don't go crazy sometimes as say things I Would never say on the air you'd be mistaken I Do I'll admit it but you're never going to hear when I say you're never going to get what I say because I'm a human being just like you are\nBut I Know to limit you don't bring it to the public airwaves like CNN let's this jerk do and it's a man has no self control ... control themselves they have to control it it's that simple show you know I'm going to do in January a podcast and radio show which I Am a head of the curve\nSome big trend now that I started it's going to be a\nA a hybrid one hour of radio in some markets two hours of radio in some markets know hours of radio because they don't want me on the air but you can still catch me on my pod cast which is free and\nThere's going to be many way you go to your favorite podcast site for example whatever you're doing now\nAnd sign onto the Michael Savage broadcast and that's how you get it or you go to Michael Savage dot com you get it on your iPhone that simple so let's say this was my second hour and I'm doing a podcast you don't know that I just cooked lunch and I had breakfast lunch at the same time of that fight that long break\nI went to the radio kitchen I was starving again\nI didn't want to eat that garbage Chinese food one more time I can't take it anymore it's killing my health like I got a child it's turning black from it the food is so bad it's killing my circulation one small total is turning them a slightly black\nEspecially the ... I got to go back to my ... diet in mind I was one show very austere in my eating habits\nI weighed a hundred and thirty pounds I ran up hills that was a long time ago but I mean I Know enough not to eat that poisoned every day from these Chinese restaurants anyone would do that the salt in the garbage they put her let alone low quality as she puts a I looked in the refrigerator you heard the radio station you know what I made for lunch I'm going to tell you what I Would do in a park yes I took\nTook two little strips of uh smoked salmon put them in the frying pan fry them slightly through two eggs on top of the NATO to crackers and why are you telling me this when there's so many important things in the world\nBecause I feel like it until I'm told that I cannot talk about what I eat for lunch I Will not stop talking about what I ate for lunch so I think his favorite segment is going to be in park yes from time to try like lunch with them having for lunch that day\nI'm a food guide dogs you know me as the food guy when the missus wants to get the dogs attention she says she comes to food guy\nI'm known as the food they lowered the little dogs when they see me come and they know\nAnd that way I'm like my mother I like to see everyone happy and eat a lot I killed one dog like this year's ago pushed away over fed her she was forty pounds overweight when I got zero weather they had to take her away from you know we gave her way to someone she put and put her on a diet she was near death but she lived an extra two years\nWhen I got zero weather they had to take her away from you know we gave her way to someone she put a put her on a died she was near death but she lived an extra two years up on a ranch because they fed or a dog diet not my diet that Chinese Fifteen\nTall right she's mixed he's got a mixed dog and human diet I Can't help myself he looks at me I Can't help but I give them a little bit of steak little this with the with the dog food but the coughing now probably blew out his arteries from but who knows [noise]\nI'll be back to talk about news views are reviews you don't want to hear right here on the Savage Nation ... ... feet by five four hundred seven eight five or four hundred seven to eight to [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] for many years I've been wanting to Savage Nation about a secret war on cash by big government and big tech to steal both your money and your privacy well recent reports confirm that this war is expanding like wildfire\nThe you know what all that sucrose does to your child's brain how could you be so ignorant of the relationship between all of that poison and then they behave the next day\nMany of the mothers are stupid and the children I watch them I I watch in the suburbs of fathers and mothers they look intelligent they look clean cut but most of them are stupid there's damage the children first of all they walk around the streets with alcohol in their hands in the suburbs it's a big thing I don't know if it then you I Can't believe that\nThe kids are running around getting high on sugar and the parents are running around high on tequila in the same street\nSo that's the world we live and it's like Brazil [noise] it's like a holiday and Brazil like something to do with car they ate celebrity costumes that sparked outrage confusion\nWhat if I tell you I hate celebrities I think that they're all mentally ill and they should be in a mental hospital first of all most of them are in mental hospitals in and out number one can you imagine being a celebrity fulltime that you have to be in the news every minute on\nOn on Instagram can you imagine living that you have to take a picture of yourself here I Am in the toilet you're in the shower here I Am taking a picture myself here I Am on a yacht enjoying myself\nHave you ever seen what these dumb women\nDo and the dumb and have you looked at how stupid they are have you seen how idiotic they are every minute under bull under this under boob under this anything to get in the media and still but\nThe point is the children to watch this and they ate the behavior in the children become dumb like the celebrities does it stop them from doing it know\nAm I entitled to talk about it yes will change anything will I make one more onyx starlet for one second pause taking a picture of herself as watching a show less than on TV I stopped watching Netflix it's an addiction I got addicted to Netflix all admitted it started with the thing on the Mexican drug lord a\nEl Chapo little did I Know the next thing we a Turkish police drama then I got hooked on a French police drama\nI Can't stop it they they ... I'm watching I mean I don't even leave the house that's why I'm starting to look like Charles Manson my hair is growing there's nowhere to go I finish a radio show eat dinner and watch TV and because there are no ads I prefer a Netflix that's sort of aunts and ruin it\nI don't even watch cable anymore I see there are killing them I used to watch a movie on HBO no more\nAll they got his that said you know government media complex adjuster I don't watch them or Showtime nothing is never a good movie on All right so watch Netflix or one that I liked the foreign dramas and\nLast night I I that was the end of it I I couldn't take it anymore\nI ... I was so desperate I was watching a thing called ... where one of the actors from the Sopranos did it a number of years ago someone mentioned that I didn't want to watch them I never liked the guy\nHe plays guitar for Bruce springs springs thing or Bruce Springfield whatever the guy's name as the anti Trump or as I Know they're left wing liars they'll like Robert De Niro rat pack you know what I'm saying that kind of how could these guys be so stupid as Donald Trump's so much\nSo this guy to guy looked like with the hair they'll the guitarists I never book does act there are characters their Sopranos I liked he was not one of them I never was convinced that he was convincing All right so it turns out that he conned someone and to making a series years ago ...\nAbout a mob guy was on the lam and he chooses to go to Norway Finland I don't know no way no it it's kind of funny in in concept and it's hit and miss it's not that good but just stick with it because some of it is good and I like the the snow and the trains and the scenery\nAnd I just want to see some difference I'm watching what finally last that I had enough I said this is garbage this is such trash why do they even make it so I got man and went back to regular television and I watched um\nI said this is garbage this is such trash why do they even make it so I got man and went back to regular television and I watched um [noise] what was I saying before before the eggs are going to my head now\nI watch the um below decks which is about life on the young people will see that on bravo right when you ever watched that below decks once in a while now well you've heard about it's about the crew you know and the captain\nAnd you're supposed to have a vicarious thrill like you're on a yacht\nHaving been on yachts I can tell you that it's hogwash it's all acted the whole thing is scripted\nBut you get a peek at some of the most beautiful boats on earth and that's nice and at the end of the day you realize what a boring life it is so last night's episode was some guy from Silicon Valley with is ugly girlfriend and\nA group of people and they rent a boat or about two hundred and fifty thousand bucks a week that's what they cost would you leave it to fifty three hundred thousand plus costs plus a tip no less [laughter] that's the kind of money\nAll right so they come aboard and the next thing you know every second the guy as a a camera in his face they're all taking pictures themselves they're obsessed with social media they're sitting in a chair the cameras rolling they're having a drink the cameras rolling\nThere in the hot tub with a camera how do people live like this and why would anyone care to watch that I asked myself but anyway I watched it for about Fifteen minutes with with interest because I'm an employer I Need a vacation between ... writing the book [noise]\nStop mass hysteria\nBetween nervously awaiting for it to come out amongst too late if that book it come out in August that would've been a number one bestseller on the New York times was everyone knows that but unfortunately that's how it came out it came out with the heaviest competition that any publisher has ever seen I have three different publishers said to me\nThe day that stop mass hysteria came out it was heading into the heaviest wins they've ever seen the history of publishing that it made it to number Lebanon a list as a miracle unto itself in the loyalty the audiences are overwhelming but nevertheless ah after the book and the book launching the promotion\nAnd now the election I haven't had a minute's rest I haven't had a vacation and\n... and when I'm starting a new career in January would you leave that I'm always starting something new I never asked I'm like true Rolling Stone\nI really I don't get any more so I'll tell you that so I Am starting a brand new career at this point in my life which is amazing most people would have retired so you don't want to hell with it I don't want to know more\nSo enough already they don't want me on this station they want me on that station and there still are some new what do I need it for but I'm going to give the pod casting a shot because that's absolutely the future of broadcasting everybody knows that\nPodcast thing is going to be to the spoken word what cable became chew the visual image I remember there was first broadcast television and every two minutes there was an ad\nAnd then people came up with cable and then you also watching cable because there were no ads in the beginning remember that one part casting is sort of like that with the ads are interspersed than much fewer and much freer form and there's going to be a hybrid because I don't want to leave broadcast radio I Love broadcast radio like you're listening to me now\nOn almost three hundred stations across America most of them have program directors who are smart enough to carry the show in the one or two hour form it's not true everywhere some of them\nHave such a political hatred for me that you will not be able to hear me in their market I Know I'm not supposed to say it\nBut there I just it it's all politics make no mistake about it but hey in the market that we're in today the show can be hurt anyway so it will be heard as a podcast and broadcast you'll be able to get it\nSo I got to train you how to get it as a podcast it's simple let's say come January and you don't hear me anymore and your station you just go to Michael Savage dot com and as a box you click on it\nIt will take you to one of eight or nine different podcasting platforms\nOr if you're already listening to someone and podcasting you go to them and you look for the Michael Savage broadcast it's that simple you can listen to it in the car or on vacation below deck subduction between ...\nAnd that's it\nSo that said podcasting is sort of like the cable television when it first came out it's definitely the growth industry or the\nSpoken word and truthfully I don't want to spend the rest of my life just looking for entertainment or or am I going to do with my rest of my life not work I Love radio to me being on radio it's like being on a ... a water water ski ... this is like water skiing for me\nIt's thoroughly beautiful to be on the radio I got to be right back or I'm going to lose it altogether\nJoined the Savage Nation coal
