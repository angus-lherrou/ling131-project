... no reaction\nIt's just a funny stunt you know I've been watching a lot of movies from on Netflix and most of them I picked to watch are not made in America and wondering I've become a couple I've been fascinated with er an Arabic one was a Turkish drama I became hooked on\nIn Turkish and now I'm watching one I'll high but I think and it's set in Lebanon and the border of Lebanon and Syria with the mafia family that's been there for hundreds of years that control an entire district and the you know they run the drugs that run the guns through the district and what I came to understand something\nUh watching these Arabic dramas first of all I Love the language I Love to watch it I like to see the subtitles\nThe none of these films have any sexuality in them and yet they're captivating none of the films TV shows made in Muslim countries show any sex and yet the captivating the women are stunningly beautiful the men are very ...\nAnd and testosterone driven filled with rage the way most real men are\nAnd yet there is no sex shown there's just a subtle sexuality and all of it through the appearance of the people but again no overt sexuality such as a side note of watching this drama of this a\nLebanese mafia family in the hills of Lebanon on the border with Syria that I got was almost all of the American mafia movies the ... the over the overly costly nature of the way the gangster speaking American Gangster movies are used to up until recently\nA is all directly related to the structure of these Arabic families incidentally in other words when you see the Sicilian mafia type speaking in a court manner\nWhich we came to think is highly theatrical\nAnd that is derived from the structure of the language and of the families or that was laid down by the Arabic invaders of Sicily it's a long time ago and I'm trying to explain something to you\nThat even watching TV drama you could put the pieces together and see the connections that doesn't have anything to do with the cabin or hearing I'm just giving good observation they only observation as any relevance to this time today in what I'm discussing and in watching this drama in Arabic\nIs again there is no section it there's no filth in it there's no dirty language that there's no apps nothing no rubbing of the body parts no ... no jewels in the teeth none none of that none of the filth in garbage of the American media today is in it and yet as captivating to watch\nNow we switched over to America last night hits a new low in the new ... America\nAnd a man on television who I think is basically talent lists and psychotic I Would say that Jimmy Kimmel by my estimation as a mentally ill person seriously mentally ill\nFor him to take out a tray with mushrooms on it and ask a degenerate filthy poll dancing over the hill horse faced loser which one most approximate the president's private parts\nAnd that network let this run network didn't censor it network didn't cancel a show and wait it gets even worse the sponsors didn't cancel the show the same sponsors that will not broadcast will not advertised on TALK radio\nI don't know
