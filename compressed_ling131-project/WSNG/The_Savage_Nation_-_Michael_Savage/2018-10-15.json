a mad this time of total man this because there's no history is like a mass I called that mass hysteria but there's mass amnesia actually the countries involved in a mass amnesia they don't have no idea of their own history literal literal in the history of human suffering the history of the world the history of survival nothing zero\nSo the only a Bernie Sanders the most dangerous man in American history\nWas mobilizing the idiotic used to ride in the streets\nAnd then you got a this there's CBS debate with Trump predictable I'm supposed to city or in Trump got the best of or I didn't watch it so I Can't say that I Do know that he missed one particular point that he should have given when she brought up the global warming issue\nAnd uh he sent something because he didn't have the facts you should have had me as an expert there because I've tried to give them books and apparently as a random yet because I'm not on Fox News he apparently only a reads and listens to things from people on Fox News so they're debating the global warming thing\nAnd he says well I don't know it's not caused by man\nAnd blah blah blah and millions of years ago he didn't know is facts very well this was embarrassing because he could've nailed to across when she said to me but what about the scientists say there is global warming caused by man if he had only listen to me in rent government zero which I gave them in person and Trump's war ... gave him in person\nAnd I sent copies or stop mass hysteria which went to the dead letter box\nBecause only those on Fox News get to the inner circle now\nHe would have read about the Vostok ice core samples and he would have had the information the trap Leslie stall with logic and with science but you can't just keep be asking people and wind begging them\nBecause it's not selling oh short sales to the ... people in the ... folk but does it sell to the great mass of middle ground that we need in order to hold on to Congress that's all we need to be talking to the educated people who say undecided I'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat\nThat's the audience that I represent that's the audience I talked to Silvio research the Vostok ice core samples in thirty seconds or less what did they show now those of you who read government zero all know the answer\nAnswer is very simple a team of five\nThe last what did they show now those of you who read government zero know the answer\nAnswer is very simple a team of five five nation sciences from five nations you went to sleep already I Know they drill down five miles into the coldest place on earth and foster in the Antarctic coldest place in the earth they drill down five miles into the ice core why\nThey pulled up the sample from five miles below the earth or the ice and then they analyze that ice core sample and what did they find\nThey found that the earth was warmer millennia ago and there was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere millennia go that tends to disprove the entire theory\nThat man is destroying the earth through global warming now having said that\nI've worked all of my adult life to make this a clean or as clean a fleet of land in the water

almost like a perfect description of what's happening in America and there's some title may be the the key America's insanity from the Salem witch trials for the Trump which on let's talk about the Salem witch trials how does that correlate to what's happening today\nWell the Salem witch trials are usually misunderstood it's when a group of young girls became a South Africa and started accusing women are being which is a matter of being which has things like that you know\nAnd it wound up ... people were killed as a result of it it was false accusations that we've come to the Trump which on first they started with Russia collusion that Mueller dropped that because there was nothing there then you switch to something else and then we moved on to the cabin or hearings where we started this and Christian man\nI'm Sorry to use the phrase he was crucified by the by the by the left and the rest is history as a Supreme Court justice but\nGovernor they've done that to an awful lot of people and driven them out of the media driven a matter of a university is driven him out of the corporations and that is what I mean by a witch hunt\nUnfounded hysteria based upon lies or here say with no evidence the opposite of American Jurisprudence\nDo you think that many of the people behind the hysteria do they actually believe what they're saying or is it just their rhetorical tool or because they lost an election they're out of power and they're using this just to create disruption without really a goal in mind\nYou know there are always rules for the game you didn't go outside the field and when when you're on the field you didn't kick the demand and the growing or when he was walking away from you hit him in the back of the head with a stick those rules are all changed by the Democrats are persecuted Kavanaugh hitting them in the back of the head Dianne Feinstein instead of releasing this letter\nFrom Dr fraud I call her a\nInstead of releasing them during the hearing

planted papers in his desk and said he was a spy working with Germany completely fake he was found guilty Dreyfuss was sent to demos island you may remember the movie with a Dustin Hoffman escape from devils island or something like that well it turns out the whole thing was faith based upon planted evidence\nAnd it took a hundred years to exonerate captain Dreyfuss looked like they just did the capital is very similar\nTo what they did to Dreyfuss I don't trust is Dr Freud or forward whatever her name as ... as you probably know that they're going to try to impeach him now if they take back the house can you believe this is there anyone viewing\nGovernor Huckabee's program right now who does not want the hysteria in our streets to stop is there anyone listening to the show oh things is a good idea to chase people\nDown the street to beat people up in the street ... what kind of world that we're living in this is not a society that is civil it is an under civil society and the Hillary
