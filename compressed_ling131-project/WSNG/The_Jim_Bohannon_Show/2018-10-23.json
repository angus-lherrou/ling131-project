Savage dot com at the hordes of people coming over\nAnd Ninety nine percent of them are young men of military age in great shape and they look hard as nails and I'm starting to ask myself that question that's not been asked by anyone including America's anchor ham which is it look somewhat to me like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami\nIt looks like the Mariel boat invasion in Miami in the eighties and I'm starting to ask and maybe someone out there can answer this may be a border patrol member who's caught some of these people before\nDid Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador empty their prisons and then not houses where are these guys coming from where do you get fourteen thousand young men of military age because suddenly walk for thirty forty days where are they from so they have no jobs in their own country they're in great shape they're healthy\nThey looked like they've been eating well they're washed their clothing is clean they're not homeless their sneakers a brand new it looks like the Mariel boat invasion\nAnd uh I have a housekeeper from El Salvador great woman I've known her for Twenty years and she said to him I asked her what she was watching Trump's speech last yesterday after the show\nI said what do you think she said to me I should say Michael she said there's no problems in Honduras which have that debate she just said quietly there no problems in Honduras she says she shrugged their shoulders\nDon't you people go there and vacations to study iguanas and do like a line jumping on whatever ... you know you got a line between ... isn't that what you go to Honduras to have a good time I don't know when the ... all of a sudden they become a a dangerous place all of a sudden\nSo why is Trump not stopping the caravan mean were screaming for help the people are screaming out to the man we elected because he said he would do this now it's true we have a little time but you know this is going to take a lotta time to build that a barrier in Mexico\nWe're not talking about a structure we're talking about the Mexican government\nPutting a patrol cars tanks whenever they need to do a and build a natural barrier and funneled uh people into that natural barrier and not let them go forward that's what has to happen but Mexico doesn't want to do it for two reasons they don't want them there\nNever forget what Trump was elected on he was elected on stopping the flood of immigrants coming into America I don't care what else you may have voted for that's the number one issue that he took and ran with right well this is now his moment so how does he stop the human wave\nWell is a ... a thought that's a little troubling it doesn't really matter what Trump does\nIf he sends the military to the border the vermin and the media will follow and they will make their pictures and videos and frame interviews with women and children to fit their sick narrative and will make it look like Trump their military the border patrol the Republicans are all evil white men\nResorting to drastic measures to keep brown mothers and children from a better life in America you can you can bet your Social Security on that they did the same thing with the

and El Salvador empty their prisons and they're not houses it's a rational question that needs to be asked and answered I'm\nNot going to rely upon politicians to answer anything I'm not relying upon the fake news to answer anything I'm going to rely upon the Savage Nation 'cause I had a call yesterday\nWho's an undercover DEA operative who told me what's going on on the border by the way if you hear my poor dog coughing in the background that as the mascot at the Savage Nation little chatty he just came\nWho told me what's going on on the border by the way if you hear my poor dog coughing in the background that is the mascot the Savage Nation little chatty he just came back he's Fifteen Years old been with us from the beginning remember he was on stage with me at the chronicle prevent him when he was a little black\nPoodle and uh\nHe has his issues what he's doing fine just came from the vet and she did an X ray and he has no fluent on his lungs and no sign of anything see just getting older like you and that's it so that's what it is life goes on so America's getting older\nAnd the older people in America are losing their will to live and they don't know what to do they came out to the polls and the last election with one last hope that one last candidate who was not a politician would save the country\nAnd thus far they're not sure what's going on they love the rallies they love the speeches they like many of the policies they thank God the truck that Trump is there and she is not there but they don't know why he's not doing anything more visual for them with regard to the border\nThey don't know why\nIs one thing to give a speech with Ted Cruz and inspire people that's very important but I think the next thing you need to follow it up with some action because each day that we lose is a day we can't replace\nIf you see an army coming what is general do\nLet's just put it in military terms with or without weapons you see an army marching towards your frontier what does that general do what are you taught military academy you sit there and give speeches or you'll line up your troops you built fortifications you build barricade what do you do when you see an army coming to you to border\nYou can't just when it gets real your way through this the whole world is watching\nAnd the entire nation and our future is on the line I Know you've heard this before but this is so clear to me now I've tried to visualize this for many of you and some of you got it that's why I'm Still successfully after twenty five years in radio while you're still make my books best sellers\nAnd thank you for doing that will stop mass hysteria without any promotion whatsoever except on this program and very very little else do you see of\nThe most prominent conservative writer in America right on me but you don't see me because I don't have a TV shows you got to understand the people do listen to this program and we are very important and the government than in the world and my ideas are not last they'll listen to but they're not being acted upon right now is good enough that I helped elect Donald Trump now we need to help Donald Trump protect us\nFrom the invasion of the new Mariel boat invasion whether it is or not I don't know what would you do to stop this mass of humanity coming to our borders\n[noise]\nNo but because I'm not quoted by anyone for commercial reasons for competitive reasons really\nThe idea is not yet been talked about but it will be I help my students producers listening after you I Know she does every day to give a the bow tie a little info for tonight maybe the bow tie can rip it off\nAnd like loud sue it doesn't really matter at this stage in my career who reps that often at the end of the day as long as my ideas a thought about I'm really happy so they ripped off the word hysteria but try to create hysteria but I put together three words stop mass hysteria\nAnd then for a while you heard the words hysteria being used and they realize they might be helping me so they stop Syria's trying to come up with a new word for hysteria they don't know what to do with that so now there's a new idea that I've come up with I have an idea Smith and should Trump threatened withdraw from the new NAFTA Mexico failed to stop the invasion it makes sense to me it's a good strategy\nIf I were in Donald Trump's kitchen cabinet\nHaving a Diet Coke and an ice cream with them\nI Would suggest the same thing\nI Will say he's such an intuitively intelligent man and a man of action they say you know this is a good idea let's do it that's how he would work\nHe would work I say if I was with it but I'm not invited\nI'm not invited because I'm not part of the Fox news gang and it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to\nParticularly that educated genius\nOf who speaks twice a day and his eyes and everything probably advise on things we can't even imagine given his lack of education they probably are considered even smarter than people who actually study these things given his lack of international knowledge he's probably considered a better diplomats and train diplomats\nGiven his lack of the use of even the English language properly probably considered a better linguist\nOr then linguists so I I wouldn't doubt that um it would be received with\nWith a very vacate very few interest by the president he actually heard it but ever since they put pockmarked in there I don't know\nThe ... with with a very vacate very keen interest by the president be actually heard it\nBut ever since they put pockmarked in there I don't know but since ... went in there I don't know that anything I say is being heard that was the last straw I mean once they put cocky in there it was all over how can you take people from one network and use them and you were administration exclusively then Obama ever do anything like that\nYou know I'm a bracing a very sensitive issue right now in the middle of all of this is not even personal it's worrisome to me why if Obama had hired the former director of I don't know CNN let's say let's take CNN what if we woke up and said oh she Obama's talking to a Wolf Blitzer every night twice tonight on telephone\nAnd Wolf Blitzer is the only one advise them if this went on for years let's say a whole year no or then the the guy who was fired from CNN ... imaginary uh guys fired from CNN has no job the next thing you know he's communications director for Obama tell me what tongues would be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how could you sort of thing you can't be blind to what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that not only we we the core base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we've become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if we're blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independence I am and that's why I sometimes a great many of you people who wear the hats\nForwards and backwards it upside down even on Sundays because you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist\nThere are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean that means I have to be critical times even of the man that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple\nIf you have a family member who you think is making a mistake socially or economically or in business\nAnd you say wait a minute that's not a good idea Johnny can't do that because his was libel to happen that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other whereas this blind loyalty this idea of blind loyalty coming from\nThat's not the world I grew up in I grew up in a world of free thinking and vigorous debate\nThat's actually a very American I have free thinking and vigorous debate\nThose all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution and the bill of rights free thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window right now people have circle the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians\nYou know what I'm saying that's what it's come down to stay here stay here in the inner circle in the ... though the wagons I used to call them Calistoga wagons but the ... circle then all of us wearing the hats off to stand in the middle and we have to wait for the flaming arrows to go flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms\nAnd I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise\nYou'll get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total of breakdown of the society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just pulled it for myself and my own head because that's what we need to hear more about we did have more people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together give peace a chance let's\nCertainly listen to the other side not the ones who are pushing and shoving hit them back hotter as my position\nShe I say if we go low and they kick us kicked them even harder kicked them into the gutter it's that simple we go low they kick us and they got to kick them how to take them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people that want to rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something missed the liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men\nFrom the Central America that come into this country right now do you think that would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco so liberal you'd be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money\nThere may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash you think that they like seeing the windows broken out on their cars when they go to a restaurant you think they like seeing them as managing the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption\nThat they like seeing the windows broken out on their cars when they go to a restaurant you think they like seeing them as managing the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or the advent as avenue is so broken up due to contract corruption that stores going out of business you'd think they don't see this\nThey don't see if they do see it\nAnd they said to me with a few times I run into and talk to them is that can't say anything because most of my customers are liberals they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nAnd no none of them want the illegals here\nNone of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country on screens on vetted some of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be disease\nAnd certainly the social service systems which are already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more of them that would be a complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you so I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say forced to stop the roads\nBecause ah I have a bit of the Confucius of a bit of Confucius is gene pool of me which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is the feed the Confucius within and the Confucius within said we can stop this invasion from Central America without firing a shot\nWithout even launching the troop I Want you to think I Want you to think about this the lounge suit were alive he would have me as an advisor\nDonald Trump should absolutely understand he needs to reach out from behind his TV circle of advisors he needs to reach beyond that little world of people talking to each other every day with the same stories in the same mindset and the same pack phrases\nNeeds to reach out to the western regions of this great empire of his and he needs to speak to the leading intellectual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will be\nAnd understand that I just said Trump can stop this invasion without lifting a finger and firing a shot always got to do is lift the phone I'll be right back\nJoined us Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage
