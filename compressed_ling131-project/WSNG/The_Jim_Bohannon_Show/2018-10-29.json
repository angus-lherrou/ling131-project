are a lot of people were ... the Democratic party um the fact that he has become a symbol it's not an accent that the fact that ah they're propagating this also that he is funding the caravan\nA is an effort to to give birth to this uh this blood libel that that uh Jews are bringing in ... of the country that bring other people to\nDilute the purity of the country it's an ancient headed stop right there stop right there\nIs one of the greatest libel I've ever heard in my life and it's coming from one of their stinking as people in Congress this creep shift has the nerve to say\nThat these attacks on Soros are driven largely by his Jewish right nothing could be further from the truth and yet that's the man\nWho will be a very powerful man in his country shift a shift the one with the ... the shifty eyes from Southern California you see you can't hide behind your religion when you are a communist\nLike they are making that mistake about it George Soros is not known for being Joe where she's known for being a progressive psychotic George Soros is not funded tower study so far as I Know\nGeorge Soros in his little sudden they're Alexander sorrows so far as I Know and not deeply involved in traditional Jewish causes\nI think they are deeply involved in traditional Marxist causes from my readings everything they touch is against the nation's identity\nThey won world order new world order people those to him and his son so don't confuse the two and here's the problem missed the shift by merging\nThey're radical politics\nWith the alleged your religious affiliation\nWhat you're doing is smearing the religion itself and making the the larger population come to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins at I Want to go into that because as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly not speak to this\nWhich is where the problem begins that I Want to go into that because as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly Nazi to defense will develop ... developmentally disabled brothers or this or their seventies and eighties some Ninety this was a cowardly act\nThere was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know that of all places how did he chose this reformed temple in Pittsburgh\nAs a target he said they had something to deal with encouraging the flood of immigrants coming into this country\nIf you went to analyze what triggered this guy you know you could say always just crazy it's crazy he's also a cowardly the killer\nBut there's always a reason to incite a crazy person's head I don't know if you understand that if you study FBI profiling they will always show you that even a crazy person in their own mind has a reason for what they do I don't know if you understand that\nYou have to uh the maybe you've seen enough movies to even understand that that fundamental thought that even a mad person would they committed act of violence senseless violence\nIn their own mind they have a justification for what they are doing\nSo this lunatics that I'm going in after we saw the ... coming in on the southern border now you say what's the connection if you can't see the connection I Can't help you if you want us to the city or skating around the truth is that I've been trying to warn you about I Can't help you and I will say again\nThere's only one solution to this protect yourself at all times because no one else will be protect you but at the end of this terrible tragedy where this this ah Nazis psychotic\nKilled on on defense was Jews who had no way to defend themselves\nIt was that the police they were the ones who tracked into a little room where he was hiding they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons though it wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving a Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form and asking him to please join them for a a a a snack\nThey were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives and in New York by the way or the NYPD was sent to protect mosques [noise]\nServers\nNot forget that nine was shot in a black church in Charleston South Carolina June seventeenth twenty Fifteen I never forgot it church members shot as they took part a Bible study\nMainly older black people nice people bother nobody\nSlaughtered by this maniac Dylann Roof went in there and kill them shot them the same way these Jewish people were shot so what is it in the minds of these cowardly psychotic ... that they pick on the softest weakest targets\nTo make their at the rain statements that are going after ... people on the other side are they know they're always picking week defenseless people to attack\nThe same way the Islamic murderers target defenseless people on a Sunday afternoon or the whether it's on a bike paths in New York or a nightclub in Florida people having a good time always defenseless people\nTo the logical conclusion is armed guards if the people on on themselves then okay most people are afraid of guns\nBy and large most people fear guns I've seen this my whole life\nI've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves or they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there were those of us who understand the difference between fear and reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where your cats ever policemen in the in every home\nSo we come back to the questions of the day which is should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings or common sense would dictate that of course most schools have armed guards around them you know not to the progress of\nThe regrets of mine is so blind to reality that no matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer\nI was talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus we're talking about this\nNo matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer\nI was talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus we're talking about the fact that the media is the host organism that is spreading the virus we're talking about the fact that without hatred these media entities wouldn't survive a week\nThey wouldn't survive a week if they were told that they had to stop it it really took Jeff Zucker in a room\nAnd you said you stopped you're married and that's on CNN from spreading this hatred against white people against white nationalist because you just storing them up I'll tell you right now Jeb circle wouldn't change one word coming out of a Andy bloopers mouth or any of the other characters that worked for him in the chorus line\nThere's no common sense left is no decency left in the media so today I told you I'm not going to write the whole ship of state but I Am talking about why it happened in the minds of the Mad Men without justifying explaining to different things\nUh Soros backed group of regrets ... in Pittsburgh have the nerve to say the Trump don't come to Pittsburgh you not want that here\nSixteen thousand communists\nIn a group called bend the are Jewish Action funded by Alexander Soros tens of thousands of quote regressive Jews and now they're rising up and solidarity against Donald Trump\nAnd the board of directors goes along with this\nView of any idea what kind of anti Semitism stirs up in the country when the average person out there and they had to land says oh it's those Jews in Pittsburgh or don't want Trump there they don't have any idea what damage progressive doing so this nation they should know that after this killing to stop it but they can't stop it\nBecause of liberalism is a serious mental disorder\nThe rabbi wants Trump there the rabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mentally vent individuals funded by Soros his son\nIn this group bend the ... the less which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc I Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark with a two hour from the arc and felt the power of those letters\nAnd the power of the books and Moses in those letters there's a magic and by the way of power that you can't imagine unless you actually have done it\n\nWhen you stand in front of those Hebrew letters even if you don't read them and you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of a God have instructed mankind\nYou feel something that you can explain in other words there's no way to to explain that you see\nWell again I don't think we should lose the focus of today's program on the Savage Nation they began with and your ... many of your calling in this hour missed the opening to our number one which is a shame but I understand most people listen for seven minutes or so to any talk radio show\nI opened with a holy cow dish the prayer for the dead\nAnd I was trying to set the tone not only of civility but sanctity it was in the memory of those slaughtered in the\nSynagogue and Pittsburgh instead I get callers who are so regressive\nThat they bring up George Soros like he has nothing to do with the hatred right now\nThat he's innocent land when he's been funding these radical leftist groups who in fact are terrifying disease nationalists by the way that are getting their backs up so if you want me to make the connections between the bogeyman of America today the one that you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist\nI Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nThe biggest there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes I mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh yes they've been a lot of white nationalist in the ... in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around in America you'll see an awful lot of white nationalist went to fight and die for their country\nBut all of a sudden the word white a nationalist been linked together by the radical left into one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian hula a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to Nazi as him\nAnd this is a trick of the radical left in America they've tripped many people don't even know what they're talking about the things that if you are of a Caucasian background and you were a nationalist you're a Nazi\nNecessarily so so therefore we have to look into the minds of the white nationalist especially the one who did this horrible thing this killing on Saturday and I haven't gotten to it yet I tried to take you as a profile or into the mind\nOf that psychopath but I'm not getting there yet\nI tried to take you as a profile of into the mind of that psychopath but I'm not getting their yet what would make a man do a thing like this
