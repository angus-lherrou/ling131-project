whether or not the message when just that simple\nNow I realize many of you are sick and tired of hearing me talk about my book I understand that but let me ask you something I Want to ask you a sincere question have you heard\nYeah there is themes conservative shows\nHave you ever heard in auto rinse about Michael Savage on Fox News or any of the other so called conservative stars no you haven't so I'm Alone you're alone but the message is really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria\nYou will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we have seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday in Oregon\nAnd I put it on Michael Savage dot com it's a fourth down I Believe and it's shocking it's a video\nOf Soros funded anti ... took over the streets of Portland, Oregon\nDirecting traffic blocking cars threatening people didn't obey calling anyone white\nA Ku Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you had anti whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse a Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the anarchy that is raining in San Francisco\nAnd in Portland and in Seattle and in other depositions of extreme left ... that is spreading like a cancer\nBecause of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been fueled for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's University of California Berkeley thank you\nAre in a commencement speech three years ago said we're all just ruptures she encouraged people to go in the streets in cause chaos\nTo block traffic what does she think what happened or how about Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those and on the fought to beat up Republicans harassed Republicans a drive them out of restaurants I refuse to live in fear and I will not cower myself I'm a public figure\nOn perhaps the most prominent member of the opposition in the San Francisco area I Will not\nCower to these people I Will protect myself at all times\nI'm an old boy scout I remember the boy scout motto I Will protect myself at all times and if I feel threatened I Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city on my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with a Trump witch hunt has now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there's no tied to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there is no hysteria and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria\nThere was a witch hunt against cabin or he wasn't a ... not up for all white male heterosexual Christians was of course he was well that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very historical times and very dangerously hysterical times\nAnd the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car\nAnd too many houses you know what I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late\nAnd so I'm asking you to Savage army\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book\nWas the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be in Walmart and Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard this there at the books and millions on making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble\nIt's a purchase to be on the new release table between the night of October which is today in the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on a new release table or buried underneath other books on a new release table so it's up to you to go there and demanded the book they put where the publisher\nOf paid for the foot because the ... the most important of our side in fact I Would say can you tell me about how far more important book [noise]\nTell me which is more important right now is I don't know of one and so what happened when you went into the bookstores and what are you going to do with many of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have a dialogue with them [noise]\nAnd that's the main thing [noise] did you buy one for your liberal neighbor to read will they even read the book [noise]\n\nAre you taking my address and tired of paying fifty dollars per capita in\nMali John catching fire that's like ten dollars per tablet Ken down his thinking they had ... is a ... guys pick of calm down and get free shipping and pen topics are attacking Iran Miami drivers in Carolina find the the license can all fifty states for information going to ...\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that in the ... plant in the national security advisor ship position and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war in the worst\nThursday and they wanted war but for some reason the non global is around from\nWar of the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria\nAnd from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe you disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me and then we're talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or on a more intelligent level\nIf you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things in it\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon the you and for me for that matter Governor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee and his show\nHas one of the most loyal and phenomenally larger audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot wherever it is seen now last year\nGovernor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on a show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God's sake and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email it can't joined me because he's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he's in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted his phones are not out from the storm and try to reach us either on the land line or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for\nStanding with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackouts and remember he's been he is himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off\nAnd he rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope\nWe will do as well on the Savage Nation and there's no hysteria out there and none whatsoever the Washington Post says it's not hysterical mob rule not at all judicious timing I Would say well I Would say so many of my loyal listeners understand or the timing of mass hysteria is perfect right now\nAnd we're talking about that\nBut we're talking about the news of the day so Haley resigns and immediately later in the afternoon in right now we hear the Trump is floating the idea of a Goldman Sachs banker named Dina Powell to be the new UN ambassador\nYou say well what's wrong with that\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to clean the swamp\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to not be a global is to not appoint global is to high places I seem to recall that was his campaign slogan\nRight nationalism America First can you explain to me how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First name looks plane that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria or Russia\nPuts America First I don't think so and as I said you and the reason in my opinion that Haley suddenly resigned as because she failed to ignite a war with Russia by bombing Syria about four or five weeks ago when she was beating the war drums I don't know if you remember her speeches one bellicose speech after another\nAnd threatening one day after the other\nSo here we are now they're saying oh well maybe we'll put Goldman Sachs is Dina Powell and they have to replace Haley to me it confirms everything I've been saying that she worked for this government she was working in the administration then she left\nAnd it says Dina has done a great job for the administration has been a valued member of the Israeli Palestinian peace team well here's your problem\nHere is your problem\nAnd at the risk of igniting a write\nIn directions I Do not want to ignite the right\nI Will leave out my belief as to who is pulling the switches on this particular situation in the United nations you can't really blame them\nI mean if you were the tail and you continue to wag the dog for so many years as suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry tail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory is that are too complex for the average Fox News view or\nWhat do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned\nShe was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and\nTo attack Syria and Russia look it's a very complicated game the middle east\nAnd you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit there and ... say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out as because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have dragged us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America's second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist that happens is um twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east it's time to use that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that is why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring us into them\nBut I guess you will forgot that\nAnd on a personal note we know the Trump is surrounded by several factions as are all presidents one of the factions are global is like Nikki Haley like moustache Leo\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive well he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk strike against Syria\nFour weeks ago Haley was literally drooling drooling she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me none whatsoever\nISIS had been beaten back into one city ... whatever it is and Russia and thank God for Russia and Syria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city\nAnd in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in the clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city there were talks that Saddam was going to unleash chemical weapons on his own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war the whole world is watching everyone as an iPhone you're gonna unleash poison gas on your own women and children who wouldn't do that who wouldn't believe a story like that other than idiots\nWho would buy a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it don't do it don't do it I send message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they receive them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not the Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost to history I Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people\nThan it was a guy who helped push Donald Trump into the public eye\nAnd pushed him over the finish line he even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world from the total insanity\nThat they were and still are engaged and that is how I see it and then as how that is how my ... family sees it and I don't need the approval of anyone else in the media I Know what's right I Know what's true\nDuring those Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five
