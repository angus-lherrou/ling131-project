know the Mason Dixon Line is drawn after the Kavanaugh hearings there's no no going back\nIts brother against brother it's causing against cousin it's\nAs whites against has been on this issue and I don't know how to save America at all I'm saying is where is the fourth something that will trigger the civil war I don't know that this country could ever survive from what they did to this man during the hearings I Know the hearings are behind us and we have another judge but that hasn't stopped them\nThey said they're going to impeach him now\nYou understand what I'm saying to you they're civil war has only just be gone\nSo if you think you can now go back to sleep and go back to the Gulf and go back to watching your garden hose going back and forth you are mistaken I'm asking you to

what I'm saying you're you're comfortable little new middle class life will disappear in your lifetime that's what they want that's what they're aiming at\nSo ... what is this thing about cabin or that was so agitating well they mirror the man of couldn't have been as bad as they said and it could have been you\nYet so ... what is this thing about cabinet that was so agitating well they smeared a man of couldn't have been as bad as they said and it could have been you it could be your son tomorrow it could be your husband tomorrow it could be your brother tomorrow it could be you tomorrow\nBecause of what they've done which is make a man guilty before proven himself innocent is the reversal of all the laws of America as I and many others have been saying for weeks now\nBut what about the tide you is not been said so far as I Know by anyone on on Fox News or anywhere else do you remember the story of the Dreyfus affair maybe remember the movie about a devil's island where John Dustin Hoffman play Dreyfuss well Dreyfuss was a French military officer of Jewish descent\nWho was accused of being a spy when he wasn't a spy other officers that conspired to make stuff up about him as a result he was found guilty of trees that incentive devils island\nAnd the comparisons a of the Dreyfus affair\nTo cabinet are pretty strong because they haven't stopped the blood libel against capital justice the blood libel was kept up in France against rape is for very long time by the anti Semitic officers\nSo too are the anti Americans in America continuing the blood libel against cabinet as they have against Donald Trump\nAs they have a guest every conservative in the media it's a rotating moving field of targets\nAnd counting on my Savage army tomorrow or to go out and really clean out the book stores you know what you're going to hit you know what opposition you're going to get as you well know on band on Fox News because they're not fair and balanced there a cartel\nAnd only their authors and their friends are there ought to get on that that word that they are not obligated to put me on so I've had best sellers without them and whether or not I have one this time\nIs very important for America and not that important for me I got to make that very clear turn the music or if this is so important let's say this book sold millions of copies what would it say it would send a message to the left\nThat not only their books and their followers and their people ... what's that we count and here's the part that urged the one thing you've got to hand the left as they all stick together that's the one thing you got to hand them and they support each other you take a hack like that guy who\nThe Watergate guy the guy writes them and they say it's sold a million copies the first day\nThat means ... a million of the people who hate America hate Trump went out and bought a book [noise] why is that why did they support each other and why do you sit home and not do it I don't understand is surrounded [laughter] [noise] do\nWho is independent of Fox News and the articles and tiles Michael Savage left orchestrated mass hysteria over Trump must be stopped\nI also was on Newsmax TV this morning many of you saw this and we're going to get some of your calling on that which is interesting\nSo we saw the left wing an action last week in a way that it was so naked that it would take a real dummy not to see how evil they actually are not how they became\nThey reverse all the rules of law of ethics of decency and the only question is will this reflect\nIn November ah at the ballot box and I don't know I think it I think it will because women in particular who are deciding factor in many elections who are the reason Trump is president never forget that\nIt was the late surge of white middle class suburban women that swung over the Trump at the end of the election last time that that put him over the finish line\nAnd the question is will they come over again and large enough numbers to save America from the communist jogging or all will we start the same thing fascism racism equality\nUh let's see what are the other watch words of the uh hashtags is hashtags that\nPatriarchy racism white privilege or Trump Mueller oh abortion male a male supremacy a you know you know to watch words or the radical left they have they have all of their little characterizations ready to go\nThat Trump has the power to save America and I don't know whether he'll pull a trigger on it but remember Obama that Obama had his IRS poll the tax exempt status of conservative organizations he didn't like remember that scandal\nDo you know how many of those women in the street with their spontaneously\nThe tax exempt status of conservative organizations he didn't like remember that scandal\nThe you know how many of those women in the street with their spontaneously no one does you know how many organizations were funded by George Soros most every one of the organizations that bust women to ah attack senators in the hallways to disrupt the hearings every one of them\nWas brought in because they're working for these nonprofits remember it's a job for them that's their job is political agitation\nAnd so they are non profit organizations is supposed to be nonpartisan\nThe IRS could pull the status of their organizations literally overnight with a letter\nAnd their funding would dry up\nAnd it has to be done it's as simple as that there are ways that a non violent where you could face these violent people without violence and I'm afraid that if we don't we're going to have another Kent State probably in this country I sent it to someone over the weekend I don't know if any of your old enough to remember Nineteen Seventy\nI saved a newspaper from that time because uh\nIt was a significant year for many many ways I'll never forget what happened at Kent State university and the killings accounts they changed the course of American politics you see the radicals were agitated\nIt's an intergenerational group of agitator since so that way the old hippies of that time are still alive and they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that\nAnd the old hippies got the mobs in the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of a state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long hair rabble that was threatened to take down take down the whole campus all the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before\nUnfortunately the rest is historically factual and that is somebody amongst the national guard open fire on them and then others did little form of mass hysteria by the way at a number of students were shot dead on that campus one of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot\nWas that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their hair and went home to mommy and took a job and McDonald's there were no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this was going to happen if they keep taunting the police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing people in restaurants how long is it going to be until a senator who is armed and license to carry\nFeels threatened enough to pull a gun on one of them you think it can happen I told you I was in Washington last April or an to visit the president while I was invited by my good friend congressmen Columbus in from Texas and he he gave me a personal tour of Congress and he\nShowed me a group of marble stairs aback staircase into into the house of representatives is still has blood on the steps and he told me that there was actually a shootout\nIn Congress between a journalist and a congressman because the journalist has smeared the congressmen over and over and over again\nTaunted 'em over and over and over again you think it's new today there's in the Eighteen eighties\nWell it turns out that the journalists came to a Congress with a gun in his hand I don't remember his name is shot the congressman dead on the steps and the blood is still there in the steps now I'll give you another example you may not know this but it's it's history that's all in mass hysteria\nAgain those you know the history of those who do not know the history are condemned to repeat it I Hope you learn your history you're not condemned to repeat it\nDo you know that in the early Nineteen fifties\nA group of Puerto Rican nationalist broke into the gallery in the U.S Congress and open fire on congressman below and killed a number of them did you know that\nAnd so when you see the pain cats or the women screaming and yelling it's not amusing to me\nIt's a form of violence that must be stopped and the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now infiltrated\nWere infiltrated they're everywhere they're running the television shows they've infiltrated the university's\nThey've infiltrated the ... the peaceful front groups and it's only a matter of time until one of these lunatics shoots a senator or congressman and I think that we need to take preemptive action\nTo prevent another massacre in Congress as occurred in the early fifties when I go to a point at Reagan National is open fire from the galleries on the Congress below now what am I the only person in America remembers that story yes am I the only author in ...\nOpen fire from the galleries on the Congress below now what am I the only person in America remembers that story yes am I the only author in America who knows that story I Can't
