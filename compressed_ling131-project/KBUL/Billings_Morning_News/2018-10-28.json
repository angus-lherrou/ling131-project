World War one was just a couple of weeks from being over the world started to breathe a little easier it's suddenly see in the dangerous to read at all\nAs the world's population about five hundred million people came down with the so called Spanish flu that winter according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention at least ... million people were killed\nIn the United states got off comparatively easy but you know nearly seven hundred thousand Americans died of the flu that year it's a reminder why public health experts\nFear the flu and say that the rest of us should give it a little more respect\nFor a million ... breeds indifference at the very least and people just talk about the flu very casually and kind of true at all\nThat's Dr William Schaffner professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University school of medicine\nYear we had a terribly bad virus we have a growing older population in the United states and that's the population that the virus has its greatest effect upon in terms of producing complications in hospitalizations and deaths\nAnd even today I think the average person acknowledges flu but doesn't consider it that seriously\nThat Israel is a big deal and I talked to a lot of patients and families that say the same exact thing you said a lot of flu is not a big deal I had to wait before the flu oh isn't it just like the cold and\nI tell them that well the flu is a little bit more serious it's for serious illness and just a common cold\nDr gene more John ... is a pediatric hospital is that Arnold Palmer children's hospital in Orlando, Florida\nThe problem with the flu is that there are people that can have flu related complications and these are people that have\nMultiple medical problems there are perfectly healthy people that can have really bad complications such as unknown yeah which is a lung infection from the flu\nLast flu season about eighty thousand people in the United states died of the flu and ditch complications that's twice the number that died in car crashes and while some groups are at high risk even the young healthy and strong can be laid low for a week or so or even worse\nVery young children are at high risk of complications\n[noise] women who are pregnant are at high risk of complications their rates of complications when they get flu approximate that of seniors [noise]\nLast year in particular young adults adults younger than age sixty five for all so seriously affected and then of course there's the traditional older group\nBut even if you are a twenty two year old Olympic athlete every once in awhile flute takes eight perfectly healthy person\nAnd puts them into the emergency room in the intensive care unit within twenty four or forty eight hours of the onset of their illness that's how severe flu can be and we cannot\nYou out in advance\nThis flu season hasn't really gotten rolling yet but already flu deaths have occurred so once again public health experts are pushing to get as many of us as possible anyone over six months of age to be vaccinated for the flu were doing better than we used to but Schaffner says we still have a long way to go\nWe produce about a hundred and fifty two hundred and sixty million doses of vaccine each year or so in the forties is the percentage of all Americans who are vaccinated tire and some subgroups and lower in others\nWe would like all three hundred and thirty a million people in America to be vaccinated the manufacturers say they don't produce as much vaccine as we can put in arms or blow up noses\nSo it's just a matter of getting ourselves organized and getting the word out and having it accepted\nHaving it accepted is still a major problem according to a nationwide survey by Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children the survey shows that more than a half of parents of kids under Eighteen but leave that their child can get the flu from the flu shot itself those results are stunning to the experts\nSitting here ... I had no idea that the proportion were so high [noise] it's a myth it's incorrect\nAnd then I had no idea that the proportion were so high [laughter] it's a myth\nThat's incorrect but some mistaken belief you cannot get flu from the flu vaccine\nThe vaccine is made up of pieces of the flu virus it can't reconstitute itself\nAnd keep you influenza that's the injectable vaccine the nasal spray vaccine is an altered virus that cannot get down in your chest and give you influenza\nThere's no way you can get the flu from the flu vaccine you get a bit of a sore arm just as I always do\nAnd a few people get a degree of fever that can last a day or so but that's not flu that's just your body responding to the vaccine you cannot get flu from the flu vaccine\nWhen we make that flu shot that parts of the virus that are used to stimulate a response from our body\nParts of the virus are completely dead dead not alive there is no way that you're going to get infected with the flu from the flu shot itself\nOther parents were scared away from getting flu shots for their kids due to the long discredited claim that vaccines cause autism and yet others say the flu shot doesn't make much difference they hear experts saying the vaccine maybe about twenty percent effective this year but what does that mean\nIt means that and this is usually focused on the dominance strain of the virus for example last year it was thought to be over all in this country somewhere between twenty five and forty percent effective depending upon which study you look at\nIn preventing illness completely\nIn the entire range of populations\nBut it works better and young people than older people it works better in healthier people then and people who are immuno compromised and then of course as I said that number doesn't count the secondary prevention you get the prevention against all those complications\nSo far what we ask the vaccine to do Schaffner says it does a pretty good job as long as we recognize its limitations and don't expect it to be perfect\nAnd it triggered by the flu infection or immune system takes out and have fun trip cells in your brain that are really really crucial\nBut it turns out for sleep we only know about him because of ... said which is throw them all the fuss about Twenty years old now the discovery of this incredibly powerful population

Sea as well Nichols says more than half of them are undiagnosed but those who are most would probably have welcome to getting a diagnosis as quickly as nickels dead after only a year and a half\nThe delayed between the onset of symptoms\nAnd the diagnosis of symptoms for narcolepsy is about ten years on average and some people are waiting twenty thirty is\nAbout a pause advised probably that the patient themselves as not pushing maybe they don't have really severe no clap see they have no see but maybe it doesn't impact their lives and the way that it does for others say some people do have

very alarming that they said at the beginning and you're going to go to the adult so\nOne reason it takes so long to get a diagnosis is that most doctors don't know a lot about sleep disorders one recent survey shows that only a tenth of primary care physicians feel very comfortable diagnosing narcolepsy\nBut Nichols says it's better than it was Fifteen or Twenty years ago when doctors in training received only minutes of training on sleep\nSleep is low down and medical priorities is just were seemed to sleep effectively and what do you mean\nEight ... down and medical priorities is

that they said that primary care point and I'm not looking particularly for sleep disorder\nBut you know doctors know that many cases have narcolepsy are caused by a brain lesion resulting in a lack of a specific neurotransmitter there's no treatment to replace that brain chemical that at least not yet in fact Nicholas says in some ways treatments still looks a lot like it did eighty years

all the kids and many many adults can't wait to get all dressed up and head out for an evening of right and fun but why what is it about this holiday that fascinates so much and has through the centuries\nWe talked to a horror specialist and a psychologist about the topic and looked\nInto the story of Halloween to find some answers Ben Armstrong is co owner of nether world haunted house in Atlanta and president of America haunts meant organization of the top haunted attractions in the U.S\nHe says there is some debate over the holidays true origins is it from a Celtic festival a Roman feast Christianity he says no matter who started at Halloween has a lot in common with each culture\nOne is of course\nA harvest celebration it's at the time of the year where the nights become longer work starts to get a little colder old in the\nClassical mythological death and reverse cycle this is the period where we enter into gets winter so it's a start on\nThat if you will so it's both a celebration of the harvest\nBut it's also a time when the veil as fan and people think about the dark and I think about ghosts and I think about ancestors so it's always sort of in that tradition tradition of heartless tied with you know the celebration of harvest tried with the darker part of the year at a time when it gets a little colder\nCold days and early nights lend themselves to the feeling of impending doom men death than all things creepy and scary even carving the pumpkin has its origins in a dark and unsavory character\nThe pumpkin imagery is tied to the concept of the Jack o' lantern and there was a character named Jack who was so ... even the devil didn't want him\nSo he fed him loose to roam the earth with a burning ember and it was actually in a turn up even after roe mirrored with is burning ember to turn it and then when the Irish immigrants came\nOver to America they found a much better thing but it's kinda hard to turn on credit found the bunk and that became the Jack o' lantern and it kept the name of Jack was a traditional character in the story\nOf course black cat images are everywhere on Halloween and that's because they were thought to be just a million years of witches and very unlucky to come across Armstrong says that the holiday has traveled from Ireland to America and now back to Europe where children and adults both take part\nIn the

I I\nI'm not sure that pain well at here over the stain\nIt will um he got a couple of choices are number one um if you use a solid color stain\nUm that will it here and we'll cover it up it will also give you saw a color stain it gives you a different look some people don't like that painted look which is what song ... give you on the other hand it will last longer because there's more you be blocking\nUm material inside that ah which will help out dramatically or if you go to a darker semi trends parent I Would use the strip or on there\nAnd it will help you in in two ways that will give you a uniform color in a dark for because remember that's a Senate Trent that's going down in basically tempting the wood fiber\nSo we want to get that off and a lot of the strippers or you know fairly easy to use it the added benefit of that is using a stripper opens up\nThe wood fiber who would it absorbs more ... which will make a semi transparent last longer\nOkay but what I'm thinking as I Want to do a color through a stain to ... and I'm going much darker if they're really like color mhm and so I'm going to go much darker so I don't think I I don't know what do you think is going to show some a differential and color even though it's it's completely darker\nUm\nHow long has it been on there\n[laughter] it's only been on for a couple of years and when I say light it's like a almost ... ... yeah it's almost like a team like a real white a real white blond color coke and I'm going to go much much darker I'm going with like a forest brown ...\nOkay again these are both semi transparency correct\nWell I think I Want to go with a caller store or\nWhen you say come through you talking about are all like color you are\nThe are colored staying um oh if you use a set of ... he
