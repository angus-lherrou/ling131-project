you know always being assessed\nOr you know and nothing ever happens like if that's if that's the news that you're used to covering out of Washington DC uh yeah I guess I could see why you're

this\nCome on you know these guys it's not about women it's not about supporting women\nThey they only talk about women when they can divide our country uh but but he he's exactly right the Democrats aren't going to like it in fact here's the reaction from a CNN political analyst another one of the liberals on CNN here you go\nAnd you and I want to get your take on on Kavanaugh's outrage not two women in the ... the female clerks and he'd hire 'em and when he said during his remarks and I I mean\nThe now clerks I guess that's great have talked about that before it sounds a little bit like ... okay and I said before there was not anything really new this is the way it is and south and is very for our ended on anything that I'm terms of ... and his parents were ... I guess it has worked but I don't know that it's going to work to make women\nWho are so upset about the treatment of back and forth feel any better if it sounds a lot like pandering from a\nToll oh Yeh I felt a lot like pandering that's because that's what your side does you only pan or the reason it felt like pandering to you is because you have been ignoring all of the women who have already served as clerks\nOr you know in these positions working alongside then judge Brett Kavanaugh and now justice Brett Kavanaugh but ... but no you want it to ignore those women and you want to do ignore what the women who worked closest with Kevin over all these years you you completely ignored them and what they had to say\nBecause it didn't fit your politics so now you're you think it's pandering

the forests we've lost our far away and making sure fire breaks or their public access when you reduce public access hey if you got to strike out there it's hard for the firefighters they get there too\nYeah ah so speaking of ... deferred maintenance and infrastructure and you're pushing to get more did just deal with this backlog that we've got an all this infrastructure and our national parks and the laser Yellowstone and a lot of people refer to it you know some of our national parks is the crown of the continent for example\nThe treat it like why you why are you letting all the jewels

committee meetings where he just hasn't even shown up for the homeland security committee\nBut yet he's the he's trying to run ads claiming that he's strong on on national security\nUh so we know we know that that he missed that many but as as terms of big votes I think I'm kinda with where I think you're going on this which is I Wish he would\nHave missed more of those big votes I Wish Jon Tester wasn't there for the Obamacare votes because without his vote Obamacare will never would have never would have been the love the land and jacked up everybody's healthcare rates here across the country\nThat's for sure anyway so stay\nBehind her right hey well thanks for calling in yeah that's a that's a good question yeah I don't know what in terms of the attendance record\nIs on those the major votes but I'm a ... most most Montanans would be happy if he just frankly\nUh didn't show up or wasn't there [laughter] but of course they they can decide that this November or a next week as absentee ballot start shooting of it in your mailbox is if if you just wish Jon Tester wasn't there to vote for things like Obamacare to vote for things like sanctuary cities\nWill vote him out or

or take away preexisting money claims on public land but support her she would make a large scale mine in that area much\nAnd it talks and I'm Jeff how now building very whether ... news talk Ninety five point five\nPartly cloudy skies today with some patchy fog early in the morning a slight chance of snow in the morning in a slight chance of rain late in the morning and then a chance of rain showers in the afternoon but for daytime high similar lower forties or chance of rain and snow showers this evening and then snow showers likely overnight\nWe're not looking at any accumulation but overnight lows you're going to drop down to ride around thirty\nSnow likely tomorrow morning and then a chance of rain and snow in the afternoon with highs and the upper thirties that's a look at your forecast for news talk on cue choose Britain where crime and\nLocal news every ten minutes and when it breaks my talks with one on news ... thirty five point five if you just heard the news update their from Jeff towel\nOr interior secretary Ryan Zinke he approving a twenty year ban on new mining claims and the mountains north of Yellowstone National park\nAfter two proposed gold mines raised concerns\nOr in in the area the paradise valley area or that that that could somehow affect tourism in the area so anyway you heard that that news update from Jeff how there we actually did our show for those you missed it yesterday I was live the entire morning for the shells from paradise valley\nWe were at this age lodge which was the location\nOf where a secretary Zinke he has signed this order and made this announcement I'm so he joined us live on Montana talks yesterday in our nine o'clock hour and we actually talked about that specific topic so here as part of our conversation with interior secretary Ryan Zinke he\nExclusively right here on Montana talks ... agree or disagree but you know here in the paradise valley they have had a coalition kind of across the party coalition saying hey we\nDon't want to have money right next to Yellowstone National park because of these other industries whereas places like white silver springs places like Libby, Montana knocks and they're saying hey there's there's local sports saying no we need and we want these minds up and running so this is Lloyd agree or disagree this is this is what you know across the spectrum of locals are asking for here\nAnd this is why you have an e process or you look at the the science behind that the watersheds you look at the methodology you look at best practices you look at the science and you make a determination of in in the long run or with the interests of the public was the interest of\nOf industry what is the interest to Montana the state certainly had to say I'm so in this case of we're doing a mineral withdrawal I'm a because this is not an appropriate place\nAnd it's got the support of the congressional delegation as well when I don't know if you can comment on this or not at all but I I saw how uh well pass out of the house the Montana rhetoric was was right\nThere you know my former seat did a great job a supported it passed out of the house of out of the committee so you've got a great job uh\nBut I as I understand it apparently Senator Jon tester kind of what looked like a ... blatant political stunt here in the past few days tried to send out a press release apparently got wind that this announcement was going to remain so he tried as you send out a press release calling on you\nTo to make this happen I mean you know I've been working in a running along so I was gonna say even as a like this is talk on your desk last week I\nI've been working on this since I was a ah when the first I think probably\nTwo weeks of being a congressman so uh yeah but uh I'll give credit to say this is the right decision so uh it's it's a it's a team to be more fun of but it ended as political season right so I just got straight as doing my job\nBecause if you do your job your leaves you look at if you don't do the job if he has a question he'll call your two o'clock in the morning and and he'll keep going till you pick a\nBet yeah yeah yeah and if you don't ... of it too but a a secretary Ryan Zinke really appreciate you appreciate your joining us here alive on the show from paradise valley and I know you got to run will be covering your announcement here in the next half hour as well but maybe just some final thoughts I Know you've you've taken some heat from the left\nThe very same left wing special interest groups that tried to claim their pro access and\nThey try to claim their pro hunting they're actually mad at you because you're opening up more hunting opportunities out there you opening up wildlife refuges the hunting for example [noise] so I\nDidn't get any more like an ... or a village is angry people but at the heart of the matter is a public lands belongs with people\nAnd the people deserve access to their lands they also should have an expectation we're going to manager and managing as using fest science best practices version technologies and make sure that we have land in the future that or are healthy and opportunity for Americans enjoyed\nAll right well Mr Secretary great to see a back here in Montana and luckily I used to be here this is your office right back here so ah so you're putting in the office work out here a new and you'll have to have\nA final wash his little Fonda out here they have some a trout jumping may have a time to put a little little fly in and they got fly rods right downstairs from it is we made it a magnificent but what a beautiful day a week ago we forget sometimes how lucky ah Montanans are\nTo have the opportunity to go out and see Yellowstone\nTook a drive through paradise or just enjoy God's Gift to a great state\nArts so that was interior secretary Ryan Zinke he joined us for about twenty minutes that was just part of our interview yesterday and the nine o'clock hour of the show\nA yes vote for those of you who are you know driving into work right now and that's the time you're able to listen to the radio download our news talk nine five five app for your smartphone and

in your ear buds and you can listen to the show on your smartphone apps are definitely check it out 'cause yeah that was a in the nine o'clock hour yesterday that show that's when we take a statewide from Glen dive to Kalispell here on Montana talks\nAnd it was interesting he was talking about the uh the people who protest everything and attack everything that he does as secretary of the interior even when it's opening access allowing for more hunting\nWell I think that's because fundamentally a lot of these environmental groups they claim they're pro access but in reality they shut down access there the people putting gates on trails and shutting down access roads and trails that you've used for years with your family\nUm but but but ... but he talked about how they're just angry and Rush Limbaugh if you missed it Russia's a great commentary or this morning that we that we aired here on Montana talks we aired it in the six o'clock hour\nHere on news talk Ninety five point five and nine Seventy ... it'll it'll run again in about another half an hour or so in our eight twenty commercial break so stay tuned to the eight o'clock hour because Rush Limbaugh's commentary airs a at a route just before seven AM and then at eight twenty am but he has\nHe has a a great point about kind of a liberal commentator who is saying well\nYeah conservatives are happy to the cabinet confirmation went forward but but Democrats are still angry and anger is they'd better motivator at and and that's a question we've discussed year I remember when I had the guy from club for growth on the show here I said well what's going to be more of a motivator here\nUh do do or ... I I think for example anger may be a better motivator for Democrats I don't know um I think successes\nThey are for conservatives and and for for the average American out there I think I think anger and and dysfunction the dysfunction that the Democrats have been trying to to bring to Capitol Hill I I think that drives people away from the process\nI think uh discuss people I I think it makes people not want to to get out there and vote and get involved and then here here's the Democrats what did they do they inflamed there liberal base they got them all hopped up just to just to let them

to be\nWith you know we've got Dr Scott Sears from St Vincent healthcare joining us here in Studio every every other Tuesday here on the show we'll\nTalk health health care with Dr Scott Sears and today I thought well hey let's talk about one eighty five so we're talking I one eighty five with Dr Scott Sears let's take a phone call here as well we've got Roger in billings on line one Roger or did you hear from you the question or comment from you regarding when he fought\nA yes or thanks for taking my call era um [noise]\nYou know I I'm Seventy nine years old I smoked since I was about fourteen\nAnd uh you know maybe I'm lucky I'm not arguing that health issue well I'm arguing the the government tried to extort one particular group of people out of a\nTwo dollars for a pack of cigarettes a I think it's an overreach by the government this ought to be personal choices if people are against smoking can certainly advertised give information out and let the people decide but the government\nDemanding that change your health a\nHabits is a really beyond their reach but that being said what about alcohol causes more this probably than most of our war zone a yearly basis or addiction drunken driving and so forth\nBut the government or think about maybe you're raising a six pack of beer by you know five or six dollars Fifteen or sixteen dollars for a record of booze and wonder about or obesity\n... now a shoe an extra dollar fifty a window of the government should or are they trying to control our lives ...\nGood question Roger yeah in fact in some places they already arguing sugar taxes so I'm I'm sure this is one of the questions you've been fielding doctors got yours your reaction yeah I think\nThese are great perspective and great questions as far as you know why why tax tobacco why not added on alcohol and other than as an Snickers and it's a common argument too as\nWell if we're going to do it on this one thing that we should do it on everything and if we're not going to do and everything then let's not do it on this one thing which really is counter intuitive and doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it right now I tell you that you know based on looking into the costs of tobacco related illnesses the every Montana household right now whether they smoke or not\nPay an additional seven hundred and Seventy nine dollars every year to cover costs related to tobacco illnesses so my family who doesn't smoke and chooses not to smoke\nA is paying seven hundred and Seventy nine dollars every single year uh in taxes to help cover the cost of health care for those who smoke that four hundred and forty million dollars a year and healthcare costs that Montanans cover directly related to tobacco smoking\nAnd so um this is a way to re allocate a little bit of those costs to the tobacco companies\nUm [noise] to cover the cost of healthcare related to direct related illnesses and just because we don't do it on alcohol or we don't do it on a Snickers bar or on a Big Mac\nYou know or or an unhealthy eating doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it or for those things that we know are increasing the cost of health care for people across the state of Montana what\nOne of the one of the things and I said this here on the show before I'm In and I'm looking at the actual proposed are the actual not that proposed but the actual ballot language for initiative number one eighty five here in the voter guides and oh by the secretary of state's office and\nYou know I think there is some of us who say we just don't want more taxes period we you know especially something that that we might feel my target more people in a lower income bracket in particular but but maybe we're just the anti tax and so we just say hey that's just another tax so we won't support it\nBut but there's a lot of people out there that even some conservatives who are typically anti tax to say yes sticking to the smokers they need to pay more to cover all these programs like Medicaid expansion and we're already footing the bill for Medicaid expansion anyway so let's say they asked sticking to the to the smokers\nAll the details on Facebook\nJoined the show anytime my calling the room rocks cabinet company fall in line at four O. six to nine four zero nine Seventy says Montana talks on TV well am nine Seventy news talk Ninety five point five\nIt we do have some breaking news that just broke here during the break Nikki Haley\nHas resigned as US ambassador to the United nations I got that breaking news updates from Politico it's already up on drug report they've got a report from\nJonathan Swan with an axe CEOs a dot com and he well share some of the highlights it'd be interesting to see what's what's going on here because apparently the president\nPromised a big announcement with her at a at ten thirty this morning which that'd be eight thirty our time right now so ah so anyway we'll we'll keep on top of that story\nOr to give you the latest on that front but she's one of those popular people in the Trump Administration so we get that here in a few minutes phone lines are open for all six to nine four zero nine Seventy will get into your phone calls and more\nOf that really want to preach a say thanks to Dr Scott Sears from St Vincent healthcare for sticking around for a few more minutes here [noise]\nUm yeah 'cause we talk we've had a you know several discussions about I Won a five with color so over the past few weeks on the show here so appreciate you sticking around the answer more questions\nI'm ... years yeah yeah I Know you've got a busy schedule but em thanks for sticking around so the question\nThat the one of the main criticisms from opponents of I one of the five is\nHey we're not just sticking the bill to to tobacco smokers um because the tobacco taxes that will come in\nOff of this won't be enough to pay for the mandatory spending that's also included in I one eighty five so so basically all Montanans will be on the hook for this not just the smokers your reaction to that criticism\nYeah this is this is it [noise] it just doesn't convey the truth of the ballot initiative\nUm [noise] like I said before shows first of all let me just very briefly say what happens if I win eighty five doesn't pass if I were eighty one eighty five does not pass Ninety four thousand citizens in the state of Montana will lose Medicaid\nOr they will not have access to healthcare other than self pay when it's self pay bathe or avoid care\nWhich takes them out of the labor force a so that they can't work or or they consume health resources and un I and the state of Montana end up paying for those healthcare costs um Medicaid expansion has helped everybody ah the the research which has done independently outside\nAnd generated in business over forty million dollars less expenses in healthcare costs due to the Medicaid expansion\nAnd so we know\nThat Medicaid expansion helps the community helps hospitals helps patients if it doesn't pass a hundred thousand Ninety four thousand Mondays are going to lose their coverage\nIf it does pass two dollars of every pack of cigarettes is going to go direct into this fund twenty six million dollars per year will be covered by the cost of cigarettes that tax that will help fund this mandate\nSo your message is basically it kind of just summing up then is that hey the taxpayers are going to end up footing the bill for Medicaid expansion one way or the other this will just tell bringing some additional revenue from tobacco tax to help pay for that kind of a good summary what'd\nYou say there's a decent summary of either state thirty second yeah clear why the even more yes the state of Montana and we're going to pay for that one way or the other however this bill provides a mechanism by which it can be funded\nThrough tobacco tax through premiums of those Ninety four thousand patients who are on Medicaid or going to pay another five million dollars in premiums so they are going to kick in money towards it and\nWe're going to save thirty million dollars on what is going to cost to cover traditional Medicaid patients because we can cover them through the Medicaid expansion program and pay less per patient than we would if we had to do it under a traditional Medicaid so the bill actually does generate sixty million dollars to pay\nFor the cost of this program for patients and his quote sell funding or however the legislature as with all bills have the final say on how the dollars are actually appropriate it it is constitutional it was the last time a cigarette tax was made in two thousand and four and the Supreme Court upheld that just like it will this uh once it\nPasses All right Dr Scott's there's always a pleasurable look forward to seeing you\nAgain in a couple more weeks raised yellow encourage folks say call and then I'm also emailed me Aaron at Montana talks dot com if you've got some health

Joan Walsh who was saying that it felt like pandering to her\nIt's like sorry if you think this is pandering but actually this is just kind of\nStandard operating procedure ah here um so\nBut but then again I guess you didn't really want to hear from the women who support judge Kavanaugh you just kind of told all of them to shut up during this entire process because you had an agenda that you wanted to push\nA you had a a man that you wanted to tear down you had a family that you wanted to tear down a in fact there was that tearing down that drove of of the Kavanaugh family that that drove President Trump to say vis a vis a last night this was at a city official swearing in of justice cabinet took place\nOn Saturday at the Supreme Court but they did a ceremonial swearing in last night where President Trump said this\nBe half of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo bread and the entire family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced\nTo endure those who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified\nEvaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception what happened to the cabinet and family violates every notion of fairness\nDecency and due process\nEnter warm [noise] much always be presumed innocent unless and doing to proven guilty [noise]\n\n\nAnd when that I must say that use are under his door and scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n'cause that was President Trump last night at the ceremonial swearing in of justice capital phone lines are open for you for a six to nine four zero nine seven if you ever want to jump in on the conversation\nI don't know if you heard it but earlier this morning I'm Rush Limbaugh actually had an interesting commentary on this is one of the questions that I think folks are looking as okay how how does all this is the impact the November midterm elections especially here in a crucial state\nLike Montana Montana's one of the most important ... races for the U.S Senate this uh this November\nI ... I say this November I really should say this October and November because uh I Know many absentee ballots are being shipped out this Friday so in reality the election is next week the election for the U.S Senate and for all these other elections starts next week here in Montana\nUh and then we'll just finally get the results in the final votes will finally come in on November sixth I Believe it is but in reality the election starts next week it's already here military votes have already come and gone out at cetera um but but so the question is okay how does this impact the twenty twelve elections\nI mean I I think what I think happened is that I think that the left got their base so inflamed over this whole thing they they riled up their base with these accusations against Kavanaugh only to let them down in defeat at the end\nAnd in fact I had some of my friends on the left they didn't even want to watch the news or listen to the news on friday right\nAnd so I partly wonder if the left will have the reaction that the right had in twenty twelve remember when Mitt Romney was the candidate against Rocco bombing twenty twelve and member it was a a Bush appointee to the United States Supreme court Justice Roberts\nAll the details block looking towards October and looked at the three ... fertilization something you can count on in October to feed the ecosystem and landscaping the entire year all the details are available online agree magic dot ... products are designed specifically\nTo work in buildings climate so no other service I'm a guy who can deliver the result\nCome along startling green magic dot the I's and learn\nV. I. Z. four called new five nine sixty eight twenty three\nMontana is talking here\nThis views Montana talks with ...\nA more positive economic news out there we've already told you how small business confidence is higher than it's ever been a since Nineteen eighty three that's just here in Montana\nAnd those numbers came out last February guaranteed stronger now than he was back in February that's\nBecause of the national statistics of small business owners show that they're more optimistic than ever before the smashed all the records and then it'll just last friday I think we're before we close up the show we had the breaking news\nThat the unemployment numbers were at the lowest number they've ever been since Nineteen sixty nine well now there's this story at CNBC dot com or they're they're quoting Morgan Stanley roost Shearer Sharma\nHe was on CNBC Monday he says global investors are betting on America's economic ... success now more than ever\n... this year has been a story of how well America has done calling it an example of quote American exceptionalism so the so this ... this guy from Morgan Stanley\nSaying that the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors has never been higher I found that fascinating on a couple of friends one because he's saying that\nHey that other ... not only not only do Americans say hey we're making America great again but other countries and wow\nThey're making America great again and that's a good thing that the second thing I found fascinating about that is that American exceptionalism that that word was used\nBecause many here if in America we talk about American exceptionalism how great this ... this concept of freedom is how great this concept of America is\nYou know we get attacked as almost as if it's like some sort of bigoted statement or something like that and yet here's is investors across the world saying American ... back\nThere making America great again let's jump into the phone lines for oh six to nine four zero nine Seventy anything and everything you want to talk about looks like we got Randy in great falls Randy good to hear from you what your thoughts\nRight yeah and I I just think with the way that Kavanaugh I I was doing some research I don't have it in front\nOf me but that he committed perjury I never received documents from GNC the animal and there are I think that alone would just walk and we can ignore Dr hordes testimony\nNow which stores so cabinet and got documents from the DNC what I I missed the story which what's the story there\nIt was I Believe it was last year he said that there was against the mole and he got emails from them and then claimed but he never received any emails from the DNC or that but they found out later that he had and there was never anything done about it\nOh okay um yeah off to check into that story more um I mean certainly got cleared by the FBI background investigation but the yeah off the checking that story or silver to email it to me a Aaron at Montana talks dot com\nYeah definitely I just wanted to say there's a reason that I Am a liberal so she can go that are\n... and I'm Glad you know I thought so but I wasn't sure [laughter] yeah\nDefinitely I'm I'm a little scared by an appointment is views on women and other things but there's a reason that I think a lot of people would agree with the Arab side is that it's just a way that we explain away Trump's actions\nSo what do you what do you think the impacts going to be on the November elections because I I saw there was a a Democrat a political consultant who said that he thinks the Senate Democrats screw this thing up I mean what do you think do you think do you think Dianne Feinstein kinda [noise] kinda screwed this thing up from the start maybe should should released a letter back in a\nYou know back in July when she first received it things like should have the least handed over the FBI or something what do you how do you think the Democrats handle on this\nOh I Can't stand the Democrat either [laughter] I think\nThat the way they handled it an outing Dr Ford was horrible it was an obvious political stunts\nUm but\nShe needed to be heard and I wish you would have come forward earlier and been able to remain anonymous before even Kavanaugh was elected or\nNominated\nAlright well Randy appreciate your phone call that Paul in more often great to hear from you if you have four or six to nine four zero nine Seventy is the number and that to your speed ball and yet you speed down and yeah Randy thanks for listening to KNX at a great falls great to hear from him and we always appreciate hearing different perspectives here on the show\nUm yeah phone lines are open also we're going to chat with or we're going to get a phone call here from uh my buddy Seth Jordan with dog tag brewing um I don't know if you're familiar with duct tape ruined the dog tag brewing just an incredible a operation that was started by seven out of Belgrade, Montana\nAnd now it's gone national um they got acquired basically a was support by PBR by ... blue ribbon so they so they better national distribution network helping them out and everything\nBut he basically started dog tag brewing I'm as a way to kind of kind of give back to the community but also to recognize our our fallen warriors so on the back of every can is a story of a fallen warriors and then the proceeds will go towards the nonprofit organization of that families choice oh just incredible\nDeal that does set Jordan started out of Belgrade, Montana but sass involved in so many different things\nUm and but also as a result of starting dog take ruined you also get some good insight when it comes to\nAh when when it comes to you know how how other veterans can start their own companies and start their own businesses and become you know veteran entrepreneur Z and so actually later this week they've got a huge event coming up it's their annual muster\nSo kind of they're all hands on deck so there's going to be folks flying in from Chicago from Seattle from Silicon Valley and they're going to be in Bozeman at the ... to a theater of this Thursday\nFriends a lot of business folks and and they're going to be talking about you know how to help veterans start their own businesses here in Montana really cool that we have an operation like that you know here in Montana but I Know you know of course they're in Bozeman right now but I Know they do want to extend\nA you know the bunker lab operations across the state\nA success Jordan is now one of the board members for bunker labs here in Montana and eventually they'll extent elsewhere across the state so ah we should be talking with him any second here\nI'm ... joined us on the show a but then after we hear from Seth will jump right back in your phone calls to about anything and everything you want to talk about er here on Montana talks for six to nine four zero nine Seventy All right let's go to Seth Jordan on the phone lines now from Bozeman sensory they're\nBegging warrior and are you doing\nDoing doing great great to hear from you know just a little bit of of the uh the dog ... story and how you know you're a great resource for\nHelping other veterans start businesses but yeah bumper labs we've talked about bunker labs before here on the show they help that start their own company's huge that they're here in Montana now they got a big event coming up Thursday in Bozeman um tell us a little bit about what's happening Thursday\nShore a Aaron thanks for the opportunity to share the great word about what the states doing for Montana's veterans and um you know there's an event on Thursday it's called the last er and it's for anyone in the state\nThat's a veteran who has their own business\nThinking about starting a business or just curious to learn about what it takes to maybe run their own business\nAnd at this event or going to have a series of speakers access to mentor is coaches or learn from example from other veteran on businesses about their journey or we're going to be blessed to have the presence of our congressmen uh Greg yeah fourth day\nOf followed by a happy hour about five PM ah hosted by our we had a governor might go to a lot of great folks on deck and or if I may air and just say thanks to you as a veteran as well um let's get the word out this is for Montana's veterans\nYeah yeah it's getting ... can be great event and I know I Know talking with a lot of veterans you know when they get back\nYou know in in transition in the private sector you know a lot of them you know they're kind of\nThey're they're kind of I don't I don't want to say they're done taking orders it's not so much that they're they're good following orders you know it's but it's just they want to operate independently they want to be an event and operators out there and and they want to build something they want to they want to get things done ... a lot of them want to start their own companies ... year here and to\nAbsolutely I agree with you I think that the one thing that we see with bunker labs which um\nYou know again the ... the nation's leading veteran entrepreneurship organization it's meant to inspire build connections and I think that's the hardest thing that that still have is that we're probably the only segment of the U.S population that literally hits control the lead on our lives and we have to start all over\nA move back to communities that maybe once we're familiar but sometimes feel foreign and but like what you said before if we can give them the connections and the inspiration a I think they just want to build on intent I think they want to take the initiative to kind of control their own destiny at this time and their life\nToo if you had like one piece of advice for a veteran starting their own business here in Montana is somebody who started dog day grooming what would you would you give them [noise]\nWell I Would say that I'm for it I give you many and I'll Try to keep it to one but you know the reality is is that I think we all need access to mentors and folks that have done it
