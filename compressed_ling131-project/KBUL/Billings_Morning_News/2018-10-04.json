where Montana drawn by\nThis is just rich this this is real rich here so yesterday I think it was in the nine o'clock hour and and we had a caller say\nHe basically was saying saying well there's there's nothing political about these accusations you know the the the legal team representing these accusers there's nothing political they're\nThey're just lawyers just just doing their job doing their their duty representing their clients and it which I'm sure when this caller I think it was a caller from Bozeman had said these remarks there was a collective viral across Montana for one day to Kalispell as people are we're hearing this on Montana talked yesterday\nSo it just came out I think late last night the daily signal has a piece here daily signal dot com has a piece detailing the political pass\nOf the lawyers representing the Kavanaugh accuser share the same lawyers who are now complaining about the FBI investigation because it didn't go their way so they're complaining about it [noise]\nSenate Democrats are complaining about the FBI investing because it didn't go their way so uh so anyway um this is where it really gets read well the big story here this is a piece by Fred Lucas the lawyers for the three women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct\nAll have been on the legal battlefields have either celebrities or politics one ran for office multiple times as a Democrat\nAnother was a federal appointee of both President Bill Clinton and Brock Obama\nBut the third one this is Deborah cats she was the one and I told this to this call yesterday I said\nI said you realize that that these that the attorneys that for for Ford here we're scheduling fundraisers with Senate Democrats in the midst of these cabinet confirmation areas like you realize this right you realize that this all has been coordinated\nPlotted out strategize ... like ...\nThat's not what's happening in these are just attorneys doing their job okay well let's go to Deborah cats because the other two very clearly partisan Democrats okay well what about Deborah Deborah cats member Al Franken\nRemember he was the guy who played stew Smalley in on Saturday Night live I'm good enough I'm smart enough and that got people like me yeah that's him you know he goes from a SNL comedian to somehow be in the United states senator\nWell and member he he actually quit he got forced out of the Senate he resigned from the United States Senate because of a you know are these allegations of what he was doing a woman remember there was the photo of him and the woman was was asleep on the uh the airplane that we're heading overseas and\nAnd so he does this picture where it looks like he's grabbing her chest right\nUh [laughter] well guess who defended Al Franken Deborah cats\nBut one of the attorneys for for Ford here Denver cats has hit the talk show circuit speaking up for Forbes allegations\nEven more than this other guy Abramoff chess but she's no stranger to commenting for the media last year cats provided commentary defending Senator Al Franken Democrat Adam in Minnesota before he resigned in disgrace\nAh for multiple reports here so I'm now she's saying well context is relevant he did not do this as a member of the U.S Senate\nHe did this and this capacity of someone who is still functioning as an entertainer oh oh I see so so when there's documented evidence of something that Al Franken did\nDo big deal it's fine he's an entertainer it's okay for him to do it I mean he was an entertainer back then don't worry about it and he wasn't a U.S senator when this all happened for\nBrett Kavanaugh I wasn't a judge and you don't have any evidence you don't have any facts yet yet you're declaring him guilty and saying that it matters now is he's up for the Supreme Court ... yet you have the same a liberal lawyer Deborah cats who's representing for here was defending Al Franken\nIt's just that I mean we're so sick and hypocrisy here I'm One of the funniest reactions speaking to be in the thick of some of the the BS it's out there right now\nA politically or one of the funniest reactions I've heard of the political advertising this season was ... you saw Jon Tester ... has like a an ad where he's\nTrying to make fun of that Rosendale trying to attack Matt Rosendale because that's all Jon Tester does is he just personally attacks people or because he doesn't have the guts the courage and the fortitude to talk about real issue so he just personally attacks people all the time\nI'm typically was false allegations that's what he's really good that's his four tape\nBut the funniest thing I saw was so they they in his one ad they they show you know an actor for ... basically their portrayal of was supposed to be Matt Rosendale and and and the ad says ah it's just a bunch of bull ... shows him stepping into a pile of you know of the stuff that's\nBull is what is the ... of this like man Jon Tester's people can't even tell the difference between a horse crap and bull crap here so that's when you know they're full of it here [noise]\nUm yeah 'cause they were they were talking about bowl and yet it was horse crap there but uh you know any way Jon Tester's been in Washington DC for so long now that we can't expect him to know the difference there between the two\nUp hey I've got we've

to strictly man okay these same people ten years\nAgo before the Hubble Telescope what up were absolutely one hundred percent sure that there were only Jim galaxy ... ballot now after the telescope that ... that there is an infinite amount of it I think the jury's still out or whether we're affecting as much of the planet of the great thing\nWell anyway and that was interesting in terms of the other I think it is interesting too I mean it was just in the Rush Limbaugh's commentary there is that uh\nYou know that these news outlets don't even want to cover it anymore I mean even the the climate change climate change climate change news outlets they just don't want to cover the news stories anymore I mean even at even the MSNBC anchor who's the guy\nUh who had any way to one guy on

joining us right now who's the interview Kelly and Conway counselor to President Trump\nKelly in a great to have you here on the show this morning we turn a set of Monday it doesn't matter what the FBI says Senate Democrats it's like they don't care what the facts or when it comes to judge Brett Kavanaugh your reaction to this latest investigation wrap it up\nAnd thanks so much for having me and a big shout out to everybody in Montana beautiful state and beautiful people you're absolutely right\nYou have Democrats who said from the very beginning they were not going to vote for the Supreme Court nominee that President Trump put forward they didn't wait for his or her name to see the judicial qualifications temperament character integrity background academic background they already were from no\nHolding up a stop sign that has become the symbol of a party that resist obstructed now destroys good people um say you're absolutely right for those red state Democrats and I would put a senator tester on the list\nThey've got these got a big decision to make he's already said he's against Brett Kavanaugh I guess he's complicit in the destruction of a judge Kavanaugh all the way he was certainly leading the charge to destroy doctor Ronny Jackson's\nCharacter and integrity and career and upset his family a few months ago when the president nominated a doctor Jackson to be his new VA secretary so this is um but ... but looks senator tester has to decide\nTo go with the will of the people in Montana or\nDoes he does he go with his party which has drifting leftward which is now\nPretending that they care about the facts protesting about supplemental FBI investigations and sworn testimony but really it's only tried to do one thing here delay the process through the terms and not the twenty twenty elections leading vacant\nThat seat in the United States Supreme court or a an and frankly just delaying ... through the the twenty twenty reelection and also now in the process destroying anyone anything that they must to achieve that very small small small goal\nOn and I think that senator tester is not doing right by Montana and I I see what he does in his ads and I've I've made this clear to the president look at these ads senator tester says how much he works with these got pictures of you is bipartisan John he's nothing of this sort on this particular\nMatter um he would look past the three hundred initial opinions judge Kavanaugh has authored the response to twelve hundred written questions the more than one point one million pieces of paper produced\nFrom the course of judge Kavanaugh's career in public service at this the hours of sworn testimony to supplement the FBI investigation none of that's enough for Jon Tester\nAnd I think that's why you see many people disgusted with the process and disgusted with the way the Democrats have handled this process by the way including revealing the identity of Dr Ford but for the Republicans that woman may not have had her say she has to be ... to remain anonymous and the Democrats smoked trout\nRevealed her identity through leak and and here we are\nIt really is a pattern by John just read this\nPoint to falsely accused somebody or something we trashed them with allegations are in and then say oh well afterwards and then refused to apologize pattern from him a ... how how likely now is given the FBI investigation Robin how likely is it the the judge Kavanaugh will become justice Cavanaugh\nI think it's incredibly likely because everything that those who have been on the fence and they wrote and we respect that completely they've asked for a number of accommodations including sworn testimony they want to the left\nForward and that has an supplemental fashion that's now been completed\nAnd uh so they have to cast that mode I won't get ahead of the vote to the Senate cash but I think the prospects of judge Kavanaugh being dressed as cabin on the next couple of days are are very good um and the president has stood stood behind his nominee he has shown respect\nI as I have to to Dr forge a again I Want to make very clear but for the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee she may never have had her day in her say she wanted to remain anonymous they gave her huge accommodation and said ten or eleven days eleven days after\nThe article first came out she came to testify they offered to do it in California I guess her her\n... ah I her preening undignified attorneys didn't want that because they like the cameras in the ... lights they didn't want it to be private in California I guess they were thinking of themselves and not their client all said and done I think\nHe'll be on the Supreme Court and and people will have to have to live with themselves and how undignified lack of dignity integrity that they have shown all throughout this process\nAttorney Deborah cats so when you turn Deborah caps which we do when the big defenders of Al Franken\nA numerous times from somebody on the news is well how do you does your you know polls and you know how to ... where the country that will names I I've heard from women Democrat you're Montana\nDon't my brothers and fathers too but on top of that um how do you think the United conservatives heading into the midterm elections\nThe poll suggests it certainly has in fact the Harris I'm\nThe Harris Harvard poll came out today really\nCaught my eye sixty nine percent of all voters believe the Senate confirmation process at the end quote a national disgrace\nExactly what judge Kavanaugh said last week Seventy five percent of all voters to think about that that's going to be a majority of independence and a fair share of Democrats as well as Republicans Aaron Seventy five percent say that senator science I should've turned over the letter to the committee and set of holding onto it for six weeks\nAnd the two points across party lines they have by part of this tribe partisan support for that and if you look at some of the most recent polls the enthusiasm advantage that many of the Democrats had is all but fading away because Republicans and conservatives and lots of independence and frankly many women are hopping mad they are thinking of the men and their lives they're thinking about thirty six year\nAllegations that are uncorroborated with um self described gaps in her memory and again this is somebody I've shown great respect in different toward I said first and foremost two and a half weeks ago don't ignore her don't insult her let her be heard we've all heard her\nYou sell ... prescription opioids illusion through the ... only ... the pain and they come with serious side effects from ... to withdrawal symptoms to overdose there is another choice group therapy physical therapist to paint their movement and exercise shoes critical therapy\nVisit move forward meaty done this public service announcements brought to you on the American physical therapy so\n[noise]\nSo if you knew among these used in men do Monday the wind is Montana talks with Iran slanted\nHis side everything here was Montana thought he had raped a chat with Kelly and ... have a boy it's almost too bad we had that uh that commercial break there 'cause I think she she would have kept going for another four or five minutes there but it sounds like she wants to get back to Montana or self\nLet alone another visit by president Donald Trump here but we do have the phone lines open for you for six to nine four zero nine Seventy but right that phone number down because literally our\nPhone lines are completely full right now of course after we got that exclusive phone call from Kellyanne Conway at the White House counselor or to President Trump but you can tell the how closely\nAnd how important Montana is when it comes to President Trump his agenda and his nominees in particular heartless jump right in the phone lines here we've got Steven Kalispell listening to K. J. J. R. Steve didn't hear from you what's your thoughts this morning\nOr good show and my my thought is this you have heard\nThis phrase off an offer to as a cover phrase if you will is when people say that we are and what that implies is that we're smarter better\nThan you are and and and they don't define exactly what it means or what did you end up with any context but it's a good way to to stop a discussion if you will because there's no point carrying forward since you're inferior to us but when\nI see the activities that have occurred as a result of this Supreme Court nomination process\nIt's very plain who they are rather than a phrase describing what they are and the discussion go away I think everyone should look real closely at these behaviors and that should define who they are\nYou talking about like Senate Democrats like Dianne Feinstein yeah like that yeah\nIt is anyone any or all of that phrase\nEven joy they are I think is used the phrase if you want to\nI'm curious whether those but I think it was or was it Daniel in Bozeman yesterday who said well this this Kavanaugh you know he's a beer drinker of like\nHow how long have you lived in Montana I mean we I mean you can go to I mean heck I was I was talking with friends about all these great micro breweries that we have across the state and\nTalking about how you know every town they're like oh yeah ... got a great brewery and uh we both got one and ... out and do all the people are evil because they drink a beer\nLet's go back to President Obama's when he was reading his own talk about what he did\nIn college he was talking about the drugs hanging out with the brothers smoke you know nobody even raised questions about his qualifications\nYeah good point Steve good to hear from you borrow six to nine four zero nine seven if you want to jump in on the conversation as well um and it's really it's anything and everything you want to talk about obviously we're getting a lot of reaction to this news\nAbout judge Brett Kavanaugh especially after this FBI report\nHas been delivered back to the Senate Judiciary committee of the White House already got a copy of it and as you heard very confident Kellyanne Conway that that judge Brett Kavanaugh will be justice a Kavanaugh now\nUm but anyway day or so but not only were we're taking your reactions on that story when we open up our phone lines as for anything and everything that you want to talk about it of course this is where\nMontana talks not only lever phone lines open but we have our studio doors open also\nIn fact uh just
