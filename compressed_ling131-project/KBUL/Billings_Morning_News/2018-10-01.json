I was speechless I it took me probably five ten minutes just to try to figure out how when the world\nDid is that coming through like that and they showed him up side by side and I tell ya Rosendale

in fact he played it I think last friday that Lindsey Graham out of I Believe in South Carolina had talked about about the hearings and he thought it was the biggest disgrace of our American democracy\nAnd uh so you think about all of that that was going on and him to come out so passionately about it and then judge Kavanaugh\nTo adjust go out and deny these allegations from day one\nAnd he's still doing it and you got to I Hope I don't know if a Aaron played the the judge Kavanaugh hearings a statement or not an did he did that last week traps okay well we we've got some stuff the cover of because I thought his statement and it was a pretty long statement\nBut I thought it was in a wonderful statement in that\nHe set the stage he basically said that this was not just the hearing but this was kind of a a destructive process and it's gotten to that point and so we're going to play a little bit of that if we can get everything hooked up as well as trying to team up here

whether it's a tax or a fee [noise] it doesn't matter and we're going to get into this because John Roberts Supreme Court Justice John Roberts he talked about this so we're not talking about what his statement was when we come back because he basically put\nThe the the the the ball into the voters hands and said if you don't like it then vote 'em out and he said that back\nIn a while I Can't

Ashley I Believe it was absolutely and what she is going through the fence the wisdom that in fact it it actually\nUh I I thought it was very touching\nThat he kind of quoted his daughter and what she had said about praying for the woman and that's what we need to do we need to pray for all of our leaders we need to pray for them and hope that they will do what's right\nAt all times no matter the consequences no matter what the cost when it comes to that but you think about in his statement what he said\nIn fact I'm One I got a shoot I got like\nI think it's fourteen pages here sixteen pages\nOf judge Kavanaugh's opening statement\nAnd so I I mean some of the thing he basically just finally came out and he he laid the platform\nHe laid it all out there that he's been a you know a a circuit court judge or you know and his level and so he's gone through like the FBI a search and seizure or not just destruct\nBut he's gone through this process already through his other previous when he was in the White House and when he was with the other departments and\nIndependent counsel I Believe um that he was part of and so he's done these FBI investigation does she think those would have been flushed out the first time or the second time how about the third but where the wait a minute on the fourth time it comes up no no no fifth nowhere now on the sixth seventh time\nBut now this is coming out and it's something that happened thirty six years ago\nI mean you can just imagine everything that's going on I mean here wrote this down he says the whole the whole two week effort has been a calculated in or grit orchestrate the political hit\nFueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nI Believe that is true they are trying to Democrats are left the ... as I call it they're probably already trying to calculate however more they can destruct in impede the process been going on because you know why\nBecause they don't really have any more options they're out of options so what do they do they they pound their ... their hands on the desk and they yell and scream and then they walk out before the executive action vote that already happened in the judicial committee\nAnd the committee last weekend that happened they finally had there's now we got to understand and respect the process and that's how it happens but at this point they don't have anything to go on\nSo now they're just trying to impeded even longer and by even more time and if that's the case then don't you think if judge\nSo now they're just trying to impeded even longer and by even more time and if that's the case then don't you think if judge Kavanaugh was a monster if he was don't you think that stuff would have come out by now\nDon't you think he's already been under scrutiny and so for Jon Tester to come out and I just came out two days I guess right before a his debate on Saturday and said I just decided that I Can't vote for him because of this he already knew what he was\nGoing to vote he was going to follow the Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer montage and that already he already got his marching marching and talking points I mean he is the number of why I you know I thought this was interesting in the last debate and I hope you guys got it\nBecause if you didn't and women out there I Hope that you go and watch

Jon Tester and the state auditor Matt Rosendale debate\nCheck it out you've got to just see\nHow the smear campaign is going on but here's the thing that I thought was very telling with judge Kavanaugh he basically said I mean he said that were flat out well hey he's an optimistic guy\nBut saying oh is that I Will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process\nI think that sent the message clear\nThe Democrats are trying to smear destroy it destruct the process and he basically just called them out and said look I'm an optimistic guy he says I always tried to be on the sunrise side of the mountain\nTo be optimistic about the day that is coming but today I have to say that I fear for the future last time I was here I told this committee that a federal judge must be independent not swayed by public or political pressure I said I was such a judge and I am\nAnd then that's where he said I Will not be intimidated from withdrawing from this process you've tried hard I mean he gave him credit\nYou've given your oh no one could question your efforts\nYour coordinated and well funded efforts to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not dragged me out the

I think it was the border security one\nI'm leaving or hey gee Yeah John just voted in support of sanctuary cities you know he was at the debates and all I don't support ... yeah but you voted in support of sanctuary cities so\nI'm In the you know no matter how you spend that I think folks who are concerned about the immigration debate will take issue with that um and then was there another issue that he brought up the road early at the end of the day I think the border security issue\nUm and and then I think to the lobbyist castle is another one I also liked how ... you know in the debate coverage that I saw how Matt Rosendale talked about public access any specifically pointed to the Twenty one thousand plus miles of access roads that have been shut down I think I think that's something that\nThat you know you hear all these groups on public lands public access but they never but they don't they never raised concern when the federal government is shutting down access roads and putting locks on gates and trails and things like that\nAnd and so it's I I was glad that he he pointed that out when it comes to this debate because it's by and large the left as these liberal environmental groups that want to put the locks on these gates and trails and things like that so but you said we've got another bill and maybe we should hear from him before I get too long yeah\nListen to that well a jumping the bill and see if I get the phone here correctly bill from billings or do we got on the line here bill yeah I can hear you loud and clear All right we'll go ahead with what's on your mind\nWell like I hate to be dead horse after that last caller but how ignorant do the people making these ads thing that voters are for God said you've got to look at the person's party and what they stand for\nBecause whoever controls the house or the Senate gets to say what gets done and who gets on the Supreme Court\nSo we've got caster out here talking about the border\nWill get passed around here talking about gun rights and the second amendment and he votes to put judges on the Supreme Court that would do away with perfect man back and do away with our borders yet he just died in there with these ads\nAnd then I almost crow this weekend when Kathleen Williams was out there doing one about the second amendment now she's kind of protected when the n._r._a. gives her and a half and her party gets an app on gun rights so they must just think that we are the dumbest\nPeople in the world that when the un\nWell actually I you know I think on another note Yeah Bill a bill out of shape your thoughts but yeah I just\nWanted to make an observation you guys have a great day\nAll right Yeah Bill appreciate your phone call appreciate hearing your thoughts um yeah I mean that's hit at the end of the day that's that's when it comes down to is that you know that\nThey they're I think there's there's folks that are banking on the fact that that some people won't dive into the issues won't get the facts and we'll just take whatever whatever spin is either bought for or or published on the air which\nI'm On a on another note and I think a ... a surge here from KNX radio with us here as as we're at the broadcasting live from great falls lumber do the best harbor in great falls this morning\nI'm you might appreciate this one here I think no matter where folks are in the political spectrum I saw a Mike Brown with the western word blog here in great falls just said well good news we've only got about a month and a week of political ads left and most people are just I don't I Can't wait for these political as to be over with it\nNever ever thought it would be the way it has gone I mean in any of this and I don't think our founding fathers did either we thought we'd all kinds of come together work together and cross the party lines well boy that obviously isn't happening you know what I'm saying and I got rid of these as either way tester side or I'm outside\nIs unbelievable what they think we think we do or do not know I mean if you live in Montana you understand it I mean\nMatt side is unbelievable what they think we think we do or do not know I mean if you live in Montana you understand it I mean and stuff and\nYeah these ads are just absolutely out of hand anymore and I I'm with you and this could be over and I would love to see someone to take a stand and say you know what you get to run for office for six month period and that's all we have to deal\nWith this you know before we we forget about it and and the ... will will chat with you in the nine o'clock hour about this as well but I saw the news late last night were driving here to great falls\nOr the fact the Drudge Report the top story a banner on drugs which kind of nice to see something other than ... in the News New NAFTA a new NAFTA here we go to us and Canada this is the Bloomberg dot com story the U.S and Canada have agreed on a trade deal\nThat would save the north American free trade agreement as they try lateral block according to three people familiar with the matter President Trump has approved the developments and the expectations that an agreement will be announced said Sunday night so anyway what what have you heard and what do you think the reaction is so far even a longtime farm broadcaster hearing the golden triangle\nYou know I think the fact that they're even talking is a big part of it there and uh you know and I will say that as what Trump has done is he's really gotten involved in the opening line the communications we know NAFTA was not a great agreement for any of us\nThe thing is that is really back up our farming and our economy as far as any certainty that we have and that you talk about math you also gotta throw the farm bill in the same conversation because it expires Sunday and they're trying to get an extension on it\nSo that's the key I remember back when the NAFTA first came into effect of living up in the area that we were just pouring in from Canada you know and stuff and we want it fair trade and free trade and all that stuff you know so I I Love the fact that they're talking and I hope it opens up and I hope it's a two way agreement\nYeah yeah 'cause you know I Know there's been some concern and hesitancy ... out there on the trade front and in a farm and ranch country here in Montana but for the you know the thing I've been here from like ... the Montana stock growers and you know the agar women and others say\nYeah we're we're concerned by it but at the same time there there's sticking with the president through this cause\nBecause they feel like they might have a short term pain for a long term gain here because there are some improvements that need to be made but I in fact I remember ... wasn't it even even like former Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer I think he was not only talking about prescription drugs in the border back in the day but he was also\nTrying to use this trade issue with candidate as as a campaign issue but back in the day long time ago too so\nIt's interesting how how it's all playing out right now but I you know to to a certain extent you've got to say hey\nTo President Trump's critics they said oh he's picking this trade war with Canada and here we candidate\nCame and it all came about when he first started Mexico I mean obviously that was big when they have those conversations though now that trade liners that\nAh it's interesting we already bad with the terrorists back and forth with China and the Chinese and you know where we're going with that and of course we export a lot of our goods are our farm goods from grains of cattle and so that's important the big conversation prior to the change of NAFTA was are we going to get beef into Cuba\nYou know and we just had a delegation go over to Cuba and talk to their you know and kind of try to open up those lines again so trades huge for us in mind that I mean we have more cattle than we do people and so we got I shall we get\nA way that I Am actually in fellas county let's keep it that way there I Know they're worried about having more by some and be\nA leader in one and then go back home yeah that's right yeah yeah and well that's why you know I I had a you know the army friend he jumped in on this I posted this picture of the snow in billings yesterday and he said what the heck you've already got snow in Montana and I said yeah we're just\nWe're just hoping that keeps all the crazy California and the first share the snow when September

night but the great to be here in great falls got a lot of great folks here at the chat with us on the radio this morning that I saw the other day they had a big Montana history conference in billings as a friend who's waiting for the month and Historical Society was uh was talking about that and uh our friend\nCan Robison great historian here from Montana he's got a new book out about World War one\nAnd some Montana specific some interesting Charlie Russell stories tied in there so\nI said will chat with Ken Robin later on in the show plus\nUm some of the may have seen the debate between Senator Jon tester in Montana state auditor and Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale on Saturday Night well his son Adam Rosendale running for the legislature here in great falls\nA is also in the house we'll talk with him here just a little bit plus a luxury out of the state legislature here in in in our great falls lumber studio for the day with us as well to look for the chatting with him I Want to go back to ... and Steve Galloway here we talked about the economy they owned great falls lumber also have the Dairy Queen shops here in town so talking to live up about the economy but I also know\nSwitching to other types of lead legislative issues where there's been a lot of talk about some of the crime bills before the legislature\nUm the death penalty is is a topic close to home for for both of you\nHere as well um unfortunately a that is the what do you what do you hope to do with the death penalty and in the legislature coming up\nWell I think it's a necessary deterrent we have to keep in place uh my sister was murdered Nineteen eighty two for those that were here in the state or especially in great falls so she was you know brutally murdered by her fiance and of course we have\nGo down and you know fight the probation hearings and so forth so we've had personal experience with the situation but\nI think it's it's just one of those necessary deterrent that we have to have um even when you get into a prison population if there isn't anything to hold against them what keeps them from just killing somebody else in there\nAnd if there is no deterrent for for taking someone's life so to me it's a pretty personal experience you know we probably would have went for the death penalty back then but\nYou know what the point in time where there are some struggles with a crime lab was you know and some you know issues with processing the evidence and so forth made it kind of a [noise]\nYou know those are the cases they really scrutinize them you don't want to take a chance to let him off just because you're going for death penalty so you know our family made the decision that they would go for for a lesser sentence how\nHow frustrating is it to deal with the probation and parole type system when you have a case that I think a lot of Montana's would say hey that should have been a death penalty case and the cause me to the problem with the death penalty is we we we never use it is it a is it OK well even if even if in instances where they actually\nA sign the death penalty as as a punishment will they they never use it against boggled up in the court system and the anything like that so but how frustrating can it be to deal with the probation or parole system to have to constantly have you know these memories in these tough a tough things brought up time and time again\nIt can be real tough and you know it's a council to families that have been involved in this sometimes you know there's quite a distance before they first called Pearl [noise] there were some things in the air with this case where he was allowed out\nInto a pre release which you should have never been and governor Roscoe we're still learning yanked him back into prison that day when he found out about it but it's that initial initiated him being able to be eligible for parole sooner and then you should have been the benefit to us was was uh\nBut it's that initial initiated him being able to be eligible for parole sooner than should have been the benefit to us was was the fact that\nI'm having to go deal with that when it was closer to the time when it happened made everything ... fresher and easier to remember and get used to what we were going to have to deal with for the first three a current event that you know it's been every five years and\nThis last time you know we were only two years so we'll be looking at another parole hearing next year or so\nAnd Lola Lola Galloway a you're also an incumbent in the legislature as he has run for office again for reelection others fall um ... what changes do you think need to be made at the state legislature\nThought it was frustrating for me to know that\nJust kind of how the statutes fall here\nI'm One of the arguments that the death penalty as the let's just do life without parole for as an option that said the death penalty\nAgain I Will re enter a what Steve said we take the death penalty away we have put the workers that work in our prism in harm's way if someone's ultimate\nPunishment just to be their life without parole how many people can they murder then there's still just going to get life without parole so we have to keep it there if for nothing else for that reason those decisions will come down to judgments with your county attorney and prosecutors what they you know decide on that end of it\nBut it so I went and said that Montana code annotated in forty six Eighteen to Nineteen and\nLet 'em get to the possibility of life sentence without a possibility of release\nAnd this is where do you just kinda baffles me except has provided in subsection three is a fender convicted of one of the following offenses had previously convicted one of the following the effects of\nSo to even qualify for a life sentence without possibility of release you have to already committed a grievous crime here's let's say less a deliberate homicide so now you have to do something after delivery homicide\n[noise] hey Aaron's lens here with Montana talks getting back out on the road back on patrol [noise]\nFinally feels good feels good to get them get away from the desk get out of the studio get out and get to see folks in person\nYou know I like to get out on main street but yeah we're in great falls right great falls lumber I'd do it best hardware here a big thanks to Stephen Lola Galloway for hosting us are here for the show this morning I'm great to see everybody here in person to us just showed up for the for the show\nUh yeah so you probably somebody probably caught the debate on Saturday Night I was out of the big one river so I Apologize I it's it's on our Montana talks dot com website I'll get to it eventually here\nUh but you know when you get a chance to be out you know shooting guns but the big horn rivers sometimes you miss the debate or to that's just kind of how it rolls around here but maybe a cop the debate between a Democrat Senator Jon Tester in Montana state auditor\nMatt Rosendale well we've got another Rosendale in the house here I it's Adam Rosendale a legislator a himself a Adam good to see a\nFair and thanks for having me make sure I got there we go I got her phone here okay there's only four Rosendale and the state and two of us are running for Senate so easy on name recognition because\nThere's only four of us and so Rosendale it's like which Rosendale as you might be able to confuse the two of us but there's not some person in the west side of the state in east side of the state there's no other family just a\nHigh I always think it's interesting when people try to attack your dad is you know as an outsider and it's like hey this guy has been in Glen die for how many years now he got elected\nBy entertainer Eighteen years now you guys you you and you're all four years of high school the dos and drove forty miles a day just get a high school that I Love it\nThere was some icy roads to get to high school or ...\n... well the crazy part is that the bus wasn't running I didn't have to go to school at all and I drove an early and then some days I Would just ask teachers like the buses go out today they're like no and I could just walk out the guy at all I Want [laughter]\nSo I I got a kick out of this I don't know if you consider it a little bit of this we're talking to one of the commercial break so\nOkay your dad's known for his budget cut his flat tire you not so much [laughter] I should back up here so so you but you've already been elected to the legislatures also not only did your dad get elected time and again outta Glenn dive out of dust and county in eastern Montana's gained the trust in the back of his work then he gets elected at a statewide level\nBut not only that but his son gets elected to the legislature in Montana so you know what I think Montana voters if consistently said hey these these guys your values are fighting for us here\nSet for I think we're always willing to um anytime you're meeting people that you're not associated with when they see that you're willing to sacrifice something first uh\nI'm you're meeting people that you're not associated with when they see that you're willing to sacrifice something first to earn a vote he's not just trying to buy votes and whisper sweet nothing's in people's there\nHe's trying to earn it and he's already done so much for the community like our whole family has it's just we love to sacrifice so when they see that it's just really easy to take a thing is it's like well yeah there on our side like why wouldn't we like them\nSo you moved to great falls ... so you you had to kind of basically give up your seat and buildings because you move very falls because you guys are\nHey if you guys are ah putting some nails and your family have some nails you're ... you're building and I you know I think a great falls that kind of economic development is a good thing right to be a building some new construction and things like that here but yet it sounds like you guys are getting attacked or a for being developers\nRight um so we have two houses going up right now and you know somebody sees a field and then they're just like oh that's a boring field and then we have fifty four houses out there and it's like those are families that that's spreading the tax base that's creating jobs in town and it's just something we naturally do you know what's\nSo what's it like you get out there on the campaign trail your last names Rosendale now your dad's got the flat top you've got long hair ponytail dark hair [laughter]\nSo a lot of people that are like ... so so what's it like when you go door to door\nThere's really only two responses in billings it was way different it was just um the name wasn't known as much so when I went door to door it was kind of a fresh experience but now that\nIt's been elevated to the status it has there's only two response to the there oh I Love your dad and they're just they're literally proud to meet me it's like can I shake your hand and it's like hey come out there is a road they'll out here and they're super excited or it's get off my property [laughter] there's no conversation it just dies there and it's like\n... ... you can talk to me you can tell me what I did wrong it's like no sleep now\n[laughter] yeah [noise] ah it's like the Hatfield McCoys right now and\n... but it was really funny you were saying you'll go to some doors and people will see you and so they must be more maybe they lean more to the left when they vote and so they think oh this guy's got sales he's dressed in these cool close you know your dad was like more wrangler is you know there's always a ponytail and where's the school closed he must be my candidate\nAnd so they so they let you in the house and that happens after that\nUm the second my last name gets just even though I have a name badge and all the things I'm holding say Rosendale they just\nThey think I think it's derogatory of advertisement against them and then all of a sudden they're just like wait a second is your dad Matt Rosendale like Yes sir yes ma'am and it's like oh no you need a leader now that was like oh man like I Can't believe it got me this far so I just last time when I ran as a house rap\nDuring the orientation fair like you know everybody come up and say something about yourself and I waited for about a freshmen gone to like come on up and I was like well I use my camouflage to get all the Democratic votes so now I'm just kidding you know it was just a joke but there's just more truth to it every single day\nYeah so what what are your top three issues or you're on and on a for this session\nI'm a lot of it is going to be developing the base in the state we need to be bringing people in and having a healthy um\nBusiness climate because people do want to live in Montana like from all over the United states it's such a glorious states live and that's why we moved here um we got to keep bringing people and we can't be afraid that people and they're just going to bring\nMore tax base and just more opportunities for people in the state because we keep chipping off our young people and they don't have jobs here that you know that will allow them to have their families here so that health care and then go\nActually been a huge problem we don't see the effects is up close than as dramatic as maybe some of the southern border states but they're real changes happening because of it\nYeah the ... border security you know obviously it was featured front and center in this debate on Saturday Night as well as Adam Rosen do real efficient you're coming down here than they were happy and all the candidates out there or you know we have a little fog last night but I Know a lot of you guys gotta and men and women got a brave and you know some long roads or some icy roads here [noise]\nYou know as we push it push into you wouldn't think we'd be facing snow in September but that's what we got ... already October ... anyway ... thanks for pop up and down here to great falls lumber for a live show also in the house are old and we've got an interesting call her on the phone lines will try to get to hear shortly as well so if you're standing on the phone line standby we'll get to you here\nOn Montana talks but ah now we've also got a joining us here at great falls lumber and luxury or we we've long known is state senator ed buttery and of course an army veteran as well but then now you're running for the house you've got turned out of the Senate or\nThat's writer and yet ... Senate district eleven of actually served in Senate district Thirteen and eleven because of redistricting\nAbout now because of term limits I'm running for house district Twenty one which is half of my old Senate district what's what's your top priorities are in the house coming up you know I I think there's some really important issues are number one I think should be on all of our minds as revenue stabilization\nAre we seeing a quite a bit of a change in the economy so I'm just due to the commerce of is due to the federal changes or some of it's due to increases in decreases natural resource revenue\nBut you know we're task to estimate what our revenues going to be over a three three years looking ahead\nAnd we're dealing with ten to twelve billion dollars and we do that and about forty five days this is something that we need to do a better job with a and that's going to be a big effort I think healthcare transparency and finding ways to reduce costs to something we're always looking out we've got some pretty innovative ideas and what to do this session\nAnd then of course making sure that our business climate remains really friendly for folks that want to start create grow businesses in Montana\nAnd I think what's really critical as we do this as a unified Republican caucus we need to find ways we all have great ideas we all think ours is the best way to do things but we need to keep it together kid unified because ultimately the prize and twenty twenties the governor's seat and that's what we need to be focused on it\nAnd it seemed like in this past special session Republicans did they they stayed United held together and and actually the revenue numbers came in about where the Republican legislators said it would uh so it's kind of like afterwards it's like well why did the governor called a special session and the first place and and luckily we got that Trump bumping revenues ... thanks to the tax cuts from whatever\nThat is true and we did end up right on what our estimate was uh back in the last session and we're fortunate for that but you know we do the best job we can but I think the fact that we were unified\nWe got in there and we solved the hundred and sixty million dollar issue in three days we had folks in Oklahoma with a hundred and twenty million dollar issue that took them I think four or five six months to resolve it scares people to death I think some people that we can be unified and when we do that we can resolve it'd be so powerful and fixing these issues All right\nWe'll add much good to see you here with us a great falls lumber as well actually want to jump in the fall and so we're ...
