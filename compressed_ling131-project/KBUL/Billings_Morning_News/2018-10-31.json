Would highly encourage you to contact the Montana Family Foundation and say hey do you still got tickets left fear Bozeman banquet because the keynote speaker is the guy that you may have missed who spoke and ... the former city of Atlanta fire chief Calvin Cochran\nHe is the guy who won the religious liberties case the big religious liberties case over in Atlanta I remember he was fired basically because of his Christian beliefs well he just won a major settlement here\nOr in recent weeks um but he delivered an incredible talk and like I say if you missed it a village I talked with some other friends here in town they're like yeah I missed that ah\nAnd they're driving to Bozeman out to be able to tell them that so that'll be Thursday night Bozeman of course the president will be in Bozeman a Saturday or Belgrade Saturday afternoon so we'll be there for that as well uh but you heard also soundbite there from vice president Mike Pence talking about these uh these latest attacks across the country\nUm did did you hear this news at a Pittsburgh I mean this just shows the continued\n... out right shameful miss of the left in this country um so Jeffrey Myers is posted at Fox News dot com Jeffrey Myers\nThe Pittsburgh rabbi who watches eleven of his congregants were gunned down during Saturday services says he has now become a political target and is receiving hate mail for saying that he would welcome President Trump to his place of prayer and he's not the only one\nUh there were a couple of brothers who were murdered in the shootout and are being laid to rest a there were laid to rest yesterday both lived with disabilities a\nAnd received help from an organization called achieve which operates a community home well the Pittsburgh based organization told reporters that they received three phone calls from an identified man who was wearing an angry at them um while achieve that did not elaborate on what exactly the color\nIf they did tell reporters that it was anti Jewish or the IRS here's the deal is about this whole story\nUm it it drives me nuts when I see news outlets or commentators\nRefer to anti Jewish hate groups as far right they are not on the right side of the aisle layer not on the right side of the political spectrum\nIn fact the the if you want to call the far right the conservative right in this country is the pro Jewish a movement in this country is the pro\nOr is the pro Israel movement in this country the the conservative though right\nThe right side of the aisle in this country is the party that stands for Israel is the movement that stands for Israel that stands alongside um that Jews that get attacked not just in America but stands alongside Jews that get attacked in their homeland as well\nSo so how dare you commentators how dare you in the media\nDare refer to these people as the far right it's completely absurd it's completely ... uh you know it's it's just atrocious of the coverage that they would do on this to to somehow imply well these folks are are on the right oh yeah yeah the absurd it that is that as it is complete nonsense\nUm and and and this just shows that here too the these folks on the left they're sending hate mail to the rabbi and Pittsburgh and and also the protesters did you see those those those people who who protested because the president showed up to to deliver his condolences in person and the first lady they showed up in person to deliver their consultants\nAt the at the uh the synagogue in Pittsburgh and they're in and these left wing protesters\nStill showed up they have no shame whatsoever it is disgusting is despicable I Can't think of of other words to use right now or do these people they just have no shame whatsoever it's the same lack of shame that they showed at the cabinet and this is worse than than the lack of shame of the Kavanaugh hearings\nUm isn't it I don't know I'd be interested in your thoughts on that for all six to nine four zero nine Seventy a bench Shapiro the daily wire dot com had had a great reaction to this\nA story is well of course a bench Shapiro's not not only a great conservative commentator a young man he's he's also also happens to be Jewish so um so I've got that much stack of stuff here I'll tell you what what he had to say are but we had a lot to get to hear this morning a Harry Reid Harry Reid\nWhat what did he have to say about birthright citizenship now that now that the liberals are attacking president Donald Trump because he's basically\nSaying hey just because you can't do a vacation in the United states and then you do birth tourism and you have a baby here doesn't mean they get to be a citizen\nAnymore uh well Harry Reid basically endorsed this concept back in Nineteen Ninety three so it was okay for the Democrats them but it's not okay for the Democrats now\nQuite ironic there isn't it um [noise] uh CNN also I'll tell you more about this as we get to the top stories at Fox News radios track and force here all morning long about CNN is now under fire\nWe got a report of disorderly conduct in one of the un transportation buses a bus driver called her supervisor in her ... her supervisor intern called us to reporting incident that occurred or two passengers became disorderly\nThe situation happened just hours after president Donald Trump was in Missoula for a rally out in the muzzle airport\nThough these men were on the opposite side of town they apparently assumed the bus had something to do with Trump who knows why but they decided on their own that possibly the bus had been picking up Trump's supporters and they were upset about it\nFlattened when he said one of them after exiting the bus picked up a tree branch and threw it at the ... the other passenger body slammed the front of us who knows exactly why but the action to actually stop the bus\nBut I have no idea what their intention wasn't doing it but um but yeah certainly if they were they were outraged they were thinking that this was a bus carrying Trump supporters\nSo we've got that story posted on our website John King reporting the news for our sister station cage veal Missoula\nWhere is

morning and and can we put them on the airplane and say they're heading North Dakota here this morning to help out Kevin Cramer that important to US Senate seat North Dakota Kevin and I were elected to gather to U.S House two thousand twelve\nAnd Kevin is now running for that important Senate seat and not go looks like a good pick up seats opportunity for us\nI was going to say 'cause I noticed a President Trump is on the trail obviously you know another stop editor I write in your backyard there at the Bozeman airport in Belgrade\nUm buddies making all the stops are actually\nIs I think are wrapped them all up you know Columbia, Missouri Fort Myers Florida Huntington West Virginia Indiana Bozeman, Montana Macon Georgia Chattanooga, Tennessee all these places he's\nNot going to North Dakota so it sounds like that's how strong\nThe races looking for a Republican Senate pick up in North Dakota right now that the president says is not even including that on his on his final league rally let's buddy is including Montana I was chatting with Rachel settled for Fox News radio and she believes also that this is a clear sign the President Trump believes the Republicans can win a Montana\n[noise] well a Donald Trump is very popular at Montana and that the unprecedented to think that this will be his fourth visit to our state a sitting president\nTo our great state four times in over a period of less than Ninety Days is just remarkable Eric but we're we're thrilled to have a comeback or for those who are listening or their tickets available you go to Donald J Trump dot com\nAnd then you could look at the there's a link there talks about upcoming visits and\nAs you mentioned Aaron that guy she's got six or seven or eight more visits plan before election day just go to bell great Montana the reason that says Bella crate versus Bozeman\nIs because that's going to be an airport rally like we saw happen in Missoula that was such a special night the Airforce one there with that beautiful Montana found sets guy in the background the turning around and looking at this guy's they now I Know why they call this place big sky country\nAbout the backdrop will have for the president hopefully we'll have the weather that day and you look back at the beautiful bridger mountains it should be a gorgeous day for a rally and it'll be in one of those hanging rallies like we did in Missoula yeah thirty Yemen but it was well actually Belgrade officially the airport there\nYeah that is going to be a big one yeah you're right you'll ... you'll have your from your favorite uh hiking trails right behind you there for for the rally here just like I got to see so you know blue mountain in Missoula where I was hiking around in my college days and so yeah that can be it can mean another incredible rally what do you think is the one point\nPresident Trump should hammer home this Saturday I mean really we're one week until the election here in across the country with the one point the president should hammer home yeah\nWell gosh you know oftentimes they say there's no such thing as a silver bullet silver buckshot there's it's a number of things to talk about to boil it down to a\nA a closing message but I tell you that that that Kavanaugh vote in really stirred Montanans up it it stirred a Americans up coast to coast in terms of\nThe president's a standing with that great judge or the Republicans the U.S Senate standing with that great judge in and watching the Democrats go to a really a search and destroy mission trying to destroy a human being but you know there was another story that doesn't get as much attention but\nWas a very disturbing that's what happened to certainly to Ronny Jackson and I think the president or with all of our veterans out there in air and you are a veteran a thank you for what you have done for our country\nContinue doing using I think only to serve out there listening you know ... well grateful\nRight and and I you know you're talking about your days in Missoula going way back I\nMy mom was seven months pregnant with me it was a little uh working at the Missoula Merck putting a young marine uh my dad's through school there uh once upon a time in Nineteen sixty two so I'm grateful for that legacy in our family but the the veterans are very very important voting population in Montana\nAnd I continue to hear a veterans concerned about what happened to Ronny Jackson\nUh it it's it's an issue that is is is close to the hearts of our veterans or a flag admiral frankly are being destroyed or being tried with a and convicted without ever having a chance to defend themselves politically speaking\nAbout also another hero of the cabinet confirmation hearings with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina he's going to be in Bozeman tomorrow as I understand it as well also rallying the boats that just shows we get another big name coming to Montana how important the Senate race in Montana is next week\nYeah not plan to be with Lindsay tomorrow when he comes a lens he's a good friend and I that was a pivotal moment for\nMany who are watching the hearings Lindsey Graham articulate I think what we're all feeling Lindsay said what we were all feel we want somebody to articulate that and I can tell you some I watched that hearing as many Montanans did from\n... together like that hearing was literally about two hundred yards away from my desk and Washington DC I was in the Dirksen building the judiciary hearing really she just right close to my office it was one floor down to about a hundred yards over\nBut I sat there and watched it on uh on on TV there in my office and that that moment when Lindsey Graham stood up and said we were all thinking and hoping the summit push back on the incredible nonsense going on\nUh the assassination the assassination of judge Kavanaugh's a character and having somebody declared guilty\nBefore ever having any evidence presented a that was just outrageous and I can tell you when Lindsey made those great points in that hearing spontaneous applause erupted in my office because all of our staff are watching that hearing it was one of his moment of sharing saying thank you center\nWell we all were feeling at that very moment\nYeah and you could see that you could see it on social media I mean it was like social media has just a just all of a sudden just had blown up\nWith people saying wow and I mean I even got messages from some Democrats friend who said while Lindsey Graham nailed it there now because of course I Can't use their names to imagine what the Democrat Party would do little cats if they heard that the rats were saying well good job Lindsey Graham and yeah there's been some overreach arrogance justice Kevin uh\nNews talk

because the whole intent of this is to make the United states of America look bad and to make our allies in Central America look\nThat this is again this is an agency speak this is a\nGiant covert action campaign against the United states and it is organized and directed by folks that have been enemies of ours for very long time\nAnd in at the same time they could they could use these thousands of people just trying to sneak in this country has the ability of cover\nFor drug dealers or to sneak in this country a human traffickers to sneak into this country and and on and on and on I I Want to switch tracks here to talking about Obama's CIA director former CIA director John Brennan I mean\nThe guy actually admitted that he voted for a Communist Party candidate in what the mid seventies and and yet somehow ends up becoming ... director later on I mean I I'm not the communists were were were our enemies you here for the United states but apparently\nYou can support their objectives instilled rise all the way up the ranks saying but anyway ... maybe that's a different topic but\nWhen I to me this story that's this kind of disappeared from the headlines\nIs the targeting of of political opponents by the Obama administration using law enforcement and intelligence collection tools to spy on your political opponents a dish I mean people should be going to prison over something like that we I Would just assume that if if you abused your posed\nWith an intelligence agency or law enforcement agency to spy on your political opponents that that would immediately lead to prison time but at that story is just kind of disappeared from the headlines here\nYeah and I would agree absolutely with your across the board I mean this is an incredibly important thing in an incredibly damaging thing [noise] you know you you have to have a law enforcement agencies and your intelligence agencies you have to have a completely\nRigorous here instead of the law and to the constitution\nYou're not serving you know any political party in particular are serving the people over the United states and then there are lines you absolutely cannot cross a should never even contemplate crossing of Brennan as a prime example of a guy\nHow we are talking with retired CIA operative Charles Sam Faddis here on Montana talked I got a caller on the line as well let's go to Jim in billings Tim you're on what's your question or comment\nAdequate char on our country of law and order and we went back in and watch a company like Jordan thorough and find different\nRegime change in government overthrow throughout the boat that philanthropic work\nYou know to the market type organizations and and he got the other countries the guy that I I mean how can how can we sit back and get let this guy you know the kingmaker of the world and and what he that go just because he's rich I mean I\nThe guy the guy turned his own you know it don't religious people over to they're not in his own words on sixty minutes in the Nineteen nineties and an NPR interview as well you know any better yet no regret it was the happiest time of his life\nYou know how how do we get back with any sort of Congress and let this kind of do that\nAll right Tim thanks for your call yet a semi against since you might you might have had trouble hearing that caller really hear his question for you there\nSo I lost the the first few words was that about Soros\nYeah she's basically yeah George George Soros or just the influence of foreign money that that in round about ways piles and piles into our elections or in in other you know what what seemingly look like grass roots movement that oftentimes are astro turf movements\nYeah well you know one of the one of the things that I that I think this brings 'em in the question is is exposing this in other words I think the answer to the to the caller's question is what we what\nWe do in regard to the actions of this gentleman than anybody else's we expose it and people learn the facts and and there are consequences for it\nThat that takes us in the direction of how you learned those facts and you've made several references already to a a big problem we have which is we have media outlets and social media outlets that instead of just reporting the facts are trying to shape people's perception of the facts\nDeciding what you get to talk about what you get to know\nUm the curve in as a classic example right it's\nYou can literally get on the Internet and find interviews\nAlready bragging about organizing this thing and yet you could watch major news outlets all day long and not hear them breathe a word about any of this is not a secret it and it's not hard to find\nAnd yet they won't discuss it because it's not consistent with the view they want you to have so I think in order to Soros we have the same\nProblem he what he's doing is it's clear and yet it is covered up and and if you talk about it you're probably regarded as a conspiracy theorist\nYeah yeah even though you can she clearly show that documented evidence and and the other thing is the way the Russians are funded ... funneling money do environmental groups here in this country to oppose things like fracking right here in our own backyard imposed pipelines your own backyard\nOr in and it just doesn't get hardly mentioned uh in in most of the mainstream media outlets a Sam the deep state we've got a minute before we take a quick raping and I'm Wondering if you can stay on for a few more minutes I Want to get your your take on this the idea that that the deep state and we are talking about you know career hacks political hacks\nThat are they're inside of these key government agencies back in Washington DC actively undermining not just the Trump Administration they were there or the under the Bush administration trying to undermine him\nIsn't there a deep state in your perspective\nYeah without question there is a deep state then again it doesn't [noise] this is not really the rank and file and these agencies but one of the things I can tell you I I learned in my career was you know uh when you're when we were in the field doing the job everything made sense when you got back to Washington DC all of a sudden\nEverything was politics and considerations and career ...\nWho I'm hedging my my start to how I'm hearing from doing kind of hunting with him who hold that\nAll right so that was our interview with retired CIA operative Sam's status I I Want to hear more about what he has to say about the deep state but I'm gonna have to fast forward to this is our interview from later in the day yesterday let me see if you eat it up right here\nAnd he was head of the CIA counterterrorism center and the W. W. M. D. you understand the counterterrorism center from the CIA retired CIA operative Sam Faddis here on Montana's talks with us Sam thanks again for sticking on the phone\nLines here for just a few more minutes with us go we could go on for hours just just incredibly insightful um so the deep state is real now the the follow up question is is I I guess described the threat of the deep state when it really is how great of a threat it is and then how we counter it\nWell to start with you have this this conception this machine that the founders build based on three you know equal branches of government with various checks and balances and nowhere in the conception is there\nA role for a bureaucracy other than to take orders from those three branches and carry out functions and and that's how they view didn't know how it was viewed for most of our history you're in a bureaucracy you're in an agency laws are made the president gives orders you do what you're supposed to do\nNow we have a something very very different we have an unelected fourth branch of government in effect\nIn these bureaucracies\nWith folks at the top\nIn many cases who decide for themselves what they think policy should be and then no matter what the law says and no matter what the president tells them there than going to do their level best to carry out policies that they have decided upon\nSo on accountable to anybody uncontrolled by anyone\nVast it is not a handful of people as it was for most of our history it's millions of people with huge sums of money and influence so that means to start with he's lost control\nOf a big chunk of your government and then when you add to that the facts as they begin to not just decide for themselves what those policies are but to ally themselves with particular political interests as we have seen with the Trump situation\nAnd and this could be anywhere from national security leaders trying to undermine the president or trying to steer policy the way they want to do with your all the way down to maybe a\nYou know land managers of land management agencies back here in Montana that say well I don't like logging so I'm going to leak disinformation the Sierra Club to help their last leader where I'm going to undermine ah this this new project that the administration is trying to do in the end and nobody elected these people [noise]\nYeah and and really what I always say to the folks and we're talking about this is wherever you are in the political spectrum I don't care what you know you're a Democrat or Republican during the Green Party or libertarian this should terrify you yeah because\nYou know it could be if they could skew one way today in ten years\nAnd the Afghanistan All right there we go so that was our interview I think what I'll do you know I'm going to a post that entire audience and if somebody you're probably driving to work maybe just hopped in the car you're about to\nTake kids to school and you're like wow this guy is fascinating the says Sam Faddis\nA former CIA operative I uh to later today I Will post this entire audio of our interview with Sam Faddis on our website news talk not five five dot com so that you can go back and listen to it for more especially the stuff that you had to say\nAbout the migrant caravan coming up through Mexico says it ties back directly back to Marxist movements inside\nOf Honduras any any specifically name names and parties so you'll want to tune in for that entire thing our phone lines are open for you anything and everything you want to talk about here on the show let's jump right into the phone caller or here we get Steve on the line\nFrom Valentine Steve how're you doing what's on your mind this morning\nOkay it's the with our constitution and and especially like the second amendment very\nSpoiled and you go to Michael in prison he lied under oh okay [noise]\nNo I don't know exactly how it goes about when some new a representative or senator wins office I think I'm not a hundred percent that they have to swear with your hand on the Bible to swear to uphold our constitution so by saying that\nIs you're there at the whole uphold the constitution and how can a democratic person\nOr say that they're going to basically want to abolish the second amendment they've taken an oath to uphold our constitution and then they want a man so why aren't they in Britain and thrown in jail that's my question\nTo answer that syndrome really interesting question that you oppose there but hey look at the end of the day we we've got the ability to throw him out this Tuesday to throw out Jon Tester who\nHas a who is not upholding the constitution the United states he's voting against our Second Amendment rights are and on and on and on um so yeah that but that's a good question about hey that he's obviously violating his own because he's attacking the constitution of the United states but other\nThan the jail they're going to do it beforehand [laughter] and loss on it just it just makes you mad it really does yeah that that's for sure they can't play by the same rules\nTen minutes and in death interviews

done that campaigns across the state statewide a he's also helped guest host the show for us when I've been gone to the past ... good to see if hey thanks for having me or encourage be here as always yeah\nSo um so you put together some numbers you you are or share some of this information with me late late yesterday [noise]\nUm well in and I just thought wow this is incredible um hey I don't want to just talk about this why don't you come in share this newsletter so what what was it the stats that you're compiling that the Montana travelers are basically infusing twenty thousand dollars into one judicial race here in Yellowstone county\nYeah that's right um the trailers association through through one of their political action committees has now spent uh just over twenty thousand dollars on Julie peers here in Yellowstone county\nUh what's really interesting is most people know I mean the trial lawyers are extremely liberal group in typically they get involved in Supreme Court race it's\nState wide wide and realize that a guy like that um to to my knowledge and as you know I've been around my town politics for a long long time now and I've never seen them to get involved\nIn a district court race before\nAnd it looks like just looking through these reports what happened was um [noise] you know we've got to a\nThis race and you know some kind of a very interesting you know very much shaping up as a lot of judicial races are nowadays um to have you know a very defiant conservative and actually ... in a very defined liberal in Julie peers and and Democrats and liberal groups don't like this\nBecause well Democrats have struggled a statewide and legislative races to when they've done very well and judicial races\nBecause they are able to hide behind that nonpartisan later they don't have the deed behind their name even if that's the philosophy that God's right and and so now this all started um actually put out a piece you know that simply said there's a lot of differences between her and Julie Parrish at one of them was that\nShe's only donated to conservative candidates and causes and\nCharlie Pierce is only donated to liberal\nIt was to begin the trigger for all of this trial lawyer activity to get involved\nUm in this race and to give you an idea that twenty thousand dollars when we talk about you know the millions and millions of dollars that have been spent in the U.S Senate race in statewide races you know twenty thousand dollars can kind of sound like it's not very much money but when we put that in context of\nThe judicial race uh that's basically about as much money as these two candidates have individually raised and spent\n... so the trailers are effectively trying to buy this race entirely yes which is interesting to me because I you know I've interviewed both ... and Julie Pearson both have have good backgrounds good resumes both are very nice\nIce women both both accomplished women um but but that's always the challenge and these judicial races for voters out there as well what's the difference between these judicial candidates and the only time the only thing we can really look at his campaign finance to try to get a sense of where they stand but in that race in particular I Know\nThat there is kind of a philosophical difference between the two because\nBecause uh uh Julie Parrish joined us here on the show and she said that she believes the constitution as a living breathing document and then ... her out when she's on the so she said absolutely not it is not a living breathing document we we have to rule in the constitution as is we can't just make it up as we go basically so\nSo this is a there is a clear philosophical difference between the two candidates here right in\nYou know we we've had some of these conversations before where you know a Julia Pierson said things like um judges activist judges the legislature from the bench are brave\nAnd uh actually her out of his said you know I I won't legislate from the ... the judge's job is to interpret the laws as written not you know make them into what they wish they were\nUm and so I I think that's really why the trial lawyers who have really taken a an interest in this race is\nThey're afraid to have conservatives on the bench at any level I mean it was just a few weeks ago a back in Washington DC that we saw the links that liberals are willing to go to to block conservatives from the United States Supreme court\nI'm pretty extreme situation with the Kavanaugh hearings ... and all that kinda stuff but I think it's just important reminder for folks that that same thing happens on the local level or you know to the tune of twenty thousand dollars this one is particularly interesting\nBecause you've got you know well known Democrat activists and attorney gene Jerusalem the um the kicked in five thousand dollars to pay\nFor this uh this effort so I mean you know essentially funding a quarter of it um himself so that that's kind of interest in\nIt isn't a stranger is a guy supposed to be Mr campaign finance watchdog I mean they got it's like hey and he's actually had commissioner political practices are complaints against him as well but\nBut it gets propped up in the media some as some sort of a watchdog and campaign finance when he's one of the big players on the other side playing the dirty politics right absolutely I mean you know the guy he he he donated his time very gracious of him [laughter]\n... after his political didn't go after it's all it's a nice of you to donate your direct meanwhile\nUh he and his wife are running their own political action committee um of which they they were ultimately find his wife was fine by the commissioner of political practices for violating campaign finance rules all while he's out prosecuting cases on behalf of the commissioner of political practice\nYeah it's it's just unbelievable a crazy crazy how this is so what do you think the travelers why why are they still heavily invested in a yellow stone county judicial race well like\nI thought I'd benefit that I I think it for them it's it's just a sign of the times they you know they're just laying down the marker we're not going to let considers be elected at any level\nInvolved in a district court race on behalf of Julie parents I mean this extremely liberal group\nWho you know in terms of partisan contributions you know they've donated thousands of dollars to the Montana Democratic Party and to their legislative campaign effort in fact the eggs to to fund to execute this expenditure they actually use the same political consulting firm that's used by the Montana Democratic Party could conduct\nIndependent expenditures in their legislative race well I mean that's how closely tied these groups it goes back to to I think\nOne of the biggest problems we have in this country right right now which is it doesn't matter what the law is doesn't matter what laws Congress passes\nIt doesn't matter what happens at the ballot box\nThe these folks on the left will stop at ... at nothing to stop what they disagree with they will resist at every level and so because they're losing at the ballot box because they're losing\nA you know uh when it comes to the law instead they just figured well if we just control the judges then then we can just throw out whatever we don't like you know like for example the the ... the Green Party gets thrown off the ballot by liberal judge in Helena\nAre backed by lawyer you know what I mean on and on and on here we go I'm ... and then it goes to a liberal a trial lawyer money dominated Montana Supreme Court\nUm and so and same thing with our logging our federal courts that we've got judges that were put on the bench by Obama and by Democrats senators here in Montana and then they rule against coal mining in eastern Montana oil and gas development in eastern Montana and then timber in western Montana\nAnd and it's because they don't care what the law is they don't and because they're losing at the ballot box they're doing everything they can to stuff they're friendly judges in there to to throw out whatever they don't\nLike yeah I mean you're absolutely right I mean we're seeing it at every level I mean the Green Party cases a great example I mean this is how egregious it was the the judge said on that case in Helena\nUm who is also supported you know by a lot of these same trial lawyers that are ... contribution this effort in um\n... received campaign contributions from one of the plaintiffs in that case not one of the lawyers involved which is you know shady enough but actually one of the plaintiffs done judge was a campaign contributed to him and he still said on the calf ... like\nKind of makes you wonder if

Williams is that who you're back in the race\nWell I'm not backing anybody but I'm definitely not I guess you'd say I'd be back in there because I Can't believe that the universe is seven thousand years old you know\nHe doesn't believe that but uh but but so you're against them because of his Christian beliefs on creation\nChristian beliefs as intellectual relief\nHuh okay but what about the topic a gun control does it bother you Kathleen Williams has an ad from the n._r._a.\nOr I don't know that doesn't bother me because I think she could defend the at our raise you know I don't believe that either you know [noise] but uh I don't think she's a gives gun\nShe claims to support the second amendment that's why I like the air on your show I like I Know that question would be the first one to come up with you you should be asking her these thank\nI have yeah I I\nThat's why I like the air on your show I like I Know that question will be the first one that come up you you should be asking her these thank\nGod I have yeah I I I've asked her about it before yeah yeah what did I say\nI get off the pull up the old audio clip I mean look at them and I keep in mind that was much earlier on in the campaign to\nWait wait a long time ago\nYeah I mean back because back then she was like hey I if I got an F from the n._r._a. I Would take it as a badge of pride I Would be proud of it and then then it got the F from the n._r._a. and then and then in these debates she was saying oh no no no no no no I I support gun rights so that was almost like she was backtracking on that I don't\nBy to complete pairs of single vision glasses purchased forty nine dollars or two pairs of progress as for only eighty nine dollars\nThey can work where here to help you some exceptions by the door for detailed offered by November ten\nSettled yeah well I bought a drove around and I wouldn't keep it in production I wouldn't have Kelvin C. I I Love the fact that Matt Rosendale kept that ranch in production that that he kept cows on that ranch\nBecause it and here's what ... because you know here's here's the problem when somebody from out of state comes and buys ranch in Montana and they just want it for ...\nThey just want to have their own little hunting playground eh get where they're coming from there but here's the deal when they pull the cows off there you're pulling that piece of the economy\nIn ... you're buying fertilizer you're buying feet you're buying supplements\nOr your your by ear to your Brian all this stuff to support that piece of the economy so you're going to main street to buy those products and so so when you keep that land and production you're supporting ... if you're just keeping the land out there just because you want to have the nice hunting spot I'm a pool that land out of the economy in ... frankly\nHeck he keeps them cows on the place you're going to have better wildlife habitat anyway right we all know that it's going to be a better better managed a better raising all all in all around on that that's why some hunters complain all almost all the good old or hang out on the private land well what do you mean the private land ... and everything like that while I Wonder why\nMe anyway so I just wanted to slightly disagree with that previous point that's why the American prairie\nReserve in northeastern Montana is such a threat\nTo this to the state because you pull the cows off the land\nAnd and and you just want to make it your little reserve you you pull that piece of the economy up and in these communities which are such a the lifeblood of the state would would dry up\nYou know we wouldn't have the the friday night lights and the big you know small town football games if it wasn't for these farmers and ranchers that are out there All right let's that jumped back into the phone lines here I'm In fact let's go to start with Joe in Missoula because I think Joe tried to get on yesterday and we just ran out of time\nSo let's go to Joe listening to a a nine thirty Kate M.

TV reports affected took John King from our sister radio station in Missoula point this out\nIt wasn't that they didn't mention the anti Trump connection at all but the apparently the reason these two\nAre old boys I did this to the bus driver into the bus was because they thought that the bus was transporting Trump supporters to and from the rally and it turns out it was now just a un bust just transporting college kids but they started throwing everything on a British is funny it's like oh so nobody in the media thought it was worthwhile report that it was an anti Trump\nA little mini riot that these kids were staging\nGo a free right to speak to you don't agree with you know because that's how I Am and and you can just sit on [noise]\nYeah yeah well it's a really appreciate your phone call a Joe thanks for calling back in the day 'cause I Know we wanted to get to yesterday and just ran a straight out of time uh when he was talking about dog whistles and it reminded me\nUm you know anti Semitism or I remember this was was this back in the spring some you've been to an end of the show for a while you remember the so so back when this race first kind of kicked off I think it was after the primary election\nUm Politico did it did an interview with with Jon Tester\nAnd and they were asking about you know Matt Rosendale who's going to be his Republican opponent the U.S Senate race\nIn and test are basically you know ... said all of those Rosenberg guy ... noses Rosenberg guy\nI saw that it was like oh man I was like man if he was a Republican they would be calling him an anti Semite right now they would demand that he resigns from the United States Senate for being anti Semitic anti Jewish um that that's that was my reaction when I saw it but I wasn't I Am ... let me be very clear I Am not saying\nThat senator tester is anti Jewish or anti Semitic that's not what I'm saying here\nI'm just saying that if a Republican and said what he had said\nThat's what they would be called well then an NBC News reporter I'm not talking about some kid in Missoula some kid straight out of college and in billings or Bozeman or an NBC News reporter back in New York City who apparently was Jewish saw the same quote I did\nAnd he says while that's less dog whistle and more air horn so he said that wasn't even just a dog whistle of anti Semitism it was an air or her you know\nAnd didn't make the news back here in Montana of course it didn't of course it did but if Rosenberg I mean Rosendale had said something like that old buddy we'd still be hearing about it right now when we got back into the phone lines we got a let's see next up a Rick in Steven's ville a Rick good to hear from you\nAre you there Rick\nOkay and sound like here on trudging round in the background there probably filling up on coffee alright well standby we'll get back to you if we can uh let's see who do we got we got run and big for Ron are you there\nOf the alright well standby we'll get back to you if we can uh let's see who we got we got run and big for Ron are you there\nYou're saying hey good to hear from me just\nTwo things um I don't know if anyone was cold and about this yet but I get the sleazy mailer from those organization called the center for voter information from Elena\n'em and they claimed to be a non partisan organization uh so I wasn't that some checking and every every cent they spent has been for Democrats and it's they just\nThe three bullet points for Kathleen Williams one of those um coverage for preexisting conditions GM Ford they know Williams years medicate guts or GM Ford is William Snow with and they go millionaire tax cuts I mean it is so\nBlatantly or\nA partisan it's ridiculous and this is this letter signed by his character but I mean but Lionel drips over that's an appropriate name drips\nOr if you Google them and the ... you can take a look at the guy you know he's not conservative but it just another deceptive a flyer that went out and the second thing I wanted to bring up or maybe I'm missing something in the news but with this booming economy and the Democrats", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "31"}
