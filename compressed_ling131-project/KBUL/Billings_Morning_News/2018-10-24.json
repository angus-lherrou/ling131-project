Montana State University the doctor or a doctor or a demon Parker from the political science department um yet David again thanks for us here in the poll results in poll numbers with us there's really just kind of an absence of public polling so\nYou just kinda gotta gotta take whenever you can get and then uh I I guess to a certain extent you got to take a lot of them with a grain of salt or where do where do we find the credible phones versus maybe the not so incredible bulls [noise]\nI think that most important thing I factor when you're living here for useless\nAnd I think the first thing I say is you know we all go to the doctor's office you get a blood drawn sample of your foot in the if you eat right before you have a sample drawn broader so your folks are for the first thing you have to follow certain\nRules to make sure your full season in line man you what the population is sometimes remember you know that with numbers that we have in terms of population for for the fences at the end of the day sometimes you've got to make some educated guesses about what turned out for the first\nThing is for for you want to make sure that fact it out very carefully fighting\nHere is that we made which I did a pretty good job of viewing our on our full putting out for our website\nYeah what what are the questions that that I Know has been out there and okay so a lot of the fall's kind of got twenty sixteen wrong and you didn't do a full back then but a lot of the national phone in particular kind of kind of got a semi everybody thought Hillary\nYou know people are crying on MSNBC uh you know at midnight or in a while and then don't jump when the ... the\n... how do you think what what did the pollsters learn from twenty sixteen ... good good they are being under representation of Republican voters likely heading into the twenty Eighteen elections also my simple numbers actually be better for these Republican candidates [noise]\nSo\nOne of the things that important for the actors she'll have to leave winning probably about ... it was right next to the people that were more problematic there were fewer of them\nThey didn't pull it off and something happened something happened that was different and when something happens that all written one direction in this case lower educated voters ... college degrees who have voted for Barack Obama have voted for Democrats to certain margins moves trumpet of hard to capture that there's also\nThere is some truth to some voters are hard to get a hold of some people don't want to ask for older don't want to take a survey which tried to do is in your weight your sample\nTo use them for Kisco procedures to try to bring your sample in line with the folks that you believe or Mr again it is a little tricky and it takes some experience I'm\nA couple of things you know for example we actually adjusted ... twenty six teams margin for president here and say\nActually I Would say article is pretty optimistic for Republicans here but the last democratic searches democratic surge then it will be\nInteresting yeah Robert figured better situation\nFor the Republican we'll be all\nAnd that's the question right now you're going to be a blue label or a red wave I guess we'll we'll find out I did get some numbers out of the Yellowstone county elections office or they have already gotten about twenty eight thousand\nBallots returned already I'm Brett rather burns expecting he's if he if he had to make an early gas right now he would guess about sixty sixty two thousand balance them at work now was a Democrat I'm number line of a memory years of a pardon me if I'm if I'm saying there\nWas a Democrat turnout lower this primary election I Know it's tough because we don't register by party but\n... but when you look at the at the Indiana based off the primary elections is that any indicator heading into November here in Montana\n[noise] while democratic voters are they're all\nRepublicans I'm for I remember that very clearly but I remember um oh I got I got to remember but I Know I Know nationally the special election in case for every member\nI Know here in the Democrats are we so every Democratic primary primary vote totals sick or not very necessarily dictate is what's going to happen in this all sorts of caution and try to make\nSure yeah yeah I'm All right ed maybe just the another question for you here before we got runs the other nice break but David Parker ... university appreciate you joining us here in the poll results and maybe tomorrow could we could we have yet to Seventy maybe talking ballot initiatives would weaken jet off about that but uh [noise]\nUm because I we got Dr ... seven thirty five tomorrow but ah [noise]\nUm so we we can I think we already

number rock Obama we're going head\nTo head for the Democratic nomination for the presidency and\nCame down to the wire a so much soda where we're Montana's primary actually mattered a you know

uh here in Montana in June of that year uh you know the race would have basically been over but so they did this cock his election or they did they did this presidential caucus in Montana\nAnd it was a trial run in like January February of that year in in two thousand eight I Believe anyway and so so what ended up happening as we did we had all these presidential candidates come to town it's kind of exciting so so we had a you know we had like a you know Mitt Romney was coming to Montana or John McCain was coming to Montana\nMitt Romney's kid was it still is cafe tried to whip up the vote but

Jones stopped by a few days ago in Studio with some brisket and so we got the does great the Dickey barbecue brisket and you're like hey what's up\nWhat's up with me well go down the rent Rand Paul a Sunday Morning and then you get you some some barbecue uh Dickey says well so it'll be the downtown billings location not the Laura location just to be clear All right let's go to the phones real quick and then we've got the bill Mercer standing by in Studio we got\nHim in billings on the phone lines Tim ... thanks for standing by you know we just had a real quick few minutes there with Rand Paul but what's your thoughts\nAre I think that a senator or to make a push to President Trump to have his father replace Nikki Haley as the UN ambassador\n... I'd love to see that but I had two quick points\nI wanted to make 'em you know with with the nuclear nuclear arms treaty you know everybody's up in arms because Trump because he's going to leave it I feel like I'm living in the movie Groundhog Day Trump said he's going to do something it's going to be the end of the world\n[laughter] we're going to see that we're going\nTo come back with a better treatment and we've got now you know and that's where I think it's going to happen that's just my prediction is just every time he does something that everybody is going to be the end of the world come back a month later it's already better than it was before\nAnd then the other thing that I was hoping to bring up with ... I find it very ironic that you know er here two weeks ago he ... they were being you know kind of kind of a chastised by the media for asking people to tone down the violent\nRhetoric and I'm now since since a\nPresident or former President Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and George ... you know explosives packages oh my gosh it's going to be the end of the world the media is going to take us and run with it and all conservatives are going to be evil and it's just\nYou know people have been asking for everybody to tone it down for a long time now and and uh you know they were being chastised for it and I don't condone any of it\nYeah you know we went in there they're going to take this and they're going to run with it and all conservatives\nYou know we're going to be evil because you know some whack job you know tried to pull Unabomber and it's just it's ridiculous and I ... it's just it's it's accuracy of the of the liberal media\nAnd I just well yeah there is a good point yeah you don't want it to the end up that's a good point they were saying hey everybody needs to tone it down here you know\nBlah blah blah and that's that was what the Republicans are saying\nUm the other thing I thought it was interesting was it wasn't like the day before that whole a bomb was found the George Soros his house that wasn't there a news story about I I Swear I saw

line at four O. six to nine four zero nine Seventy to Montana talks on TV well am nine Seventy and news talk Ninety five point why\nAre we got more phone call or is on the line as well standby cars and just a few minutes we'll jump right back into the phone lines here in our room rock cabinet company fault lines of course this hour Montana talks has brought to you by ... cabinet company you're flooring and cabinet tree expert so we'll get on the phone calls in just a few minutes before a bill Mercer has to head back to work and get back to\nTo the day job when he's not campaigning for the legislature it for his night job of the bill is probably just like being back in law school or isn't it yeah [laughter]\nYeah former U.S attorney Bill Maher sir I'm speaking at the uh the twenty ninth annual McGuire memorial conference on family violence put together by the ... family violence task force that we are talking about elder abuse and all these scams that they'll use\nReally the target anybody but seniors are particularly vulnerable you know here in billings we've got all these great senior living a a a residence is here you know all across town so many so many great ones\nAnd so I Know a lot of people that hey there from off point or Sydney or\nForesight but they come to billings to be close to the hospitals in the living some of these great senior living places so there's a the hype a population of senior citizens here in billings but really sit across Montana I mean we're just an aging population in particular so so Montana's kind of especially vulnerable to this army yeah that's uh\nOften than not there's no real way to claw that money back and of course this is a population that doesn't have\nThe ability to go out and make more money they've all retired uh and so it's a real challenge to to really reestablish what you had if you've become a victim and if there is no law enforcement response and the other thing that is important to remember is this is the population who often times\nHas a house paid off doesn't have credit card debt they from a wealthy standpoint there's a greater concentration of wealth in this population than there is for other cohorts of our population and so that's another reason why they're attractive or as targets so they're all kinds of reasons that and they need\nMore trusting of people it's Montana we all agree on most of us grew up where you didn't have your doors locked in lock your car you could leave\nYour wallet in the car and it'd be fine in those days are unfortunately passed but uh we were talking during the break you said ... and and I know you are involved and in some counter terror work under the Bush administration as well but he said it's kind of like like the old phrase tagline you'd use for terrorism see something say something\nElder abuse can be the same thing or what are you looking for and then who do you say something to\nYou know it's um [noise] ... you say something to the adult protective services office which is a part of the state department of public health and Human Services and they have an operation and buildings but for your listeners all over the state every county has an adult protective services group\nAnd so part of our message has been and tomorrow we'll be look you could be someone who's a taxi cab driver\nYou could be someone who works\nFor a public utility it it it is amazing how many different people have\nEyes on problems where they see something or here's something and they say you know that just doesn't seem right to me that's when we hope that they will reach out to adult protective services and say you know this is what I Am aware of and I just want to report it because it seems to me that something\nMay be happening that's not appropriate with respect to that senior citizen\nHas there been some high profile cases that you've seen here in Montana just ah throughout your years in the legal field\nYou know we started pressing this because we saw it as an emerging problem when I was us attorney and you can the cases can be do this\nTax fraud cases where all of a sudden someone is diverted money and then not reported it you can do it as an identity theft case and so unfortunately these cases are are presented to law enforcement for investigation by adult protective services\nOr others at a fairly high rate law enforcement then needs to investigate those cases and yeah there are unfortunately there have been significant convictions or and one of the things that that we were really worried about in this area is you need to get enough of a sentence where\nSomebody who reads the stories as men they're taking that seriously that the person who is going to be in prison as a result of defrauding that senior citizen and it seems like there's going to be a really robust response I'm I'm not going to play games in that area and that's so that's all part of the deterrent message or\nWell bill I Know you've got to get back to the office for your day job here but a real quickly if you get elected to the legislature here in the next couple of weeks what's what's going to be the the three or four things that you're going to focus in on in the state legislature\nOne of the things that I've been talking to folks about is I'd like to see a ...\nI think a more strategic vision between the Montana higher education system and school boards around the state in terms of what I'm going to call out comes a you know our alma mater the University of Montana is struggles recently with recruits\nPolitical outcomes a you know our alma mater University of Montana is\nStruggles recently with recruitment but one of the things that's been identified by our new president is we really have trouble retaining students as well um so once we get them there we've got to make sure that we can keep them there and that goes back to our the college ready when they get their diploma from high school and\nUh I'd like to see more of an emphasis on what are we going to do to make sure their college ready including more through the Montana digital academy more through dual credit opportunities\nAnd really I'm On a district by district basis make sure that as people get that diploma whether it's a two year program or for your program they're ready to go\nAnd it means something to yeah there's something there's some meat on those bones there also\nAnd their and their outcomes out of certain high schools that would suggest that many of their graduates aren't ready and I think we've got to we've got to really focus on that but I'm I'm worried about making sure that the public safety I think there was some bad public safety legislation\nAnd the last session I'm going to work or ... that we've we've been hearing about that [laughter] his back out on the streets\nThat will be no problem with that right and I think we might have a problem\nAll right bill Mercer good luck to you safe travels on the campaign trail you and all the candidates out there and a and a ... thanks for I'm helping out with this conference over the next couple of days is well her highlighting this important issue\n... thinks there are good to see you as well into yeah we'll stay in touch with with Bill is the legislative session moves ahead to cause as you know it's a fast moving river on for months and then they're done or so they got a short window of time to get stuff done\nHeartless jump into the phone lines here for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy anything and everything you want to talk

if I didn't say it shame on me because it's what I was thinking uh last friday when we were doing the show live from uh from Missoula the day after the Trump rally I mean what did they say eight thousand people showed up there I I don't know how many people showed up all I Know is that line went on\nForever I mean the the line was like riding off into the sunset is if it's stretched all the way down to Stevens fill up from the ... airport you couldn't even see the end of the lie that you just saw a little dust trail off in the distance pointing towards blue mountains south of town\nOr that but that so many people showed up for this thing and it wasn't just folks that came in from the Flathead it wasn't just folks that drove up from the bitter route and elsewhere I mean it's a fringe view there\nA veterans from Butte and elsewhere that we're at the Trump rally last week in ... there were a lot of Missoula people there and at least the thought that was going through my mind is wow what kind of an impact is this going to have on the city of Missoula because you remember\nA you remember we we we got the town and yeah they spelled out impeach on the M. and they spelled out liar on the L\nThat you couldn't even see it from the airport I mean when President Trump landed in air force one it you'd need a spotting scopes to even see the little antics on the hillsides it looked like an Oxford comma from the Missoula airport but I had to go find I had to drive all over town to go find the protests\nWe're not going to tolerate this nonsense more we're standing up\nAnyway I'll tell you about that we've got audio thanks to our our sister station KGB oh in Missoula tell you about that a little bit later\nThis morning but first up we've got an exclusive

especially with the libertarian boulders or libertarian conservatives there's always going to break\nAnd voters or libertarian conservatives there was always going to bring both from a president Ronald Reagan easy didn't wouldn't be the one who had to close it said that the libertarians are the heart of of something to that effect but anyway uh Rand Paul was asked him I said what so what are the are\nThe major accomplishment would you say when it comes to liberty\nSo far now with with the Trump Administration back in Washington DC here you go senator ramble\nFor one thing that makes a big difference in probably the biggest a policy thing that Republicans have done to cut taxes tester opposed the cutting into actors right now our economy is growing like it hasn't grown in any time\nIn my lifetime result lowest unemployment in my lifetime we are doing great Kentucky I can feel it in the sense that I'm sure it's the same in my town of the economy\nIs just going gangbusters because we cut taxes\nAnd that means that the Republicans believe that when you go out and you work hard that that money is yours and you should get to keep as much of it as possible when that money stays in Montana\nIt's first and creates jobs tester wants to save your money to Washington and they want to increase taxes decrease taxes that people everybody in Montana needs to know that Chester voted to keep your taxes high Rosendale would vote to cut your taxes and that's how the economy grows it really\nHits the liberty argue that age your money you earned it you should give up as little as possible to a distant federal government and the federal government should be taking care of our national defence our judiciary our legislative branch and little else\nYeah I agree with you there in into some of my more liberal friends or my maybe younger friends who say well keep the government out of my cell phone it's like well don't you want that same government he keeps there that you know the bottom of your back pocket a little bit more to [noise]\nAnd that is sort of the consistency of of libertarians that conservatives like myself who say we want to be left alone I'm part of the leave me alone coalition and then once you\nNot in my house not in my cell phone and not in my pocket and I want to be largely left alone as long as I don't do physical violence to someone else and that is the ... trial caught libertarian but you can also call constitutional conservatism you can call it what our founding fathers intended\nAnd like I say I'm not campaigning around the country are very few people I think Matt Rosendale will be an ally to people like Mike Lee and myself\nBelieve strongly in the constitution and vote against all this crap and are often it's likely and sometimes it's two or three others but uh I think Matt Rosendale leader with us as a strength of character and this is a judgment call I've met\nHim many times for I think Matt Rosendale has the courage to say not only to stand up to big spenders to the Democrat side but also to stand up to a big centers on the Republican side\nAll right well Senator Rand Paul I know I first got a chance to meet you in billings Montana back in two thousand eight when you're campaigning for Ron Paul your your father and so I Know you're going to get um Harry ... warm welcome here ten years later she's coming back to the states\nI think campaign and these critical US Senate race to Senator Rand Paul a pleasure to have you on Montana talk just want to thank so much for being with us look forward to seeing this weekend thank you\nAll right that was Senator Rand Paul a yet in by the way you several stops across the state of Montana is so I tell you what if you go to Montana talks dot com\nOr there's a couple of different stories that I posted there a one in earlier one earlier this week the details the Donald Trump junior ... visits\nThat some of those which include a Rand Paul in western Montana you can find those details there or check your local radio station they they've got the ... and then he just added some new visits in billings Lewis turning Kalispell first Sunday so you can also find those details\nLike I said check your local radio station and by the way let me just say you're too We're getting a lot of these big gas on the show the schools have interview there with Rand Paul you might remember when Donald Trump junior now a lot of folks have have talked with Donald Trump junior\nBut back in June a we were the exclusive of first interview to sit down with Donald Trump junior and also with Kimberly ... such great to have these big S. joined us on the show\nLet me just say that if there are some big guess on the Democratic side of the aisle we'd love to have you on the show as well here too I mean is is you know I've I've had ... you know prominent Democrats joined us here on Montana talks in fact when former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson who was at one point a presidential contender himself\nWho was Bill Clinton's energy secretary who was Bill Clinton's\nUN ambassador who is also a Democrat Senator for next when he came to Montana\nI don't think anybody else even talk to them but he joined us right here on on Montana talks and so um but the thing is there's there's just really no big name\nDemocrats coming to town I'm not even trying to take credit for the Trump economy right now you know ... President Obama was down in Nevada trying to take credit for the economy\nBut apparently doesn't want to come to Montana to try to take credit for the uh the traffic on me I guess All right let's go right into the phone lines and everybody's been patiently waiting here lots of bugs we even got some folks who were on with us yesterday but we just simply ran out of time so I Want to get to you for sure today first step we got him in jolly yet\nKim Ari they're going to hear and I'm doing great thanks for your call\nThanks for having me wondering Jon Tester he's got a lot of friends and they're not showing up to talk about him or talk about how great he is [noise] I'm not even the fourth or governor showing\nWhat's up with that\n[noise] that's a really good question I mean you would think if if he's such a popular governor like his buddies on Twitter from his office claimed that he is why is out there helping his buddies in Montana [noise]\nAnd it goes to show that I think that a Republican and Donald Trump even Rand Paul which I thought it was great to hear him on your radio show they're coming forward and talking about Matt Rosendale fortunately there's a lot of enthusiasm on our side [noise]\n... we we did get some breaking news from the wall Street Journal just came into my ah inbox on my phone that'd be my inbox I guess I just came in on my phone right now just boom shows a breaking news here we go\n[noise] crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mon NBS as he's known said Jamal ... killing was a quote crime painful to all Saudis calling it quote unjustifiable so there you go the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman calling it a crime painful to all Saudis calling it an justifiable here's my question\nOkay I get it this is this is a big story right in and folks are going to be held accountable by the Trump Administration as though the facts come out and as the details come out here I get it\nSo when will the establishment and the western media now start caring as much for the women in Iran\nAs they care about this show good guy that's all I'm saying here are just the the double standards and the hypocrisy from from the establishment media just drives me nuts they will do the bidding from a propaganda standpoint for the Iranians\nAnd failed to hold them accountable if anything play right into their their play book\nBut but but one guy or you know and it shouldn't happen in and there'll be held accountable for this and everything like that but really one guy compared all the women in Iran at justice is unbelievable\nUh uh some of these stories that are out here All right so ah yeah so Rand Paul a he'll be in billings however in and Lewis town a those are taking place on Sunday billings it'll be a decrease barbecue average at the duck in of course Lewis town\nAt the old Elks lodge a those visits taking place Sunday\nOr a more details can be found at Montana talks dot com a real quickly before we jump back on the phone calls here so I started off the show by talking about how I you know I I just wonder if change is a foot\nIn Missoula now\nAs a result of the Trump rally huge Trump rally last week that took place in in Missoula thousands of people that were there and a lot of ... a lot of people were glued to their TVs and radios listening and watching the Trump rally it was the talk all around town and I just wonder all those people who've been bullied\nBy the loud left in Missoula for all these years they just keep their heads down and they go to work and they put food on the tables for their families and they don't speak up and I wonder if they're going to start standing up there and start speaking up\nAnd then I saw this story from our friends that are sister station cage if you own a zoo or John King at the story here\nA a a church in Missoula cross point church in Missoula they now say that they're receiving\nNumerous profanity laced phone calls get riding the church because they have political campaigns posted outside on the church grounds\nBasically the church in doors to the pro life candidate Matt Rosendale Greg gene four day a couple of local candidates Brad cheetah and Adam hurts and so all these people are calling the costs out the church because they dare\nPost their political message out there are in support and they said look we're not we're not\nThere are in support and they said look we're not we're not Democrat Republican\nWere supporting the pro life candidates and so if there's democratic candidates that are real love will put their signs out there too and your breath vanity lays phone calls from the loud left in Missoula over that in and to give you another perspective or somebody you across the statement of heard about this but\nIn billings for example a there's a taxpayer funded organization called the big sky ETA and they do they do some great work I Am not under cutting the work that they do but they're a taxpayer funded entity\nAnd they endorsed measures that are on our ballot for this November that will hide your taxes all across the state no why would a pro business group endorsed tax hikes and now they might have the reasons but here's the deal oh so it's okay for some taxpayer funded entity that's getting our money\nBy force their forcefully taking our money through the government and giving it to an entity and then they can endorse\n... tax hikes for us to pay more taxes all but if a church decides that they want to speak out\nIn support of pro life candidate that's unconscionable and they're going to get ... that's the hypocrisy that I'm Talking about here you're like why didn't hear about that taxpayer funded entity a you know making endorsements in it yeah that's because it didn't become a big news story\nOr that's the again a poverty measure made it that's why we have shows like this this is the this is the the slice of your day where you get a chance to hear the other side you get a chance to hear another point of view and we don't cover at one of the callers well let's go right to the phone calls here we are I think is Corey in Livingston still standing\nBy poor area there yes I Am All right well good to hear from you what's on your mind\nYeah thanks um I like to talk about that a strike and he's been airing on TV with a veteran that real quick at a little tongue in cheek side by so you were at the time rally\nSo do you think there are more people at the track and field and aggravation [laughter]\nYou know I don't know what the numbers were um [laughter] but even at even at anyway close even if it was close I mean the Obama inauguration I mean you've got a major city right there uh that leans left that could easily fill up then the inauguration whereas you know I Know that\nAnybody would say tester ads as with the veterans fainting him for all the stuff he does and yet so many things that he scans for\nLike practically destroyed the sovereignty of our nation site and they just sat there and for her ... allowing people to come and terrorists and people ...\nThe sanctuary cities they sound nice and yet they're harboring\nUnlawful alien I like to say unlawful because it's illegal and legal clueless separate ... [noise] you know [noise] I thought for a Democrat would be a vote for\nSanctuary cities which will destroy our nation\nOpen borders um more meddling in our health care at the VA isn't so much trouble because it's government for and why so many people think Obamacare is a good thing with having more government meddling in our health care set of having private\nCompanies do it with competition\nA vote for a Democrat means I vote for more modern and more killing a unborn abortion stop beating heart it's not a mass of cells it's a safety [noise]\nI'm just so many things you know it's a veteran fought for that have surfaced again and it it amazes me that [noise]\nUm things that he would stand for and vote for\nWell and that's a that's a good question and that's a good point and and also keep in mind on that front that you know basically test her hand picks three or four veterans throws them on a campaign commercial and wants you to think that that's representing all veterans I've heard from a lot of veterans who who feel the\nWho are uh their frankly\nUm they they are offended by the the campaign commercial but tester put out because\nIt gives us a parents like all these poor veterans are so desperately in need of some politicians assistance for one foot and and I think the bigger picture is that Jon Tester has not health veterans\nHe has fought much needed reforms all and then at the last minute deal hill attaches named to try to take credit for but he has fought more opportunities for veterans to get health care from their local doctors in their local hospitals\nHe he's defended the VA bureaucracy at the height of the V. A. scandal because it was Obama's guy so he had the ... but what unfortunately\nWe can't get kind of these veterans that are satisfied with after that no we can't get them on a commercial for\nThey're they're out there they're they're out\nThere in fact Navy SEAL bull rich and back who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan\nIs on a five minute long video I played some of the audio before but if he was endorsing Jon Tester\nThe liberal lean newspapers in Montana would be blanketing the state with a news story about it but because he's not endorsing Jon Tester because he said Jon Tester has failed veterans they ignore hit thin they ignore him and they ignore many other veterans just like him because they're sharing literally personally\nWe've kind of you know I guess a vast majority of mine have that hurt veteran\nYeah butler and\nI felt for a Democrat from our mind you know with some comments that until they get more power they will be a server\nAnd they go low we kick them was was holder core core you raised and another good good good question there so let's let's let's go with the false assumption that test or\nHas helped veterans let's say okay well he he got me my mileage check and he got me my this and he got me my that\nIsn't there still I I think even if that were true which is not true even if that were true I I think there are still veterans who would vote against him because of the fact that you're right that\nYou know what my country\nMy freedom border security in this country not being invaded by legal Americans\nAnd and you know what hey you can keep my mileage check I shouldn't have had to drive to Helena to get health care in the first place he senator keep my mileage check but give me my tax cuts I Will guarantee you that that that would ever pennies he might try to give you in a mileage reimbursement", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "city": "Billings", "day": "24"}
