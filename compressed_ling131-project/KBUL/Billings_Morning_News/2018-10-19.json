much brief that keep in mind he spoke for probably an hour and ten minutes or as well but this was this was a brief excerpt of this deal but I think he made a very good point\nAbout all of the dark money piling into Montana to benefit Jon Tester all of the east coast and the left coasts special interest groups piling into the state to help the Jon Tester President Trump made a very good point here he says he says\nElection kicked into full gear here this summer he's been benefiting from them even before that member over eighty percent\nWhen the campaign numbers came out earlier this year over eighty percent of his campaign contributions came from\nOutside the state of Montana\nSince these are the people propping up liberal Democrat Senator Jon Tester's campaigns\nAnd so when when President Trump was was basically saying look\nThese groups out on the east coast and let's go do they really care about John tests or do they really are is that Jon Tester\nHe's just a vote for them [noise]\n... he's a vote for them he's not a vote for us he's in the back pocket of these special interest groups that's why he votes maybe he feels he has to that's why he voted down the line with

can find out what's going on in some of the other news also\nA but another clip I Want to share with you hear from President Trump in Missoula last night\nUm was an important point so and and we've gotten some phone calls\nAbout another clip I Want to share with you hear from President Trump in Missoula last night\nUm was an important point so I and and we've gotten some phone calls from some of you I I've thrown at the question have what's the one issue that you think President Trump and a Republican Senate candidate ... what's the one issue if you had to break it down to one issue what's the one issue they should make this November election about and many of us that border security\nBuild that wall in fact there were a lot of build that wall\nSigns in chance last night in Missoula [noise] um well all of this is happening in the midst of this big caravan of you heard about this four thousand man caravan as trying to come up from South and Central America or in in in illegally cross the border and into the United states if if you heard about this I mean they literally just wants to invade this\nCountry they don't want to follow the law [noise] um they don't want to\nYou know there there's a lot of military age males that are in that care of and that apparently don't want to stay and\nFight for the safety and security of their own country and their own homes and their own neighborhoods like we do back here in Montana and in America and said they just want to come here and get a bunch of free stuff right uh well ... President Trump or not only did he thank the Mexican government\nFor working to stop that caravan before it even gets to the U.S southern border um but of course he also went after John tester for being in support of sanctuary cities and open borders\nUm but he also that it always said you know I thought I'm gonna I'm gonna take some of the blame he said I can you believe it I'm going to take some of the blame is set up I'm going to take some of the blame for this caravan of illegal immigrants friend across our border and uh he said well how come\nWhy will I take some of like well I'll tell you about that but first we do have a clip of thanks to Fox News radio what President Trump had to say regarding a this migrants caravan our producer Travis we'll fire that audio clip up for us [noise]\n... actually you know what Travis might be in\nThe other studio he's tracking down some more audio for us so\nSo in case that audio didn't cliff don't worry we'll play it for a little bit later today uh but uh uh but ... but what he basically said was that yeah I I'm going to take credit for this or you know I'm gonna take the blame for this a migrant caravan coming north in say she says\nI've created such an incredible economy\nMore people want to come here now they want to come here I I also partly wonder this is me talking here in addition to what President Trump had to sit here\nI I also partly wonder if these you know migrant caravans kind of figure hey look President Trump and the Republican Congress they're going to keep working to build this wall if if we don't get and now\nIt might be game over a now of course if if John tester were to get reelected and Democrats that can take over control the house of representatives or you could probably kiss the walking by\nA because it's very clear they they have no ... liberal Senator Jon tester and congressional Democrats have no desire nor no intention of building a wall in the southern border and remember all of the mess that's flowing into Montana's coming across our southern border uh so so\nThat that's where it's all coming from All right let's get into some of these Associated Press news headlines forty

Tester for supporting sanctuary cities open borders and much more um\nWell breaking away from the politics so but I did want to share that clip with our listeners especially during this drive time as folks are heading into work I'm breaking away from the politics of it necessarily we do know that the border ties in with the drug debate the the math that's flowing in across the southern border here in Montana via the Mexican drug cartels I'm\nKurt on me I I Know that's you know talking with you before that's been part of the pile up a of of drugs coming in the end of the state here in an added to some challenges there but um when we talk about project safe neighborhoods in the in the progressive scene in Yellowstone county in the past few months are starting to see some early indications elsewhere across Montana now also [noise]\nWhere we are here and um we've been not only folks in Yellowstone county we've been focusing these law enforcement effort statewide and they result in over a hundred and eighty seven\nA defendant's charged state wide uh and as you point out a lot of the masses coming\nFrom Mexico it's coming up here in Yellowstone county alone in the last six months we've\nWe together with all of our law enforcement partners have seized over a hundred and sixty pounds of math that's over five hundred and eighty thousand doses of math\nHave not yet the street with a street value of over\nSeven point two million dollars so you can see where\nWe're dealing with a substantial problem here and it isn't just in Yellowstone counties you point out it's state wide and so we're trying to be sure that\nWe're focusing statewide on this problem\nYeah a hundred and sixty pounds of math what does that mean on the streets [noise]\nAbout five hundred and eighty thousand doses air and [noise]\n... say again say again there occurred I think I lost you for just second\nFull sorry earned a hundred and sixty pounds of math is as a hundred and five hundred and eighty thousand doses\nAnd it has a street value of seven over seven point two million [noise]\nThat's incredible when you take that hundred and sixty pounds to over seven million because yeah basically part of the reason why they're flowing up here to Montana's because they can get so much money\nA hundred and sixty pounds to over seven million because yeah basically part of the reason why they're flowing up here to Montana's because they can get so much money more money even for just announced that compared to what they might get in Salt Lake city or Denver right\nThey can and it also they'll they'll er there's a lot of drugs being paid for by firearms that then gets smuggled down south [noise]\nDuring this process here we've seized or law enforcement seized fifty two firearms including six assault rifles\nAnd a lot of uh we have a lot of violent offenders in this community the U.S marshals violent offender taskforce also served two hundred and eighty eight warrants on violent offenders during that same time period [noise]\nDo you feel like you're you're starting to chip away at the problem or is it just such a massive problem in the state that\nThat that you know I 'cause I just know it can be frustrating for so many folks who are not only a law enforcement but also on the prosecutorial side like yourself 'cause 'cause you see the other end of this you see the heartache and the pain and Montana families as a result of the drug problems and everything else\nThere and I think we are starting to chip away at it but there's more to be done\nSix months into Yellowstone county and again this is sort of the canary in the coal mine out here this is where we're seeing things happen first because we got started here are a little sooner\nFirst quarter of this year we saw a twenty nine percent increase in violent crime in Yellowstone county\nAnd in the next two quarters after we started BSN\nTo our old twenty ... twenty Seventeen level so we haven't seen much of a decrease compared to previous years but at least we reduce the spike and we're seeing it level out\nNow our goal is to see if we can push violent crime down not just in Yellowstone county\nIt's not just the law enforcement efforts Aaron is you know um we're\nWe're certainly focusing on those enforcement uh\nThose enforcement tools that we have\nWe're also trying to work in our communities to to focus on treatment and prevention\nAnd a drug diversion to reduce demand for math\nYeah well that's yeah that you point out I mean a project safe neighborhoods aside I Know that federal court cases it can be a challenge because you know they don't allow the news cameras in so they don't get the flashy attention sometimes that other cases might get but there's been some incredible um cases and in\nThat that have been coming out of federal court right now would have been aside for projects have neighbors would have been some of the major cases that you've been focused on from the U.S attorneys birch\nWell we've had some significant civil cases to air and ah we've had\nA false claims act settlement case out of the Flathead regarding a\nInvolving Kalispell regional hospital\nWe continue to have a significant violent crime cases coming\nFrom the six reservations where the federal government has primary felony enforcement\nOr we're always focused in those areas or you know recently we've had a significant human trafficking case a\nCame across the state and it was connected to the Bach and so there's a lot of there's a lot of activity going on not just violent crime\nYeah that's true in fact yeah you mentioned the that the deal is flat hit a regional health care and the hospitals there that was a big story\nUm for those in billings we've got a big health care industry and building so they might be interested what happened there in um I'm trying to recall a memory here but it was it was a case of over billing some some fraud that was going on there and we're talking millions and millions of dollars right [noise]\nWell yes it it's a\nIt's a little complicated but essentially hospitals doctors various providers\nEach other to provide\nA higher

dentistry is concerned um\nWe have some implant companies they're donating some implants to us that uh that we work with um we're we're going to do thirty implants or dental implants and in addition to any other services that that's may need cleaning extraction feelings or you name it we're going to do with that day\nYou know that's that's pretty cool that you guys are doing that especially because you know from first hand experience especially now you know I think it's probably going to start getting better and the next year or two um thanks to some of these\nWell I'm I was really glad what's what's we had a you know a good reason to well we always got to read and to get up to take a show on the road I like getting out on patrol and some military veterans out there know what I mean you know you don't even want to be stuck in a desk you got to get out there you got to get out and\nSee the world but uh so we like to get out of the studio even with our great view there at the top floor double tree hotel in downtown ... was it like to get out of the studio get out and talk with folks first hand but I also knew and when we were going to come to Missoula\nOf four to cover the president's rally last night I I I remember running and the colonel James risk and him telling me about some of the great work that's being done at the University of Montana at their neural injury center and he said hey you got to talk with his folks on the radio like heck yeah let's let's make it happen in so luckily\nOr this week I said hey I'm going to be in Missoula let's see if we can talk with these folks and now a sitting across from the table here with us at paradise falls in Missoula\nIs Cindy ... she's the chief operating officer for the neural injury center at the University of Montana\nCindy great to see a thanks for coming down here ...\nYeah thanks for having us there and I guess it gets gets you out of the office for ... yeah well that's always a good thing [laughter] so\nHow would you do I know the neural injuries center is is a fairly new to the University of Montana within the last four years or so how would you describe the work that you're doing at the neural injury center\nWe we were actually founded I'm specifically with emissions help students patterns on campus um and those suffering or her who may have a suspected brain injury um there's there's a pretty high attrition rate of student veterans\n'em when they come into school because just re in integrating back into that environment it's difficult and you can only imagine how much harder is if you might have a head injury um some of them diagnose some of them not diagnosed yet [noise] um and so we wanted to help with that and\nOur our center is actually focused on screening veterans and athletes and then also doing you know cutting edge research and education [noise]\nUm so we do public education like what we're planning to do is um [noise] uh in partnership with colonel immersed in billings and march\nPlanning to do with um [noise] uh in partnership with colonel more risque and billings and march um\nYeah [noise] but we have some really interesting um ways that we work we have we bring veterans than to be screened for brain injury and we do a lot of things that are clinical screening but we also integrate them at the cutting edge research that we do\nUm and and that um [noise] includes you know pretty thorough intake a neurological exam um some very um state of the art killer motor tracking we have some really nice clip meant for doing that um we do cognitive casting\nWe do we have a virtual reality carbonated testing system that we\nReally furniture radicals that there is a cool virtual reality video game store the metal rod mall and filling but so how does this virtual reality testing works\nBut yeah no pretty much like um you know\nA lotta virtual rallies and she put on goggles um and then within the system you go through a series of cognitive tasks settings that includes um [noise]\nYou know like things like trail making in memory task basic functions of the brain um but it's a lot more engaging in it's in a three dimensional environment where\nThe step used to happen you know like filling out a form\nWhich really doesn't engage people sometimes they can hardly stay awake to take the test and we find that are that are in really enjoy actually doing this it can be tiring um but it it's very engaging\nSo maybe taking a step back here so so you started because there's hundreds maybe over a thousand that I'm not sure the latest a veteran woman\nNumbers you probably know that I Know at one time seven eight hundred veterans on the University of Montana campus probably imagine numbers are similar today that's correct\nYeah so you so you you got this population and many of them yeah so they come back from overseas and what what was so so you started this as a way just to help the students or the student veterans\nAnd then I imagine like wait a minute we're on to something bigger if we can help the students we can also help all veterans who has what was kind of that just didn't point raised where you went from okay we're not just going to focus on the students are veterans ...\nWe've got some breaking stuff there that can help all that\nWell I think that the particularly the reach of our research will ultimately help anyone that suffered a concussion and um we we kind of take because we're small\nAnd we have to you know we made student veterans our priority and we also see a lot of athletes um at our center um [noise] but\nUm we cake kind of on a case by case basis additional people from out indicating [noise]\nIt everything we're doing really is helpful to anybody in the community that suffered a concussion but we're not big enough to you know really take everybody all comers you know there's so\nMuch cross over these days you know what a veteran might have a for a you know a brain injury have somebody falling off a horse and we have a higher numbers of these types of injuries are my cars are\nOutdoors we're got moves and heavy industry is an agriculture but it also could be from you know a concussion at a at a football game or something like [noise]\nI Know a C. P. E. as something that's getting more attention I'm hearing that free our academic more now what is the the and how does that playing with a work in research\nYou're probably hearing about it through the\nNFL and things like that where it's\nA really important issue and it just it's thought that um it's chronic traumatic encephalopathy and\nIt's really thought that repeated head injuries can lead to that and it can actually be fatal but it doesn't happen with ...\nReally that well understood yet you know why some people are going to have that happen\nBut you will see with just about anybody that has multiple has been hit multiple times [noise] um that they will start to experience some kind of cognitive decline and other issues related to a brain\nInjury to the veterans who are coming to your neural injury center at the University of Montana\nWhat what were the the conditions are the precursors what were the things that were leading them to say hey I can keep your check\nMe out can you help me yeah that's a really good question um [noise] a lot of individuals that we see have\nThey maybe have been partially um\nScreen by the VA for when they got out of the military they filled out a questionnaire or something but that's about all that happened so they they come in they um are having problems they had a [noise] we [noise] with memory with sensitivity to light or sound\nYou know some of the Homer Simpson that they have but you can imagine in school when they're experiencing problems with learning and comprehend the in memory that can be\nEasily agitated is that orderly agitated because you have your partly wonder okay and I just getting older is that why that bright sun coming from the side of my days are yeah you know or or is it just because you're getting older you become becoming an older crotchety your guy that you become how do you know whether\nThese are just normal throwing up and and aging conditions versus like actually no you should probably check that out well\nIt's a complicated thing because um there are you know a lot of veterans come with the TST as well and there are a lot of overlapping symptoms of kind of increased anxiety and er it ability and things like that\nUm start you know just that that scene maybe similar to brain injuries and there's actually a lot of work being done on kind of what the biological\nCrossover there between the two\nAnd a lot of the people we see maybe even up to half of them have TPS the as well as the vi\nThe sorting that out isn't simple\nBut when it comes with your bell got wrong if you're you have a traumatic brain injury discovered because something bad happened and I ... and yeah he was\nLike hard ball something\nHuh yeah so there's you can have a an injury which is a blow to the head or you can have an injury that caused by a blast force where your brain just move you know things around inside your skull basically for there's kind of two types of\nInjuries and we see a lot of people that have been exposed to blast forces and said you are using more IDs and these conflicts that we see but usually it's that they're having\nProblems that they don't know why\nAnd they've they've they've had the symptoms that have either gotten worse or they've been kind of chronic and so we kept them in our tests compare people to those without brain injuries\nSo we have norms for people that are brain injured and not and so when we say do your eye tracking cast and it looks like the movement of your eyes is different\nThan a person without a brain injury we have certain aspects of that that we believe to be associated with a concussion\nBecause of injury snow\nOne of the things that I I almost don't want to get to ahead of ourselves here yet because I really want to say this this piece for the nine o'clock hour when we go stay why because I think because what does it will be on shorter time in an article at our because we might have a bunch of stopping in most

it\nCertainly is a place to be what it comes on and we appreciate you lead them to have a little airtime we always like yellow airtime no matter where we can get it\nWe've been doing a local show here for about thirty five years and we started the bonds you know the radio show of course Twenty years ago and we're in our twentieth ears so we're a in full swing right now with the general opening a rifle and deer\nElk and a elk and deer rifles season starts tomorrow a antelope sees has been going on we had water policies and\nI'm just a lot of activity going on and and what the weather the way it's been\nRecently there's a lot of fishing going on very good\n... yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah in fact I saw a ... well this was probably a while back but I say you guys are doing some salmon fishing out that for a fact that's what I Love even though I Know you're based in western Montana you never forget\nTheir Montana back there for the governors cup every all the time you get back as they get some good salmon fishing out there with three cats to recap the summer fishing and how that was a there was a lot of water I Know that in fact in the fly fishermen that for the rest of the folks out how was it across the well\nA lot of water of the type of fish and that I Do which is on the reservoirs is very good because Fort pack had um\nLike twenty there elevation there full pool is twenty two fifty elevation\nAnd they were running around twenty to forty six twenty to forty seven [noise] pretty much all summer and the more water you have in a reservoir like that the better the fishing is because it's just good for fishing in general the the bait fish multiply and of course the um\nThe game fish to feed on those bait fish to fry fish and it's interesting because we've talked a lot of wall I fisherman around them or fishing over there and I spent quite a few days over there on the on the on the lake and they said you know it's different this year because the water levels so high that you go to\nThe spot that you normally would go to wall I fishing kissing wall eyes during June and they just aren't there so you had to work a little bit harder for him\nThen once you've you did find them and you find out where the wall eyes were hidden and boy I tell you what they really were it was really is a very good days yet when I probably had the best days I had the worst days and they had the best days of fishing on Ford pick up probably since I've been fishing that reservoir for Thirty years\nSo heading into rifle season what was the chatter around the table here this morning we'll hear crew gather here for it I saw so that we had a local game wardens or pepper and him with questions to make sure we don't do anything wrong the way they said you know Utah hunting\nOr they started yesterday and today so if you're you you could go hunting and you you have to have a an adult with you but they cannot hunt and so that's been going on all across the state so that's been pretty good and then you know the general seasons pretty good but one of the things I I was going to mention is that\nYou know we hunt a lot in all over the states and I can tell you one thing right now\n... most impact all of the ranchers that I Know of course you got to ask permission to get on and all that stuff but they are you know speaking of the Trump rally that was here in Missoula last night they are more optimistic right now\nThan any time I've ever seen him as far as you know I mean because I asked him I said what do you think about the terrorists because it's affecting the commodity\nPrices will well this was the one issue earlier this year that they thought they could use against a President Trump against the Republicans but we've had some big gains on that you know\nA new NAFTA basically well\nWhat they're looking at is a long term they aren't looking at the short term\nShort term and that's what they're telling me and because I was interested to find out what they're doing because that's hitting their bottom line too but they're looking at in the long term if we can get these trade situations handled that they're going to be\nA you know making some money again and and then of course when the agricultural community makes money in a state like Montana there's there's nothing better but I I just wanted to comment on that that there are more optimistic for President Trump being it offers than they ever were\nBack back when and and you know I mean that just because I think he's doing what he said he was going to do\nWell that optimism is probably good when you're knocking on that door to even go hunting out on a place and you know if they're a little happier like oh yeah yeah come on out here and\nOf course it's it is but it's those private land or the farmers and ranchers who are so good with with a wildlife habitat and an access out there too and and sometimes they don't give them a pat on the back to that they really should get out there across the safety of our\nBlock management's a big big deal for folks are you know going in and getting permission to do that a outfitters or also will put money into their pocket\nSo it's you know some ranchers have an outfit or some ranchers are so big they'll have an outfit or that they'll do business with but also a block management and some other places so it's\nIt's really a hybrid of everything and you gotta have vote\nI think to make things work in the main thing is is the relationship aspect is words that and if you want if I was going to give a recommendation anybody is to try to try to meet the the rancher if if they're going to go do some branding volunteer to help them at all times\nYou know it's always fun yeah it's always fun if they're going to get a buffet after potluck afterwards\nTo one of the things we're doing now is they're ... they're going to be getting separating or their cabs to do go to market and stuff so um that's the other thing that the Sears are going to be going to market so that's another thing they need help within and I ... you know I'm probably will draw the line when it comes to help fencing\nI Do I have more than ... didn't mean than he does and I have none I use\nAnd I was around [noise] but\nThe only good thing he did I think he probably does while ago it gives you middle school out of business but I think the only good thing he did that I Can't call her book is anymore\nRight and I came up with a bow God they once said you must apologized for that does it why not nice what you're doing I said okay I'd like to apologize to the real no God\nThat\nThe big one river ... Elizabeth Warren is not\nAll right All right all the right there yeah president Donald Trump at the rally last night in Missoula I didn't see an official count yet the thousands and thousands of people showed up yet\nAh hey I'm here paradise falls in Missoula joined here at the breakfast table with us we got down Riverdale and the captain mark ... from the Montana outdoor radio show\nWhat we're calling him down low Dale when we talk politics if it's outdoors several calling downriver or if it's a outdoors or if it's a political but first I thought well\nAnd it had you heard the ah the Elizabeth Warren clip yet I don't know if you were there last night as you heard that Elizabeth Warren\n... wasn't there but I I watched the speech on the television so yeah\nYou do you think from an outdoors perspective that the second amendment issue especially given the Supreme Court battles as a big issue for for you know for outdoors going across the state\nWell that might be a little bit above my pay grade um you know I just like I said before I I look back at I've been traveling to save for Thirty years and\nThe folks that work hard the farmers or ranchers a main street usa they just seem to believe in trough and they believe in him for a lot of reasons uh he's doing what he said he was going to do\nHe's not running for a party I realize these are the Republican Party but he's not doing it for the party he's doing it for\nThe people that elected him and that's the difference I think that they're looking at is that um some of these other politicians are politicians are more loyal to the party and the art of the folks that actually elected him\nYeah or they're too afraid to fight back or to do a really needs to be I mean it's kind of like the Canadian grain inspections for for us we for example everybody said it was a problem but nobody ever did anything about it until a Donald Trump\nWell download dead or today so you got your World War two veteran buddy and big thanks to him for his service and uh but you got him so you're coming into the Trump rally now I Know they had a they had extra buses for people with wheelchairs and things like that but uh [noise] what\nWhat time did you get there and did you did it because when I got there there was a massive line I mean the line\nRoad off into the sunset it was so long just to get on the buses to get over the rally and it was at four o'clock yesterday afternoon well we we were very fortunate that are\nVeterans are are very very very important\nIssue to President Trump and uh so [noise] a U.S ally\nThe other veterans war um\nHad a special access and so we were move right to the front of the line and move right in there so we didn't have to wait to 'em or or do any of that which\nI Can't take the president enough for that but it just shows his commitment to veterans is so strong and and the way that they treated not just John but all the veterans that we're\nAll sitting together and and\nThat all of his people made sure we were comfortable that we had everything and that we could see very well and\nAnd there was a big group of veterans that were you at the ... kind of hearing from them why why they were there what they like about well what they see as the sincerity\nAnd and that's I think the biggest difference is they don't feel like they're being used for political means they're getting the Senate stump speech rights groups that this guy is sincere about it and I think a huge part of it is the the whole\nPromises kept the him\nThat he's so long we have heard whether it's the gesture campaign or really Republicans any of that have used veterans is\nIs kind of a a tool to get that vote is the campaign from ... find three or four guys changes at the VA nothing happens in now and when President Trump came and she took time to listen and\nThings started to change and people that were a really in essence neglecting a veterans in the VA and that\nGot fired and that's something we haven't seen yeah and so all the veterans at the rally were supporting him because not because we as a politician but because\nShe's doing what they're what they expect from a commander in chief which is this is what I expect out of view and this is what you can expect out of me and you talk about a command presence I share this photo on Twitter and Facebook Twitter dot com at arm's length but the the you know the\nBeautiful sunset over the mountains in Missoula the mountains in the background with the crowd on the rise or is in the background air force one little ...\nI mean you
