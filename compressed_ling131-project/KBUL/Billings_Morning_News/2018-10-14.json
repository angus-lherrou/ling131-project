Stein distinguished professor of public health center city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually say most people are faced with such high co payments some good doctor bowls that they are in deep financial trouble even if they have coverage so many of us have policies but\nIm dollars deductible before the insurance\nKicks in and even after that a lot of policies say when you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and a hospital stay can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now than did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar to Dr phil and this country and that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so deductibles are rising and co payments are rising and\nAs you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which\nHave help people but have still left them in deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of six thousand dollars now for most families a six thousand dollar head\nThat comes when you're sick and frankly in danger of losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected\nBut how common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all that what's the average bill for example that's left for someone to pay out of pocket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews sought to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we wanted to know what are the financial consequences of that\nAnd does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do this really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports just like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies we merged all of those credit report records with\nHospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat's Dr Matthew no to dig do associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also co author of this study which search millions of hospital in financial records he\nSays there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise but the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well\nWe do see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average\nMan their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with the deductibles and co payments on their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis they had was that some individual just might not understand exactly what they need to pay or there could be ongoing disagreements about exactly what they need to pay and some of those disagreements might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency\nHowever it's a little different for those without insurance the average patient is in the hospital for five days or so according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and no till would did go says there yet with higher unpaid bills as you'd expect yet it something else that hurts them the most financially\nAfter going to the hospital if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills and most of that almost all of it goes away if you are in short but whether you're insured or uninsured both groups seem to be affected by a hospital admission in terms of their labor earnings\nBut whether you're insured or uninsured both group seemed to be affected by a hospital admission in terms of their labor earnings\nTheir earnings declined by about twenty percent on average and that lasts for a number of years so it takes quite a while for people to go back to normal and for many people we also see some evidence that they ended up retiring early claiming Social Security earlier and in some cases even applying for disability insurance\nNo till we did go says that the most ... finding of this study it's not medical bills that put the average family under financially when they're sick\nFor many people it seems difficult for them to return to work after they go to hospital and you know once we saw that it's not really that surprising I mean for some individuals when they go to the hospital to serious\nEvent it might make working more difficult there might be short term or even long term disability maybe it's not so surprising but it's not something we were thinking about it ahead of time which is just that after you go to the hospital and suffer\nSome kind of health shocked that so serious that you end up meeting this medical treatment\nPeople return to work slowly and they end up experiencing earnings losses reductions in income for them to actually for their entire household that persists for many years\nIn many ways he says the labor dislocation after major illness looks like a town where the major industry has suddenly closed\nAnd everyone loses their job and then they have to go back and try to find work in many of those case studies people take a long time to get back to where they were before and I think what was surprising to me it's just for how many people that looks very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\nHe almost Stein says that's a major reason debts that occurred during a medical crisis or potentially much more damaging and lasting vendetta from things like credit cards everything falls apart at once\nIt comes at a time that's the worst time in your life so sheer gravely ill and running up big medical bills that's a time when your earnings are going down at the same time if the bills are coming in and of course\nThe stress of illness and the disaster of illness is coming up the same time as a medical bills are coming yeah so that's different than buying a house or running up a bill on your credit card for other things\nIt's done in a capsule form or tablet form and we recommend that people take that tablet over a period of Ninety Days if your hormones aren't balanced\nAnd it's going to have some effect and creating some kind of burden to your system [noise]\nWe've found that ... and ... says the delivery of those messages to all the organs that are affected and as a result we think it's a great compliment to your body but she put it that way\nBut how do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance or not it's hard to say but even if you doubt men she says Polley a mean supplements are still safety is\nThe concept of overdose doesn't apply to a certain number of things right\nAnd it turns out that you just can't eat enough vegetables\nTo poison yourself on vegetables we've never even seen that before my goodness we've actually seen people drink too much water and actually poison themselves with water\nBut we've never seen an individual eat so many vegetables that they poison themselves on vegetables it's just not possible and this is the the safety factor of the ... poly means\nThese are things we normally get in plants and in the plants that we need the most so we have no toxicity level to them if we're eating or vegetables and we're taking the ... we're still not going to have an overdose circumstance will just be more stress resistant more bullet proof when it comes to\nThe stress that we face every day\nThe key factor many people don't realize that they do or don't have a hormonal imbalance until it's tested then that's done through a saliva test\nHowever the breakthrough science have Polly means isn't something you may hear much about since the end result isn't a drug it's a supplement then Darrow says supplements operate under FDA rules that generally prevent manufacturers from saying much about them\nAnd certainly there are barriers that the FDA has put in place obviously their interest is safety\nAnd with a supplement their interest again is basically safety\nAs far as making claims we can claim that we've been able to help assist promote but at the same time you're correct there are certain disclaimer that obviously the FDA has employees that prevent us from really\nGetting the real total message wrote there as to what the product couldn't do\nThere's a reason for that men she says it's important to notice the difference between supplements and drugs\nAre not treatments for disease and these are promoters of wellness you don't cure anything you do\nOpponents and drugs these are not treatments for disease these are promoters of wellness you don't cure anything you don't prevent anything you don't treat anything with bio Janet ... means but\nIf you want to have the energy not just to get through the day but if you want to have the energy to be

entire experience of life you need to eat the foods that we're designed to eat\nI think it's important to realize that it's not going to solve all problems but it's an alternative to what's out there and right now what's out there is limited\nAnd probably beyond a lot of people's means and we think it's a product that can enhance an affect different problems that are in different parts of the

nation how the United states became the most unity of democracy in the world\nIf we look back at the data back into the Nineteen fifties\nThe U.S incarceration rate wasn't especially distinct in fact it was in between the incarceration rate of Finland and Denmark\nSo this has been a decades long process to get to this title of the world's incarceration leader and started really in the seventies eighties through the nineties and it was mostly due to political changes policy changes in terms of\nChanging mandatory sentencing so crimes that previously didn't carry a prison sentence having a mandatory sentence extending the life of sentences\nRules like three strikes laws where a third convicted felony could lead to for example in California twenty five year to life sentence these changes in how we punish certain crimes are the main factor in the rise of mass incarceration\nAnd says that now there are about to point two million people incarcerated in the U.S and it's not just the fault of the politicians he sensed that the public with the help of the media took a tougher line on law and order during the last part of the twentieth century\nAs the crime rate was going up in the sixties and seventies and media was covering this media tends to cover crime in a certain way can sue over report violent crime focus more on violent crime\nTends to focus on the specific nature of the crime as opposed to talking about the broad picture and ways to maybe address the roots of crime or social issues\nThe media reporting on rising crime rates in a very specific way was a major factor in why the public became so punitive and the first place\nAnd says that ironically the big headline crimes are the ones that put the majority of people in prison\nSo a lot of the increase in the incarceration rate was changes and how we prosecute low level drug offenders like possession of small amounts of illegal drugs\nOr those ... buying drugs and so of course violent crime is part of

sell them and kind of getting our homes ready for the chillier months of the year will just put it that way and we talk a little bit about inflation by the way if you have a question you can dial up it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five\nI'm One of the things we were just talking about whole house in ... becomes very very effective if you have a furnace or the air handler up in the attic\nUm maybe not as effective up and really core parts of the country that we're seeing that whole concept migrate throughout the country but very very popular southeast southwest are seeing the whole house in capsule Asian or if you're not going that route awhile soon cap solution we talked about just adding\nInsulation in bringing your home up to where the department of energy would recommend it to be in terms of our value\nOr another thing you need to factor in in that is\nVentilation so if you're not a whole ... totally you gotta have ventilation the ... the hot air out of the addict\nIt'll still warm up remember you're in slaying that buffer the ceiling between the addict and the living quarters of the home uh but we'd like to see that at a temperature not be a hundred and forty degrees right if we can keep that lower\nThe better off we are in the wintertime if moist air gets in there we want to get that to exhaust so what you need to be certain of is that the soft advance of Fela mentioned about to soften sense though I wouldn't need soft advance he wouldn't in a whole house in ...\nBut if it's a you know just the insulation on the floor of the fiberglass the cellulose that type of thing you need a of ventilation that addict\nIs probably one of the things if I looked at as the most screwed up part of any home is ventilation renamed ventilate homes in Nineteen Seventy five I Would say and then we started realizing we get that heat out it's more you know the conditions are more livable inside dome\nSo we got the soft advance which in some cases some homes that's bringing the Cold War cooler not cold cooler air\nInto the ... especially like in the summertime is Ninety degrees outside it still cooler than what it is and yet she bringing the cooler areas so those need to be clean I mean\nThey can't be painted over it they can't be sealed there can't be insulation all over the screen material on the inside the addict there can't be spider webs it's gotta have good air flow through there\nAnd then you've got the ridge mentor you got the shoe box vents on the roof to pull the air\nOut so good ventilation also the key so it is insulation and ventilation eight hundred eight to ... to five five and a Nazi Carl once talked about whole home generators and that's a good thing to have a pretty much any time during the during the year Karl welcome\nThank you I met on the corner and the general generator and I'm just wondering which wasn't made it on our looking at the fourteen and the only thing\nYeah well he's either want are kind of I kind of like the cold or the cold\nRun around Nineteen twenty yeah they were the first one and and\nThe other one was started in Nineteen fifty eight now and I know it causes a little bit more money I hear that they made a whole lot better for like a foreigner here any customer you hand that had a man with the what they like come on\nI can tell you I don't know about the oil okay that's kind of in the operation of it and then the owner's manual and the directions and all that so\nI Can't really offer an opinion on that I can However I've interviewed the folks from Jenna wrecks on this show okay I've also interviewed the people from Koehler on this show no I'd say they're both good pieces of equipment to be honest with you but you're right\nThere is a lot of security in the name of Koehler fray they actually created that so um you know folks could buy appliances brand in the rural areas because there was an electricity so they created the generators\nDo actually HIV appliances in rural ... in rural areas they are awesome Carl they really are I've done some uh TV segments with a whole house generators to 'em but uh yeah they like everything else you know it means maintenance\nProbably needs less maintenance than a portable generator break but boy when you have a power failure I mean it's like ... seconds and that thing just gauges and away we go\nWell one thing I asked ... asked the guy that you know I had a generator portable generator or got over twenty five years however in that thing six eight hours at a time that thing that never broad drop oil out for that guy looked at me so\nThis is why I don't make no sense to me yeah\nWell when you said it again I haven't read the operation manual when you said it I thought wow that's that's that's pretty strong eight hours right um now what are you going to run it on is it going to run on a natural gas or natural gas\nYeah throw gas yeah right yeah I Know they uh have little service agreements and that catches people by surprise occasionally for anywhere you know you gotta have that um you looked at at least the last thing you want to do it but not functioning when you needed ...

there's a lot of threats that occur at the bottom of the door if you don't want to get into that or maybe you don't have the final a seal that slides into the threshold one of the things you can do she can install a door sweep you've seen that\nUm it's either aluminum color a brass color or even a brown color now\nAnd it's got a vinyl sweep or it's just a bus to the side of the threshold now really mess and what's the threshold some thresholds owning the vinyl seal but adding a door sweep\nReally take time and the next week and just kind of examine those areas I I I always see in modern living\nIn with newer homes were not always really paying attention to her front door we we'd all go in and out we go into the garage and we enter a enter into the house\nAnd in we don't pay attention to our front door so a lot of times we weather stripping that's failing\nAnd we pay no attention to it so I Want you to take a look at it\nYou can replace it the better quality of weather stripping

talk about how to rectify that problem buddy and take a call or two in the meantime let's get back to the phones cliff welcome [noise]\nThat's ... ... yes there were down in Georgia and we just bought a\nA modular home which is not to on the ... mobile home in Nineteen eighty and we have some control problem wherever and replace them and you know that old a particle borders the floor and try to browse it up\nIs just a a ... a size of your hand it just breaks or is there a better way to take that up the\n... so you're just talking about removing the particle board removing\nThe iron correct and how have you removed it at this point\nA trial bar and a hammer and every time you go to a prize or the face of break off the size of your hand and yet they moved to the small face\nYou know I don't know of an easier way I mean you're just that's you know that sounds like that part of ... borders to a point where it's no longer solid and you got to get it off the ah the bracing if you will and you know the board has been compromised I don't know an easier way to get it off\nNow yeah the floors are real soft origin we're moving along going back with a full backing\nYeah and that's just it's terrible\nAnd I was all that it takes about ... and\nI don't know of an easier way to do it unless you um you know in between the support beams if you took a sledgehammer ... broken down that way and then concentrated on lifting with a sledgehammer the pieces that are left on the support\nWell underneath the flow to us that they have that insulation that sealed off from the bottom if you must have for the lifetime of your life now\nYeah well I I don't know of an easier way to get it off it's just I mean it's it's a problem it it's a problem because that that board has been compromised so I mean no matter what you do it's going to end up on the inflation correct\nWell no I mean some of the small small stuff does but the new ... shot back shot back that out\nAbout getting a ... like I can you get a circular so I I mean I I can see exactly you know what it looks like can you get like a circular saw and set adept gauge inning caught it and ...\nAnd between a four door so yeah ... and then try and lifted that way\nA way to try some of that but a a you wind up some of the flow of joy to have a a like a\nA sham peace like I'm On the face of that particle board losing stripe looked at the top of it [noise] mhm\nAnd if you get into that then you ruin the ah you know how the level of the floor\n[noise] mhm so in effect really what you're kind of asking me is how do I get it up as a solid piece in my answer cliff is and it sounds like you're not because it's already brought it to a point where it's just not going to come off um is going to come off in pieces which is the way you're\nLifting and often I don't know any easier way to make that happen because that's the composition of that sub floor so I you know if he can't cut sections of it and you don't want to crush it down because of the insulation I think you're kind of back to where you were\nAll right Bruce shades call twenty four minutes after the top of the Arab let's get to Tim Tim welcome\nCash I thank you

your house and over the years people do all kinds of small local I Do not Wal Mart hater but some people at Lowe's and Home Depot shelled the\nKerosene heaters mhm\nI Do not Wal Mart hater from people at Lowe's and Home Depot shelled the\nKerosene heaters mhm and\nI don't or different styles [noise] um how long do those normally last year there\nAnd uh [noise] um I don't hear your new maintenance just off on them like\n... other colleges that offer to use them and and mentioned um what do you think of those things well\nActually in some communities they're not allowed to be used um some communities are allowed to be used so um you know\nFirst you got to check if it's I'm OK to use them the secret is and the quality of the kerosene that's being burned a you've got to use grey day one\nOtherwise the residue will accumulate on that wick and it will smoke I'm also Tim\nI can tell you from a ... ... precautions standpoint I Would definitely have a a\nA carbon monoxide detector inside the home um\nBecause again you're not venting that out and there will be an odor and there will\nBe some a carbon monoxide whether it's unacceptable level or not depends on how ventilated your home is\nYou start doing it in a whole house encapsulated home you're going to have problems I Would not use it um the wick needs to be changed periodically um [noise]\nI Can't remember how ... how long you know how many how many hours of burn that has to be changed but the wick does have to be change fairly rarely\nDo they do they age out they get to a point where a daycare senior and it just gets old and he's just\nWell everything everything ages out um when you say how long something like that last I I don't know I'd say ten years old I mean you know ... how much maintenance is done the maintenance is all about the wick\nAnd they can be a little bit challenging putting those into um if you want my honest opinion I wouldn't use one in my home\nAnd some people that him they're going to like our area it's the best seat in the world but you know I personally wouldn't use one of my\n... which you are far well they've had try it I just think that the chill off ... off\n'cause it's not really thirty five you know thirty two degrees outside but just take the\nChill off ... while you're just sit and watch a football game or something like\nThat yeah yeah um well there's there's actually a couple of things some of those with the um the I forget the name of those things that the ah\nInfrared light heaters okay what those do exist don't take the chill out of the year but they warmed the person they're very cool now they're probably three hundred bucks\n[noise] ... got a ten thousand years or ten thousand hours were the life [noise]\nBut I Would take a look at that or even those cubes ceramic heaters there's so much safer more economical less more [noise]\nSorry I Hope that helps Tim coming up next we'll have arrows steel and we'll talk about saving money and keep it in the heat and air in your room where you want it\nThat's next year at home with Gary Solis [noise]\nYou don't have a list of things to do around the house Gary will find something for you one eight hundred to three calls and your whole theory\nTo talk in Ninety five point five [noise]\n\n\nHave you tried\n[noise]\nHave\nYou tried blaster is new t._v. how they're treating live seem Greece yet you really should blisters combine to make sure that the original TB plastered with white live in Greece for a time release penetrating action\nTo see whether they charge you ... you know like a blower door just for a house\nA it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests and there are similar to um ... different dealers approach it differently a you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways scary I mean you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find her up you know I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that\nThey were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have more evidence that fine well uh one of the easiest of course you mentioned that right when we began this the segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal for that\nColder than the rest of the how it is normal it's Ninety five percent of ... [laughter] ... right right\nBut um but if your duct tape is done is designed properly and working the way it's supposed to you and you've got a good working piece of equipment\nFrame right that's not supposed to happen that nice even temperatures throughout your hamster there's urine telltale signs and yes and a ... you know it's a big one that's where I knew it yeah on the grill or the register maintenance I before I before I was in this industry I thought that was just a normal thing and that that's kind of\nWhat we call infiltration meaning that can actually be pulling air\nLike a vacuum exactly the opposite right into the halls of the joints right right and I don't want to read that in mind that game I don't know about you yeah so then they say but I got a filter on my furnace it's all after the filter and that's right after that so it's kind of sucking in distributing that insulation all over your house\nThat's right okay and then I think the other big telltale sign that you you also mentioned is that a lot of homeowners will by higher efficiency furnaces are have fees and expect to see a big energy saving a\nBut then they really don't they really don't get that benefit they don't see it and then you know what's happening right now we're getting ... the savings and it's probably because\nThere's some kind of fish and the drain like Lincoln\nYeah and I I'll tell you have an ... maybe you agree with me maybe you want but if you just give you a basement in your home and you just kind of look at the duck worked in the basement in between the Joyce\nAnd you see gaps in I mean you kind of see what kind of duck works system you have because you remember for the most part the duck work we can't see it is in the advocates no walls it's in some places we can't get too but the basement you can see it\nAnd when I started looking into it myself before a cold or checked into the air seal um I started looking at this duck work is a mess\nAnd I'm getting up there was some silicone I'm getting there with aluminum tape and I started taking all these up and a and one that I had this aha moment and said\nWow this is just a basement wonder what's going on inside the wall I Can't see what's inside the wall\nExactly I agree with you and you're you're right\nA with a click examination of the part that you can see right it can be representative of oh my gosh what's behind the well in the attic what are you are right there right\nSo I had a company come out and they did the test with the air I think they stopped a closed the registers put little\nWhatever they put over shut 'em off shut them down and they tested the pressure so I had a four time an air conditioner in furnace for time and they were able to measure how much air I was getting through that duct work\nWhat most people get you know yeah I mean I I Know what my status was but is it twenty five percent fifty percent on average\nYeah on average it it's probably going to be in that twenty five to forty percent rain mine was twenty\nFive so it was a fork than you think about these folks there's four tons and I was losing one time heir\nMazie again you're not getting much paid for yeah I mean that's amazing and only five percent of the lot\nYet so it was like I really have a two and three ton you so it was too small for the house I mean you could look at it that way yet when they were finished it was one sixteenth of a tone I was missing because we're from one area I Can't remember what the issue was one sixteenth of a ton\nAnd they were in both from the testing in the application and it was a three quarters with a half a day I Can't remember what the full day and that's how\nIt so tell me what they use an error I I I mean it's almost like an ...\nWell the full day in ... and that's how\nIt so tell me what they use an era I I I mean it's almost like an aerosol and it\nTells a you know the fancy chemical naming the vinyl acetate polymer but that nobody has that is right to the non toxic components at the same ... going to find and things like chewing gum\nA baby pacifier is that it's completely safe and it's a liquid to begin with our system he had that turns into an aerosol and then that just like the guy who did it at your house they'll block off all the register so that\nThat that is as closed off and it can be ... by the aerosol through the system as I described before it'll find a little hole or where the air and leaking out scaling up from the outside and move on down the trunk line them up and down there all the old\n... now so we know what some of the benefits are going to be we'll talk about him but I'm sure everybody listening is like a cost and I know that's probably over all over the board but would you know what the return on investment is do you recoup that in two years three years five years or [noise]\nYeah and and again that that does very for sure uh across the country but and most homeowners are going to see a return within about three years three years yeah well you you return to comfort immediately well that's true I mean I could just so that the other way to look at it in\n... in some respects we're already spending that money mhm right to heat and cool you're home mhm portion of it at least in maybe not going where you want it to him in some little savings account right right right right you're already spending that money and now let's just put that air where you want it today are\nSet up slowly Daniel if somebody is a question regarding the arrows seal let's invite him in it's eight hundred eight to treat

it a dream or bathroom sink or what\nIt actually all of them okay that per se\nOkay but the thing that the cell phone records are highly it would be like an overnight\nYeah so what they're what they're saying is they're saying create that delusion okay before ... before you pour down the drain let it sit for ten minutes\nHuh let's say we had a vanity bowl and let's say we weren't going to put it in a bowl or something like that would just put it into any\nVanity you you put your amount of water in the ... you got the plug in it but the amount of water near put the forums was a dream about\nAnd just let it sit there for like ten minutes then all up the drain and all that remember there's a culture bacteria in there that's actually going to eat through the blockage read through the scum of the pipes\nAnd so once that facility is has set for a while and created enzymes that's when you're sending it down the drain\nFriday okay for them or one court will tell her\nNot at all not at all so you would ... if you're going to do it in a container do kind of pretty much the same thing you mix it up in the container and you just said that container sit for ten minutes\nNow if you're going to ask me kinda let's sit overnight before pouring down I'm going to say I don't know what a if you if you make that take that concentrate and take the water and mix it and let it stand for ten minutes and then pouring down the drain you're good to go\nOK okay and I thought okay for slight were hot water with a lot of for profit fair nope\nNope nope because it it's it's it's not an answer
