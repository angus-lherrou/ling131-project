anytime by calling ... tonight for zero nine Seventy is she's news talk Ninety five point five where Montana cause [noise] All right\nSo uh we're gonna talk about this with more detail in the inside and analysis here along with that a doctor David Parker Brett ... a political science professor from Montana State University who could basically a lead this poll along with the Montana television network\nA but still it's still the results today we've got the U.S Senate race results will talk about today for this poll and then I think maybe the moral or the next day we'll talk about the the polling in the U.S house race between congressman Greg gene forty and Democrat Kathleen lead so I'll give you the numbers now\nI'll give you the numbers now and a little bit of my thoughts so that that way when a Dr Parker comes on we we can focus more on his thoughts in his inside his analysis here so what what are the numbers first off what what are the number say so this is from Mike Mike Dennison report on the Montana television network\nRegarding their poll in the state's high profile US Senate race Democrat incumbent Jon Tester holding narrow lead over Republican challenger Matt Rosendale forty six percent to forty three percent according to a Montana television network\nMontana State University poll the mail ballot poll of more than two thousand registered voters conducted during a three week period in late September in early October\nHas an a margin of error a plus or minus a two percent so basically this race is a dead heat here uh it's it's a dead heat up plus I I Would also add this I said look some polls have shown Rosendale slightly ahead\nSome polls have shown tester slightly ahead so this poll is kind of in line with with that trend that we've been seeing here\nI'm here's so here's what's interesting here's what what I'm interested in as okay when was this poll done because member polls can sometimes be really just a a snapshot in time\nA sort of this poll was done how let me look at the exact date here I just had it in front of me is\nThat it's a fairly lengthy article here but I Swear I was just looking at the actual date of when this was taken but I Do remember this I'll get to the dates here and just a second I Do remember this though this polling was done here here's three reasons why I think this poll is very good news for Matt Rosendale\nOne I think what we saw on twenty sixteen if at all so hold and twenty Eighteen\nIs the polls\nBasically we're skewed against Republicans were skewed against us especially Trump voters and twenty sixteen and and that the Republicans actually did better than what the polling was saying they were going to do in twenty sixteen so if that's the case\nMatt Rosendale very likely could could be in the lead um even just based on these poll results because because maybe a polls never truly capture the support that's out there\nFor Republican candidates to begin with that one too it it appears that this polling took place early on uh in the cabinet confirmation hearings and I don't know about you but at least based on what I've been hearing on this show calls that we've been getting from across the state I think the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings\nReally angered and fired up a lot of folks not just Republicans but independent voters\nAre at the way Senate Democrats handled that whole whole deal so that's so so this pull may not have fully captured the full cabinet effect which who knows could be another three four\nPoints for Rosendale um the other thing uh is hey what about the Trump rally we just had President Trump in Missoula this past Thursday and as you heard in our interview with Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale\nMissoula yeah it might be the liberal stronghold in Montana but remember Missoula is still a very highly populated city and county when it comes to Montana\nMissoula has the second largest number of Republican voters in the state\nThat is huge so what that means is if Rosendale can just draw out a few more percentage points of conservatives in Missoula that can be enough to win a statewide race\nAnd I can guarantee you from being in Missoula last Thursday night that rally the estimated eight thousand people that were reportedly and attendance at that rally but not only that but the people across the city of ... Missoula that had their\nHere on Montana talk then will open up the phone lines for you for oh six to nine four zero nine Seventy anything and everything you want to talk about here on the show you can also drop me an email Aaron at Montana talks dot com right after this I'll tell you the top stories at Fox News radio tracking for us all morning long as well\n[noise]\nLike sued the state attorney general yesterday over whether his administration has the authority to unilaterally approved conservation\n... without going through state land board\nDemocratic governors petition to Montana Supreme Court\nSeeks to clarify the governors and state agencies power over a dispute over a six point one million dollar conservation these ... in eastern Montana that Bullock's fish wildlife and parks department finalized earlier this year without approval by the state land board\nSeventy seven year old Florence man who went missing south east of Hamilton during the opening day of big gamer rifle season has been found safe\nRally county sheriff Steve hoping she was a man whose name has not been released was conscious but required medical attention after he was found on Monday afternoon men had been hunting with others but didn't return to the drop camp in the daily creek area by noon on Saturday Montana talks and I'm Jeff how\nNow really very weather on news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\nTemperatures continue to be mild looked for mostly sunny skies today will pop out right around\nOther news talk Ninety five point five\nTemperatures continue to be mild looked for mostly sunny skies today will pop out right around sixty three degrees partly cloudy skies tonight dropping down into the lower forties and then mostly sunny tomorrow with warmer temperatures highs and the upper sixties let's look at your forecast for news talk on cue Jews\nLocal news every ... minutes and when it breaks sisters long talks with Aaron fluent on news talk thirty five point five [noise] fired here's\nThe top stories Fox News radio is tracking force all morning long right here on news talk Ninety five point five nine Seventy KB U L A President Trump has vowed to send as many troops as necessary to prevent a growing Central American migrants caravan from entering the United states\nTrump backed former rival Sen Ted Cruz calling his mid term opponent ... a phoney and accused Democrats of assaulting us sovereignty at a campaign rally in Houston, Texas last night\nAn explosive device was found that the west Chester New York home of billionaire George Soros last night according to reports\nDemocrats are expected to reopen the investigation on alleged Russian collusion if they retake the house in the mid term elections and another is investigators announced that they are looking for two\nVehicles of interest in the search for a Wisconsin girl who went missing after her parents were found slain in their home authorities are expected to expand the ground search for Jamie claws\nAre today on Tuesday arts that some of his top stories Fox News radio will be tracking for us here all morning long ah here's some of the highlights also from political playbook here two weeks to go before the election what happens if Democrats take over control of the U.S house of representatives of politicos playbook says this\nExpect that a big new class of Democrats is not going to want to work with the president on much\nI think we can all agree on that one they also said if Democrats win expect Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house meanwhile President Trump at that rally was Senator Ted Cruz last night in Texas\nA this was this was a story from ... Matthew Choi for Politico a Trump at cruise rally hits immigration has reason to vote GOP\nPresident Trump said quote this will be the election of the caravan Kavanaugh\nLaw and order tax cuts and common sense the president said referring to strategic themes that have come into focus in recent weeks including the Supreme Court confirmation battle for justice Brett Kavanaugh here's what he said specifically when it comes to that caravan I\nIs openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to regulate our laws\nOur borders and overwhelm our nation that was\nAll right now so why did the caravans keep coming a Lisa Kennedy Montgomery with Fox Business or has this ... this commentary why the caravans keep coming\nThis caravan through Mexico and turn into ridiculous political theater for both sides of passion banning\nTake precedence over things and then we know that another large paramount uh mostly undocumented Latin American making its way from El Salvador Honduras Guatemala through Mexico\nBut on the march summer coming to participate in our building an economy and tight labor market because here we are job mean higher wage it yeah that's right and I are separate from migratory phone no and there are literally jumping on the bandwagon because it's getting a lot of traction and attention well others are playing and a half\nOh and our literally jumping on the bandwagon because it's getting a lot of traction and attention well others are fleeing absolutely how old is overrun with murder and corruption is just such a hell\nAnd it seems no one wants to make ... great again\nThat's sad Hondurans has become this hemisphere is clearing house for cocaine and other drugs and with all that product in money spilling through such a small place for all the magnet the black market draw then in tanks those with money power and this one hung during drug lord and do these ...

more squeezing well connected informants to address the supply end of our nation's along with an deadliest money suck\nAnd well it's good for murder and the bad guys and corrupt than threatened in jail cells and dresses demand in this country now let's pretend that demand will always be here and then we all know drugs are bad and\nIf we dress one side of the equation Russia that will end up with the wrong answer legal marijuana is cutting into the profits of Latin American drug cartels\nAnd with the vast majority of Americans supporting legal cannabis and the next logical step for legalizing the supply for other substances is not too far in the distant future if we want different outcomes in murder rates illegal immigration and hen is here in health we're going to have\nTo

damaging entire societies that constant rent huge an hour and that's the minute\nI that was Lisa Kennedy Montgomery for Fox Business\nHere's my deal in and this was a good question thrown it towards the Univision you own a correspondent last night on Fox News while he was standing there reporting from Mexico is streams and streams and streams of military age males or flowing past him to come break into the United states\nHere's my deal it and she asked the perfect question I think it was more than a cow in last night she says\nHey these these these countries down there need to improve their economies like we get it everybody wants to come to the United states and and now everybody wants all the free stuff but they need to improve their economies down there instead\nThey're just saying I Hope everybody hit off to America\nOf some of the other uh headlines that are coming out of this uh out of it is a migrant caravan as well or is it ... well actually we'll get to those ... said the more the headlines that are coming out of the Caribbean store that I think we've got Dr David Parker back on the phone lines now with a with a better connection or David Ari there\nI think so okay good we got you loud and clear now so ah let's see with a few minutes left here what's what's your major take away from from the polling that came out in the Senate race\nThe matrix where I Would I Would say are are basically three quick points number one\nDemocrats for Jon Tester he's got ... percent support their\nRepublicans have an electron Roseville so this growth potential there eighty three percent are supporting him the second thing is interested in the older voters younger voters goes under forty goes over sixty or supporting faster at the moment\nCritically rows and rows there to basically when you watch the third thing is gender married gender divide basically women are single\nOverwhelmingly protector women that are married\nIf you're married gender divide basically women that are single\nOverwhelmingly protector women that are married even\nRoast they'll pick up some of those votes and in terms of men that are not married about ten point gap there for Jon Tester favoring Jon Tester the final point that thirty nearly thirty quaint lead for Jon Tester among independents\nI'm basically ... when he's got to consolidate Republican base and pull off some of those independents\nNow the timing of the polling talking about that because I understand this may not have captured the full cabinet hearing effect for one and then also the latest Trump rally in Missoula\n[laughter] yeah so we definitely we're in the field during the billings rally\nThe poll with done around September fifteenth and we came out of the field the last survey that was October ...\nAnd that's critically important so we have a little cabin on in the very end so maybe some of the waiter surveys captured that a male poll takes a little longer but we get a higher response

guess and so one make sure they get nine eleven hours of sleep each day to make sure they get sixty minutes of activity preferably outdoor activity\nAnd unlimited screen time to less than two hours doctors got serious St Vincent healthcare in Studio with us here did did I mark all three of those down or all three of those are perfect right exactly what the recommendations are we were talking during the break though about the challenges you know when I when I was a kid in Montana\nI'd go anywhere I mean one time I rode my bike from Glasgow to Nashville just go get some\nYou know potatoes that are ... you know at the gas station in Nashville because they had those big Joe Joes you know what I mean ... ice cream\nI wouldn't no way in the world would allow my kids to do stuff like that I mean you just you feel like you have to keep such a close eye on your kids these days especially in bigger cities like like billings and then we have cold weather on top of that and then the other thing is\nYou know in small towns your kids are more likely to get to be able to play on the football team in the basketball team let's be honest I mean we've only got you know a handful of high schools here in buildings and the likelihood of most kids get to play sports for those who is very low\nYeah we talked about that a little bit I I have four sons you know as a father of four sons who loved to participate in sports obviously I'm very involved in sports in this town [noise]\nAh it is it is amazing what the funnel is there's those kids in her high school and how many kids are playing basketball is fifth and sixth graders and even in seventh and eighth grade on recreational teams or travel teams or even in the middle schools\nAnd then they get to high school and all of a sudden they get funneled down to twelve kids make the freshman team in a school of almost two thousand kids and and so those kids then find alternative activities um many of which are not physical exercise types of activities and so you know I've talked about this I\nI'm a huge fan of more kids in our high schools having the opportunity to play sports even if it's not at the varsity level I don't know why we don't have\nUm more freshmen in JV level teams that give kids the opportunity to grow even in a club team the little league even in little league do you have these kids who are who are great athletes that that really don't grow into their ability until the last year but by then it seems like all star teams have already been selected in those you know those kids miss out on good opportunities so\nI think as a community we need to do a little bit better and giving our kids opportunities that allow them\nTo to meet these criteria that we just talked\nAbout um I ... I saw a story and yes all all even quote CNN here I Do they do a lot of health study so that's why as part of this but it says not exercising is worse for your health and smoking diabetes or heart disease so not acts but now you might say well if you're not exercising you're likely to have all of us to rest of\n'em but anyway I thought that was interesting 'cause I remember our conversation on that topic before you said you'd rather have somebody who is slightly overweight but exercises than somebody who's underweight and not the un doesn't do a physical activity um but that also goes back to diet which we are kind of started off the morning talking about here\nYou saw a recent study about fast food if you think screen time as crazy I'm ... and now I'm I'm On this diet right now and and and loving it and losing a ton of weight film great about it but I'm also real excited when I get the face for the billings last diet where you get a cheap day you know and then I ... I can go cheat and get those old laser\nThe gravy cheese fries yeah yeah yeah stuff like that but\nYou know I give you a cheat day that goes on that day usually default into some of those foods and you feel like garbage on who you're on your feet they it teaches you like a never going to do that ... miserable yeah yeah so\nYeah it's a disagree or talking about is thirty seven percent of adult Americans eat fast food on a daily basis day every day every day\nAnd a and it's really the twenty to forty nine year olds and it's typically lunch\nIt has for obesity are not only that but a lot of times those are parents of children who who see that behavior modeled and then feel that that will that's normal or behavior so I should eat fast food and so instead of taking a lunch to school I'm just going to go across the street when I have my lunch hour and eat whatever fast food restaurants convenient for me\nAll right Aaron Flint here with Montana talks any moment now we should be hearing from Simon Owen with Fox News radio ... apparently to destroy today regarding a this Saudi columnist ... ... s Turkey's president air to one\nIs going to a lay out in detail or the Turkish inquiry into the disappearance of Jamal ...\nOr ... here's my whole whole deal when you think about everything that's going on\nIn Iran I mean I in fact what I needed to do I need to get a hold of our our our uh our friend Dr ... key up from the University of Montana's a the central and south ... south west Asian studies program\nHe's really kind of a kind of the expert on\nCentral and south west Asia\nUm he actually grew up in Iran and then was able to ah to make it a to America um but just ... British guy but I I I I Want to get his take on all of this because to me it's remarkable when you think about\nYou you think about Americans who've been killed overseas you think about Americans have been held hostage overseas which still got Americans being held hostage in Iran right now and and it gets barely if if any media attention in the mainstream media\nThat Americans being held hostage in Iran right now and and it gets barely if if any media attention in the mainstream media I mean ... ... Haq turkey turkey themselves for two years held pastor Brunson in captivity right a house arrest or in prison the guy\nLiterally for two years in and remember isn't it isn't it interesting\nThat that pastor Brunson was released just a few days of ... ... before this whole ... incident and the Turks started\nStarted pushing this story why are the Turks pushing this story could it have anything to do with the fact could could they be biased in any of their investigation or they're in ... I'm not I'm not defending\nThe Saudis hear what the Saudis did there'll be held accountable by the Trump Administration administration um uh you know once this is all said and done so and so it's it's not about that what what I'm saying is is why is this such a major\nNews story I get is intriguing because there's a it sounds like something out of a movie and based on the Turkish line of what happened then they're okay I get that part of it but but but here's the deal when you think about Americans who have been murdered overseas our own Ambassador Chris Stevens drug through the streets half naked\nUh after he had already basically as fix da da da da da da da di terrorists and a ... and ... what was the response by the Obama administration oh an inhaler so that was just because of this film\nIt's just a protest it's because of a movie no it was a radical Islamic terrorist attack on a on our on on our consulate\nAnd and yet that this story just got ... basically just brushed aside just brushed aside by the media they would remember how they defended Hillary when they defended Brock Obama but no it's it's all ... all the time on a lot of the major news networks here that's what I I just don't get about this\nUm and and you know I I just think it's interesting because when you when you think about now for the Fox news does a great job with all these stories but but some of the other major networks I mean remember how wrong\nUm some of the other major mainstream news outlets war when it came to Iran for example I mean uh I ... in fact Dr ... was talking with us about about how they were having these white Wednesdays and it was basically just women protesting\nIn Iran and yet they're being locked up but we still got Americans locked up in Iran but but no it's it's all because she'll be all the time either way or the big news today apparently Turkey's president is detailing\nOr his country's inquiry into the disappearance of journalists are columnist Jamal ... showed me the Saudi columnist for the Washington Post\nNow on the phone lines joining us here on Montana talks Simon Owen with Fox News radio Simon always a pleasure to have you on the show thanks for being with us good morning so what's the latest out of turkey and what's the message from a Turkish president air to one regarding ...\n[noise] yes he is being setting out what he says to key has ... in the three weeks now since ... disappeared there be many off the record unofficial briefings apparently from the ticket medication but today Fred it instead of taking put a lot of that\nAre on the record of it not everything is being reported a but a lot of it he described the death of ... G as Savage mud I actually used the word ... to Fifteen times in a speech he gave it to his column which probably run about twenty minutes so so I think\nHe told lawmakers and I encourage the Turkish investigators believe [noise]\nDid he talked about Saudi officials flying into the country disabling surveillance cameras at the Saudi ... at this happened he said the Stafford given the day off and advance he said that\nThe team of people that train from Saudi Arabia or even had a buddy double amongst them who Walker shrunk jeeze closed\nAfter the attack a parent to make it pay that he had left the ...\nUh in one piece as had been the original Saudi story now they account for him to see that this is a premeditated Savage admitted that contradicts Saudi Arabia's story because it is saying that this journalist died in a brutal\n[noise] what do you think um the Turks is is there a bigger picture story here what do you think a Turkish president air to one has to gain by by basically doing everything he can to to make Saudi Arabia look bad here I I feel like there's a bigger picture from a geopolitical perspective [noise]\nI mean I think you're probably right something there is a ... and a clash of both or a Terry and egos going on ... an an a new one has to be careful because he doesn't have a great banquet himself in terms of tolerating a descent or an ... potentially as a side of this way\nAnd he sees some kind of results if you want to be really cynical about the techie has some financial worries it has significant debt swell maybe the Saudis could conveniently office some low interest loans to keep the countries\nAre books that can get bit healthier than they do at the moment at the same time I'm Dina there is a ... it is a complicated relationship turkey Saudi relations\nIt it may simply be that he doesn't like the approach of the Saudi crown prince as being a huge transformation in Saudi Arabia as leadership in recent years that it is officially still led by king Solomon\nWho is an elderly man to mess an internal debates about just how healthy or otherwise he might pay and now I'm ready knows outside of his inner circle how many strings he's ready putting these days but the de facto leader is the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and he is somebody who has\nA pitched himself as a reliable ally for western governments as somebody who wants to transform Saudi Arabia or into an outward looking Martin and country but there are critics who say that he has a dark side and that being various crimes\nHe'd been accused of in the past and that this was actually just the latest in a line rather than an isolated incident if indeed he is a responsible with ... so\nEdwin may potentially see this as an opportunity to get rid of the crown prince is no too but I think in his speech to parliament today he talked about the king\nSaid I don't doubt the sincerity of king Solomon but in all the time he was talking he didn't mention the crown prince ones and I think some analysts will say that\nThat is an indication that he's sort of not pointing a finger at the crown prince in this case but perhaps waving roughly in in that direction that ... that there is suspicion that the crown prince on the road or this or had knowledge of it in advance\nIt it's interesting to me that this story is getting so much attention so much perspective I mean we had you know Ambassador Stevens drugs through the streets of Benghazi we've in fact even I mean talking about turkey I mean it was the Turks themselves who\nWho were detaining an American pastor for the past two years and it seemed like ... you know is Saudi columnist named ... getting more attention than an American pastor who was held held by the Turks for two years why do you think the story is continuing to get so much attention in and why it seemed like so much of the focus is on just\nHanding the the PR to the to the Turks in this instance [noise]\nLike so much of the focus is on just handing the the PR to the to the Turks innocence\n[noise] while I'm not sure it's about ending to pay out to the to 'cause I mean this is a ... a case where what we're reporting on is the conclusions and the investigations of a number of countries in the U.S is among those the Trump Administration is\nAh the the most important in terms of the the international response an eighties saying that it's not satisfied with the Saturday response so far I the reason this is particularly controversial is because this is a U.S resident writing for a U.S newspaper\nUm who was killed a parent that

country in twenty sixteen there were a lot of people who thought Donald Trump would never\nBecome the president but really I mean I there was these hidden voters out there who were who were quiet but they were back in Trump and they were very concerned about illegal immigration in the border now we've got this caravan approaching the southern border how critical you think this is in the next couple of weeks\nI figured I think I think well what happened is over the last member started I called the number one early in the morning on November night sixteen aggress\nOpposites reporting media the lead to this country have one to nullify the legitimacy of Trump's presidency and and that essentially I use I argued for a while they got to do over on November ...\nThis is a national election which Trump's first reelect it's all on the table right his entire program and to match us up immigration is as national security plan it's the ... economy it's the whole thing it's an up\nOr down vote in the last ... you know Aaron once things the left\nGot Trump much more earlier than the Republican establishment what I mean by that\nThey understand he's a transformative president in a historic figure that Donald Trump's program not just to the courts but also his legislative and executive program\nIs going to be in their lives twenty and Thirty years from now and they're flat out

congressional Republicans was the topic of trade and maybe to a certain extent they still think they can use it as\nAs a bit of a Hail Mary pass here\nUm but but then we just had this major victory with the U.S and Canada would the U.S and Mexico and Trump held firm and they were in and I think the Democrats up and finally an opportunity at least out out here in farm country\nTo use that that issue and against a pro Trump leaning leaning voters but now we've seen degrees on that front and I think I saw you quoted recently saying Trump won't back down\nIn the China Dream or either or do you think he's per hour please do you think he is for another major trade victory\nAnd here's the thing that I think people out there you know in a in your part of the country understand this because they

for\nThe Democrats are going to cut to stop that that is correct and it's a key part of Trump's economic turnaround in this country\nThe Democrats credit card to stop that is correct that if a key part of Trump's economic turnaround his country\nYeah I mean one one I thought was interesting so he was President Trump and he really laid out the case last night in Texas said that incredible turnout rally alongside Senator Ted Cruz he really laid out just how much\nI mean he talked about how how strong the American economy is right now you talked about it the three four percent GDP Growth we've seen it in Montana huge revenues in the state capital of Helena\nAnd um but then it but then on the flip side he talked about how China is hurting now because they've decided to to fight this
