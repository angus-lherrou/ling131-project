and winning breaks there's this long talks with Aaron for Fox News talk thirty five point five [laughter]\nYeah so this is just some initial reaction wasn't planning on an chatting about this but to great great to get sounds from going to go back to time here too but basically is what happens is the the trial lawyers the left leaning trial lawyers serves their money behind specific candidates I daresay they actually go out and and hand pick and then recruit some of these judicial candidates\nThan they served their initial batch of money behind that Kennedy\nAnd then the rest of the lawyers that are out there that are either independent or a political or maybe even conservative\nAre left thinking God I don't want that Kennedy to be elected by\nYou know if I you know support the opponent or put money out there that now I might be appearing before a judge that's going to be hostile to me simply because I supported their opponent and and the idea that these that these judicial races or nonpartisan\nThey're supposed to be nonpartisan but we all know that that's pretty much a joke that you end up having probably a liberal candidate and then either an apolitical or a center or a a conservative a leading candidate\nOr so but anyway it just it gets to be a challenge that's for sure but anyway back to Tom tom you still there\nIf I Am yeah is it is frustrating with the judicial elections isn't it\nOh yeah and then it just seems to everything complicates itself it seems to start intertwining and as you explain it's a mess you got deeper into it than I thought\nWell and sometimes you know if you get to know certain lawyers around town and ... you know liberal conservative a political ones too and\nYou know they'll they'll tell you that hey you got to know about this about this judge or hey you got to know this about this candidate or that candidate\nBut they can't say it publicly um and and maybe some of the lawyers listen to the show the kind of weigh in here but but but because of uh uh because of I don't know if it's because of the bar\nEt cetera but they're they're not allowed to ever really criticize a sitting judge a really publicly I mean they can they get crafty with the way they criticize decisions but they're not allowed to criticize a judge so\nThe rest of us voters out here you know we don't know you know we don't get the expert opinion from a lot of the attorneys on these judges\nAnd and their records on the bench when they get up for the Supreme Court or something because the very people who could give us the best insights which are the lawyers that it will appear before them\nReally aren't allowed to freely speak and and then you've got the trailers lobby that that basically just just plays political games I think with a lot of this stuff too so yeah it's a it's a mess\nWell thank you for that feedback and thank you for taking my call this for you\nKnow well thank you John great to hear from me appreciate you jumping on the conversation yet to nine four zero nine Seventy is the phone number on a river a cabinet company phone lines I think we've got Sloan back on the phone lines here cell phone signals that are breaking up a little bit earlier Sloan Ari there\nAren't there and now I'm On a landline probably shouldn't have too much of a probably a good there we go what I what I wanted to talk\nAbout a black hole then why is that I used to be a Democrat in my family a lot of Democrats came from you know ... years and years of feeding Democrat\n[noise] um than it had to change I started\nTo to look more problems than probably never changed in the last ten years\nChange they're always there and and that while the Democrats say they have the solution they don't\nAnd that's why I can vote for them anymore because um they the funding mechanism to them or for the funding mechanism for ... for Democrats candidates changed and their organization the media's cooperation\nAnd pressure on corporations all changed to favored democratic candidates they don't represent the people who put them in office anymore they represent the party and that's my big problem\nAnd and do we keep if we let it go on and vote for Democrats were going to be the dispossessed majority in our own country not just your ... you're not just your assets are your well your liberties will be gone and your rights will be gone and that's why I Can't vote for them anymore and the one good thing about\nMr Trump is not eloquent that's for sure but when it came to things I'm solving problems he did but he can solve problems we weren't aware of for example give you an example on NAFTA I I kind of knew from people talking for years it wasn't a great deal but I didn't know how bad the deal was\nAnd when he did this we organization of\nNAFTA um there were things going on that were like for example China was sending products to to Mexico and and in Mexico they'd slap on a U.S labels and made in Mexico so it would go bypass\nAnd get into the U.S with you know little tariffs\nWell with this new deal all it in Canada they didn't want to join but Kennedy did join but all sales from China now come through through the U.S first which is fantastic because there's things are going on like Bloomberg put out a I'm a article the other day it's called the big hack\nThe bay kept H. A. C. K. China has been um [noise] involved in a lot of um surveillance in our computers affects our Pentagon facts that the department of defense affects everybody's computer so we didn't even know about that it's a big article and I guess\nMaybe that has on the on the market I think the Drudge Report linked to that one too yeah yeah the White House right I'm a woman was going on him and now ... on that did they get apple hey well well well that's not really what happened but the way I\nRead that yeah they did push back at all of that happened to two thousand Fifteen under under mounted and nobody knew about it until now but by reorganizing NAFTA one everything's coming to the U.S first to they're going to deal with these problems of all the computers in the high tech having a chip in it and nobody knew they had\nAnd uh yeah we need to look\nTowards Mr Trump supporting him so Mr tester he may be a nice guy but we're not looking for nice guys were looking for people who are going to solve problems that help us help the American people\nAnd I don't even I Would have been pushed back I think there's some people who bought into this nice guy image\nThat his cheerleaders in the media tried to portray\nThat's one of the show every picture of and they always show the guys from the United states senator for twelve years every picture that the media shows and you'll notice shows him on a tractor with the with a with a ... jacket on\nAnd they do that deliberately to try to help them to try to prop him up to try to make it look like something that he is not they don't show him and the tuxedo that he's wearing back in Washington and you try to make them in organic\nMontana and not and um you're right about the lawyers and the ADA there in cahoots with them they took constantly

yeah\nOkay I'm calling so that after the fashion dash there is a movie in billings called the Kermit God Nell story the biggest serial killer in the world trial of the biggest serial killer in the world\nMy husband and I went to that last night it's on through the weekend and what a movie that is it's about hermit gods now the abortion doctor in Philadelphia yeah uh and that was such a creepy subject this is a pretty good horror movie but it isn't\nOverly done we were just so impressed\nWe were curious in a morbid way about it and we're very pro life and so we're we're wondering if it would be a good tool ah you know over ... activists and actually they don't\nThey're very careful about that\nBut this was a very informative\nFactual movie that wasn't too dramatic it wasn't too gross but it is just a great movie to inform people about what's going on in the abortion industry and I just wanted to encourage people to go see it it there through the weekend I think and Monday\nSo we had to answer you don't shy away the one on Shiloh yeah because I was wondering is so the shallow one definitely has a one off the check and see if they're showing it like it the other one was about the mall and maybe I only oh okay I I heard\nThat they were and I also think it's throughout Montana so um you know it'll be in the other other cities I think it's in both in Missoula anyway but it's a it's a good ... going to see it it's a good movie we were impressed\nI saw actually I saw the daily signal which is a a kind of a blog for the Heritage Foundation of they've done some reviews on it as well\nDo I didn't realize they were going to be accepted that film was I knew that there was this guy's now documentary that's been out I Need to see it but I didn't know it was actually going to be showing in theaters here in Montana so I appreciate you giving everybody the heads up about that\nYeah it was that difficult or they can make because they couldn't get any funding for it of course but it was pretty much funded by people small donations people just wanting that story out and it is appropriate for teenagers very appropriate\nYeah in a pot the media will want to share that story much because uh you know the right\nThe the they're usually more uh tools of the abortion industry rather than um advocates for for you know not that they need to be advocates they need to be a journalist but still they'll they will constantly tell stories that seem to be skewed one one direction so would that there's no one or they're not prominently\nTelling folks about this guy's Nell movies any thank you so much for getting the word out on that actually being in theaters here in Montana great to hear from you\nAll right uh well on our phone lines right now congressman Greg ... joining us great great to have is always\nAaron good to be with you\nYeah are you back in Capitol Hill or do you make it home to Bozeman\nNo I'm here in Bozeman today and the beautiful state of Montana\nAll right good to hear good ear while I was I was going to ask you you know uh apparently President Trump is going to be back in Montana next Thursday in Missoula and I know you've kind of been logging the frequent flyer miles on air force one so that has has the visit been officially released or anything like that yeah is there anything you can tell us well I\nCan get for and he'll be here on the Eighteenth\nNext week in Missoula it'll be an evening rally or and I just I just want to say I am so proud\nTo be working with President Trump a this administration you know the the\nThe economy now is over four percent GDP Growth unemployment is at record lows\nThe prior administration said that we two percent was the new normal well President Trump being a business guy said hey we can do better than that and we are at America's when and again\nYou had these economic numbers are incredible I remember when we first first chatted with you here in our studios oh maybe back in I don't know if it was January February\nAnd you know and we talked about him because we can already see some of the great economic news we we we can already see the indicators that there was a Trump bump that was having positive affects not only on private sector revenues but also on a public sector or did you know revenues here in Montana\nThat but but the one concern that folks had and I know it was a concern that you are you know that you had shared as well there was a concern about about trade and the concern about trade and the impact to agriculture but yet here in the last couple of weeks\nWe just got very great news when it comes to trade with Canada and Mexico something that President Trump's critics were saying was never going to happen\nYeah he's been making great progress I mean it's not just Canada and Mexico is now signed an agreement with South Korea Europe has said they're coming on board with you know zero tariffs both ways this and that and I don't think people\nFully understand how fundamental disagreement with Canada and Mexico is if it's a this is a win for the minister I should\nI went to ambassador Lighthizer and pointed out some of the inequalities in trade we figure that Canadians as our friends to the north of there are we love their beer but they haven't been very good trade partners\nUm do you know grain growers here in Montana ship ingrained into Canada at the border it gets graded as feed quality no matter what quality it is they downgraded feed quality\nI raised this issue with ambassador Lighthizer he said it was one of two hundred and Seventy non tariff trade issues we had with Canada alone\nThat is fixed and this new agreement now grain from ... a month\nAt the border they have to grade at the same way they grade they're domestic grain inside cat\nYeah in fact I was in great falls or just after this announcement about all I think the week after this was announced and so ended up getting to chat with ... and she she ... they had very positive reaction from Montana green growers about this in fact I I kind of joke where the candidate had been doing was\nYou know we were sending them a Cadillac which is you know Montana and rain we're sending in the best which you know we were sending them a Cadillac and\nAnd they were calling it a pinto and and that's not change things President Trump and and and the Republican Congress let's let's look at me and remind the Republican Congress has supported President Trump in in strengthening these trade agreements\nWe also got a winner and for our stock grow because again Canada was not a very good trading partner we shipped cows were cast to Canada\nCanada was insisting on ... ... signatures on the veterinary certificates\nAnd what that did was it caused it today to lay at the border while the cows or the cat got sick lost weight it just wasn't a fair trade practice in this new agreement it encourages the use of digital signatures which we can turn things around a lot faster that's going to be mean higher prices for among kind of stock ...\nYeah that's that's key yeah heard positive reaction than the national ... beef association about that trade agreement is well what do you think the next on the train from\nI think that we're going to get an agreement with Japan uh this is just one guy talking but the\nTrump administration's been very clear that we have a deal breaker chief he\nSaid he was going to get us better deals and he is and instead of trying to do these multilateral agreements where you get everybody around and you\nYou try and find some consensus he's if he's not gonna down one of the time getting better deals for America so we have access to foreign markets I think China is the most recalcitrant but they're going to become more and more isolated as we get deals with all the other countries\nWill end in since we're already talking trade which of course brings up Montanans number one industry which is agriculture what about the farm bill I Know that's one thing it's at when I was talking with ... from the grain growers and they're thinking maybe before the end of the year they might get it done but not before the election [noise] um well looking back on the farm bill from\nYeah that's my hope as well but we get it done by the end of the year I spoke with chairman Conaway the house or a chairman of the Agriculture Committee just before we broke and Washington\nOn the house for I just after what the status as he's on a conference committee doing the work and it really is\nVery little contention about the farm provisions we need crop insurance everybody agrees on that the good news I got from him was that all this crop here is fully underwritten there's no nothing's going to expire anytime soon um but we need to get this crop\nInsurance in place by the end of the year to get ready for the next crop here the contention has to do with the food stamps which has been\nNow ... eighty percent of the funding and the farm bill is is directed the food stamp some of this prior administrators and we went from twenty seven million people on food stamps over forty million people in the U.S and these are not\nSingle moms with kids these are not people with disabilities these are not seniors these are able bodied adults who have chosen not to work\nThe house has been insisting that we um\nIf you can work they should work\nIf you can't work but are able we ought to get you in training so you can get some skills you can work and uh some reason the Democrats in the Senate don't like that idea um both so we'll keep pushing\nAll we need to take care of farmers\nOn another front um you know in the high tech front or not even just high tech really on the entrepreneur front which you've you've

the rally\nThat we have all been waiting for isn't it I mean I get it you you want Donald Trump to go to your town you want him in Kalispell you want him in Glen died you want them in ... point is you know he's already been to ... you know and then when he went to billings that was great when he went to great falls that was great\nBut this is going to be exciting I mean isn't this going to be just

Montana isn't it here [noise] ah I just love it this is going to be great uh well we can now confirmed that President Trump\nWill be here in Montana or at least according to the plans I mean plants and always change but we can confirmed that he is planning a rally in Missoula um I actually just got off the phone with congressman Greg gene for tape and he says it's going to be an evening rally on the Eighteenth\nSo I I heard from a and other Republican source yesterday the yes President Trump was planning a visit to Missoula and they teach 'em but that's all we pretty much knew that's all pretty much everybody else has reported\nUm but I did just hear from congressman gene forwarded that it will be a evening rally on the Eighteenth so you've got some ... some time to drive across the state to all of that morning to make it over there although I Would tell you to get you might want to get the Missoula the night before\nSo that you can be out there bright eyed bushy tailed the morning of the event plus then you get to see all the crazy protesters right I mean that's going to I mean half the draws getting to see President Trump in Missoula the other half is getting to see the cast of characters that come out to protest isn't it really\nAh ... what was funny so I'm getting some some good good discussion on this on my Facebook page Facebook dot com slash flip\nAnd and you get some good discussion and somebody says well why why is he going to Missoula is you just go in there just to stick it to the liberals and just to\nStick to the communist or the Democrat socialist there uh I mean that's going to be the fun part dome Iran but no I I think it's much more than that I think I think by choosing Missoula I think not only then are you able to draw in all of those\nUh conservatives or Trump you know independence union voters others et cetera who who liked Donald Trump\nAnd his agenda you draw all of the folks from the ... valley and they come up from Hamilton Stevens ... cetera\nBut then on top of that it's ... relatively short drive for everybody coming down from the flat and very strongly conservative Flathead valley of Montana too so you ... you take two GOP strongholds draw them in but then on top of that I I think this is a story that is not often told\nThe fact is look up are conservatives the majority in Missoula proper no but there are a lot of them remember Missoula is one of Montana's largest cities\nAnd so they may only be you know what the Trump voter formally thirty seven percent of the vote in Missoula for Trump right okay and and and Republicans can get a little bit more votes than that in in some other elections or the percentage wise\nYou this morning I think you'll find there's even more Trump fans and be that

Pam good to hear from you what's on your mind is more\nThey can get to the good to talk to going thank you I was just going to bring 'em and it kind of falls in line with what you're talking about the six ...\nAnd I know that the conservatives in some of the conservatives anyway and feeling\nAre opposing that and I know that the the ads mentioned it's a forty eight year tradition in Montana it helped funding tuition for students and the reason\nIt's one there's no accountability\nYou do not see the money or where it goes how it is then or the board of regents are basically markers and a full life ... if you will\nAnd as\nFar as I can see the only conservative we have um there is a healthy and she is the next official member of that as a board\nAnd is seeking with some of the legislators they're saying hey we just ah you know the work that out of budget we approve it Missoula has a major fundraising campaign right now\nUm we look at the liberal studies that they're doing and cutting out\nThey don't appreciate conservative speakers so we're just kind of go on words the math and science so just would like to hear your take on the ...\nWell that's you know that's a good question because uh you know I can see both sides of this issue um but it's a it's a good question you raised the that OK well whether you support or oppose the ... 'cause you could say this I think supporters of the ... for the higher education system would say hey look\nThis is this is a property tax limit this is a ... that people are already paying so it won't raise taxes this is just a procedural vote in the November elections to pass the six mil\nLevy so it doesn't raise your taxes you're already paying these taxes okay got that in in in\nYou know some might use some even off right might be concerned that well if we do away if the voters don't approve the six ... will will then the legislature or others try to go in and take more of our taxes through other means because they ...\nThey lost that money but I I Do think whether you support or oppose the ...\nI think there's a lot of questions about our university system right now um I mean the fact that the you're right when when it conservative professor from North Carolina who is slated to be the annual coal lecture series lecture at the University of Montana school of journalism but then the the liberal dean at the time says well no I'm not going to\nAllow that to happen under the school of journalism better but they'll they'll allow a liberal to come in and talk because they are from NPR and they talk all in a nasal even with their National Public radio hosts but oh you're a conservative no you're not allowed on our college campus well do you want our money or not you know\nThey didn't want the Koch brothers money and it makes yeah you're right yeah yeah yeah yeah you had a ... I\nCongressman and then what was the news yesterday that I share with you the news a Fox News dot com was reporting and this was Bret Baer an Adam shah who reporting this that uh that interior secretary Ryan Zinke he\nMet with the president on a Wednesday and in his one of five contenders to be the next UN ambassador at the United nations succeeding a a Nikki Haley the very popular you an investor Nikki Haley\nWho's who said that she's going to be done at the end of the year so I said that yesterday that you know what I think he's one of five names apparently we haven't heard to all the other names are but we heard that there were five names but but what everybody else was reporting was that the top contender for the UN ambassador gig\nWas Dina Powell the former deputy national security advisor in the Trump White house so we were hearing the dean of powers while she's the topic and everything like that [noise]\nUh and so will now Dina Powell is out a Reuters has reported\nOn Thursday that she withdrew her name from consideration she wants to stay at Goldman Sachs she wants to stay close to your kids politicos platelets also reporting that earlier this morning\nHere is well so is that an even bigger assigned the zinc he could be the UN ambassador I don't know there there's some other names that are floating out there as well and of course there's folks in the administration who\nWho want to see another woman appointed to the same position um\nYou know 'cause they focused on gender so this thing and that's what it comes down to it either way Dina Powell is out so\nA lot to talk about this morning Iran Montana talks phone lines are open for you for all six to nine four zero nine Seventy let's go to Tammany Hall our friends family home on the phone lines now Tammy get great great to hear from you\nHey Erin I guess it's an honor to be with you down in the beautiful accountability\nLet me get mad at you oh yeah ... ... got hired off you are going to be okay I mean he is going to be happy to be dealing\nWith real found that climate is part of it respects worker [laughter] acknowledge the whole point of it is not to bring in more and more people from California\nFor him call yourself fancy town\n'cause he parted ways so Christmas for\nThose in the states so Chris ... used to be the the city administrator in in ... bell and then he got picked up by both of them was there for over ... over a dozen years ... parted ways I'm ... and now he just got hired I don't know if he's except for the ... but to be the buildings that administration but yesterday some folks ... wondering like\nHey what's this guy's a pro now he\nIs absolutely great them I think the final ... oldest one was that they wanted to become a sanctuary city because ... when we call it goes Angeles I've lived there fifty years but\nUm we call it goes Angeles 'cause it's changed so much wouldn't know what my son likes to say if you drive ten miles any direction I mean you'll find Montana [noise]\nUm I think senator dean stole that joke for him to I think I've heard him very\nThrough so um and it's true and sadly too but anyway how does that say rose went on to become a sanctuary city and they and he brought them the facts that he should as a city manager he had the\nPeople come in representing law enforcement and explain what a complicated mess this would be for any city and where we'll put you in a bind\nAnd they would not helping the people you want it to help and uh so they when they were faced with the problems of the reality of law enforcement they had to back down from it and I don't think they appreciate him bringing them this facts\nOh well now that's a good ... to know yeah he's\nVery very fair a very good he takes his job seriously and they're just good him and his wife and it and in daughters I'm telling you they're just good Christian people who are going to be an advantage to your city that's\nThat's all I tell you very lucky speaking of sanctuary cities\nI saw that that issue came up in the the U.S House race debate last weekend I I didn't get a chance to watch the whole debate in between flag football and soccer games and everything else going on I missed it unfortunately but I in some of the press covered I read that the topic of sanctuary cities came up because there was a vote in the state legislature to ban sanctuary cities in Montana\nAnd of course Bolivia vetoed it\nUm but I saw that it came up because apparently Kathleen Williams voted against a ban on sanctuary cities in Montana and her response was well well nobody's trying to make a sanctuary city in Montana and I was like he did\nVote against it and I'm against banning it um if you have to be very careful with Kathleen Williams she's college professor and she very effectively skirt the issue is um she's trying to send that it's okay to be with the uh not approved by the end All right but it's important I can just give you one fact and this is a packed\nPacked out of her own mouth and that is during her legislators time she was raised in an effort by the n._r._a. and I have a speech before liberal she said it's my most proud of his\nRating it stands for fearless cause I stood up to the in our in our ways well I'm so now she's trying to say well I carry guns sometimes and I found it once and I I don't know if there's any record for hunting but um it's just really important to go back to a person who really support the n._r._a. doesn't say they take\nThat they they embrace their their ass as fearless I that's just that's a I think she does believe that she has a right to believe that she just doesn't have a right to pretend that at a different time and place she did not say that it does it still mean\nYeah I thought she heard her brand to and the coverage that I saw because she was basically saying you know she was basically trying to defend her record because she's getting attacked for being anti gun she's being attacked for for her ass from the you know from the n._r._a. and everything like that and now she's getting defensive\nHe's getting attacked for being anti gun gee being attacked for\nFor her ass from the you know from the n._r._a. and everything like that and now she's getting defensive over and say well actually I I support guns and I support Second Amendment rights just like what happened to the fear lists I I don't care if I get an F from the rain in Iran you're like oh well that's not fair I think she only hurt her brain\nTo me in the most um ironic part of that entire race and I don't know if\nYou're beeping or I'm beating but I'm Sorry about that I might have a lot I'm sixty nine so\nAnyway I think\nThat is the most ironic part of that entire race is that for the Everytime grades has run for anything is he's the how the state guy he doesn't live in Montana and they worry on that rage and that and of course we've known them since they moved to both men and their their youngest daughter who's now graduated from Stanford\nWas born in Bozeman so that tells you how long they lived\nHere um and they are as much as people as over half the states that doesn't have roots right in the states but now that's\nNot an issue because Kathleen Williams moved here from Berkeley\nSan Francisco California ... you don't hear anything about the\nBerkeley are taught at Berkeley she's got Merkley connections and as you know so it's just perfectly fine and we're not going to touch that issue now that are Kennedy has not been in the state very long and came from Berkeley hey I wanted to share the chew uplifting things\nIf you if you have a minute I'm normally when we always like good news to we don't we never had enough of that\nLast night in Bozeman we had a wonderful speaker for so we care the pro life um banquets at one time of year banquet we had and they packed the room to as many as they absolutely could hold four hundred over four hundred and twenty five people for dinner it was\nAn absolute delight and it was an absolutely strong\nFired up crowd who realizes that people now who are pro life are winning were winning the hearts of America were winning the politics of America were winning for babies and we're waiting for\nMoms and dads and families as sisters and brothers and grandmothers and grandfathers\nAnd young people according to polling on young people\nAnd ten years ago there were over two thousand abortion clinics and fewer than five hundred\nUm ... you know groups like Zoe and and ... and trying to trying to show the other side that women do have a choice in life is a beautiful thing and those numbers are totally reverse Sarah fewer than five hundred abortion clinics now in America and um and we have over two thousand groups\nThat are fighting for and the other thing that has changed desperately and wonderfully is the sonograms because what they found and you'll find this interesting Ninety percent of perspective dads who go in and see their baby on a sonogram want to keep the baby alive\nIs pretty remarkable what ... is pretty remarkable what did you see it yeah well see\nBecause when I was in college they told us right here rocky when I was going to college you know they said dumb it's just a blob of cells and you can't tell the difference in the uterus from a baby or a dog it's six months they look identical just a big blobs and\nWe believe that because he believed everything in college I mean why would they tell us the truth\nAnd measures don't have an agenda at All right we're paying\nSo much money for them and they look so smart and oh I Hope they get paid so well and uh but we believe that at all and then it is I think the reality is a sonogram has just helped people see that picture\nIn the advancements of medical training the fact that doctors are now treating babies and\nSonic Graham has just helped people see that picture puzzle\nAnd now the advancements of medical treatment in the fact that doctors are now treating babies inside the womb for pain when they're doing three hands on women well why do you think they're treating for pain it could be as the baby is feeling something so the medical advancements have shed so much more light on it too and", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "12"}
