they were not going to be a Supreme Court ...

simply followed their tradition in America\nThough I wasn't trying to persuade Senator Flake or others are not to vote their conscience not to reflect their states and their values and advancing a conservative judge I was trying to help them focused on what legitimate questions there were about this particular conservative judge\nWe have a print them and then on the Internet and send the country and when I look at the lack of any corroborating evidence I couldn't I concluded that Brett Kavanaugh ones her assailant\nCard there you go that's your Fox News radio morning montage for you I thought it was interesting that the some of my liberal friends you know on social media on friday when it became pretty apparent that Susan Collins was going to be supporting a judge or justice cabinet when it also became pretty apparent that uh Joe Manchin the Democratic to West Virginia was going to be supporting\nJustice Kavanaugh's confirmation yeah my liberal friends or devastated just depressed and of course angry but they're always angry are hard to say there are always angry but anyway what I thought was interesting was that the reaction from them from my liberal friends as I watch the news that I'm not even I'm just turning it all off\nThey're they're they're depressed there whatever whatever motivation they had a completely sank\nAnd it reminded me remember back in twenty twelve a when Mitt Romney was was up at and a lot of uh stop Mitt Romney was actually going to win against a rock Obama for his reelection back in twenty twelve\nAnd and remember when Roberts the Bush appointee who voted in support of Obamacare in rule that rule the constitutional which was a complete travesty\nRemember the impact that I think that had on the twenty until the elections it depress the conservative vote because they thought well what the heck we even if we win\nWhen do we ever when it seems like even if we win elections we we lose on the on the big issues because because our people our we have our appointees always cave and get bullied and cable or the other side's a what's the point anymore so I really think that that had a major impact on the twenty twelve election between Romney\nAnd for Iraq Obama but anyway I I I won't I Wonder if if this is the fact that the Democrats did all the despicable tactics they could to try to stop capping off and they failed I Wonder if that'll depress the Democrat vote the this uh this uh mid mid term election it'll be interesting to see are a\nCouple of more Associated Press news headlines for here before we get to the

fireplace and above it is this a great kind of steel cast I guess you would call it of a of a moose hanging over over top of the the fireplace\nHere and so I just at a level that I read this story for the Daily Caller and uh and it's\nAbout what what Mitch McConnell was saying the President Trump's you know the President Trump is calling Mitch McConnell's and Mr you gonna get the job done on Capitol or what here basically it was I imagine how the phone he probably has more choice words and I'm using on the radio right now\nAnd this was according to the New York times uh he he finally said what did he say to President Trump here I Want to get the exact quote for you okay so Trump asked McConnell at one point it Senate Republicans were committed the seeing justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation through to the end\nOr this was according to interviews with senators and White House officials McConnell replied quote I'm stronger than mule piss on Kavanaugh [laughter]\nThat's the I'm stronger than meal test that's what he told the Donald Trump about how yes I Will get the job done here are jumping on the phone lines here we've got Jonathan magnificent Yellowstone county news on the phone line Jonathan get to hear from you what's on your mind this\nMay vary they're taking my call hey I just wanted to add to what you're talking about and talking about Mitch McConnell in regard to I don't know if you remember back in about three thousand Thirteen\nWhen Harry Reid changed the rules in the Senate to from basically took away the filibuster often from sixty one vote and he took it to what fifty one so that they kind of pushed through their own nominees but what Mitch McConnell said back then if I'm not mistaken\nIt was like you told him he told Mitt McConnell called airy read you're going to regret that sooner than you think\nYeah and now look what's happened now we have a whole new administration and what Harry Reid was pushing through at the time now I Hope he's regret not\nWell yeah I saw some of the Republicans were telling the protesters say you don't like it go go thank Harry Reid 'cause he's he's the reason why\nYou know fifty one votes but but I was also listen to it on Fox News Sunday over the weekend and I are actually I think it was on meet the press I think it was Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and he was point now look most almost every single Supreme Court justice that's been confirmed in history [noise]\nThe only really needed fifty one votes so they've they've been playing games with this fall along yeah\nWell I just think it's so funny because Harry Reid\nBack in the day even when I mean he'll just throw stuff out there just to push whatever you want it's given back when you're when about Mitt Romney and saying there is not paying taxes and all that what you think\nUh worked in the later on and then now you haven't pushed to stop the change of trying to rule you know change the rules and I just hope he's regret and a lot of things that he does\n[laughter] I I don't know if this ... you have any regrets I [laughter]\n\nAnyhow I'll let you go on I just thought I'd bring that up just an ad [noise] what are we made the

chatting with her here on the show but first up we've got a we've got to Evelyn ... with the big sky Business Journal back in Studio Evelyn thanks again for holding down the Fort forests back there\nUh you've got another piece of the big got Business Journal about a a local inventor developed a new technology that recognizes the sound of a gunshot\nAnd can immediately notified first responders within seconds telling them exactly where the shots came from so that's that's kind of interesting because ah yeah I mean I remember ... you know kind of demo ing similar technology over in Afghanistan but but the real interesting middle local inventor is up ... is is doing this\nYes I'm Alan overcast and he has been working for a number of years on developing\nThe technology that can accurately identified the sound of a gunshot and apparently that was a tough thing to do um [noise] but now than he has a system that can be installed anywhere\nAnd ... monitors for the sound of a gunshot and the minute or a gun goes off it within seconds\nI'm is notifying first responders or whoever it is a program to notify and so instead of having um\nResponders and medical team showing up you know\nEight nine ten maybe Fifteen minutes later they can be on the way within seconds\nAnd um and and the technology identifies exactly which room or you know I mean which building a while or whatever or which room it came from\nSo there's none of the second guessing that\nI'm police or a others have to do to try to figure out where shooter might be or or where something might be happening and um it just is time saving and increases the chances of stopping a perpetrator and and saving lives and\nSafety for first responders as well so they know hey actually the guys behind you or have make sure you know that that can be a huge yeah um and then a couple of minutes left here before we get our Fox News break apparently you're tracking something that maybe it could be an issue in the next to legislative session ... what's this recent article out of the Montana business quarterly\nWell yes I I don't honestly know what's being proposed or anything but it's been my observation over time and if you see some of these issues raised prior to the state legislature sometimes that's you know anticipating an issue that's going to come up and so they're talking about um\nThe ... what they perceived to be a need for the state doing something to increase um for the family leave act\nOr not an act but but to increase um [noise]\nThe um you know a benefits available to workers who

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nHard here we are just moments after the successful confirmation vote this was supposed to be\nA rally in support of judge Brett Kavanaugh but very quickly became a victory celebration Matt Rosendale first off your immediate reaction just moments after the confirmation vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh I tell you it was very very of um fulfilling to see that\nOr the confirmation vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh I'll tell you it it was very very um um\nFulfilling to see that the United States Senate had the courage to stand up there and take those very there was disturbances going up in the gallery I was listening to it as I was driving up the highway there was a servants has taken place I'm up in the gallery to try and and again to delay this process and the United States Senate\nStood there and courageously took those votes and I'd also thrilled quite frankly that center Steve Gaines who I Know wanted to be there and place that vote was able to walk his daughter down the aisle today and still and still see that confirmation take life\nHe did say both things were going to happen so it's productions came through what do you think that says about President Trump in the Republican Party 'cause I I'm hearing from a lot of conservatives and other and you know and and independents moderates who wanted to see this confirmation go through as well but but they're all saying I Can't I Can't believe that the Republicans are actually winning\nUsually they have they can't take the pressure what what do you think this says about the Republican Party in ...\nI Will tell you that it generates and enthusiasm and energy across the nation because I've seen it across to stay there and I mean when we go to towns now from\nFrom round up and wide hole in Columbus and there's fifty\nPeople cheering crowds standing there when when they start thinking about the potential for success that we still are on the verge of I mean you well know GDP is coming in over four percent ... and we just see that as the beginning and they are really\nReally enthusiastic and thrilled that the Republican Party is galvanized and and it's not just the Republican Party we do have the independence now coming out and saying we're\nReally thrilled to see\nThat the the change has come and they are they're supporting us overwhelmingly\nOn a question I Know you've got to hit the road here but uh we we've seen the news out of North Dakota there was pulling that showed a dramatic turn turn or\nDownturn for Heidi Heitkamp the come a Democrat over there down ten points in polling now the interests the U.S pulled their ad they're starting to pull back and some of their advertising over there obviously that's a neighboring state are you seeing a similar impact here in Montana and\nThere is an enormous red wave it's going across the nation right now people are not going to tolerate the politics of personal destruction any longer\nAs I said earlier this this last for power that the Democratic party has demonstrated and and and people see it they recognize that from what it is and\nThey want to support the success\nPresident Trump is is bringing to our nation\nWell given all these protests that are going on on some of the antics I Know there was some craziness and the Missoula offices or friday hope to you and all the candidates out there or stay safe out there is this because who knows if people are just getting crazy out there a final day\nThey are they are and I tell everybody all the time never put yourself in harm's way that it that job number one and that's why it continually\nEvery single venue that we go to I take the time to go around to all of the security folks that are participating 'cause a lot of them are volunteers as you well know and and thank them for looking out for us because we really do need it right now\nAll right Matt great to see thanks their\nHard earned here with Montana talks yeah that was our conversation with Matt Rosendale on Saturday afternoon also I ran into Deborah land the chair of the Montana Republican Party or at that rally is well\nEndeavor thanks again for being with us here for a live show from paradise valley good to see it and\nWe we heard that update during our news breaking chocolate mad a little bit about it also but what about these antics of the Democrats socialist protesters basically staging a sit in an occupying your Missoula GOP offices apparently there's that they want to do even more on\nWell he's staging a sit in an occupy your Missoula GOP offices apparently there's that they want to do even more on top of that\nYou know we see this across the nation but now we're seeing it here in Montana the amount of money pouring in like\nFrom Thoreau and these other groups is just phenomenal you know\nJon Tester and Kathleen William are part of that liberal Democrat side of the party and I think the fact that that's happening and\nWe actually had these people come in and sit in in our offices disrupted our work from it stopped us from doing our elections activity and they were on top of the roof I mean it was just incredible and their attorney has even indicated that they're more plans for these around the state so\nYeah it's a ... I saw it and apparently I I Need to track down some audio from that event but from what I Need to track down audio from that have been but apparently what what I was hearing was that it was just crazy audio crazy ethics bodies buddies protestors but this just shows I think\nThis isn't exactly what they were doing in the United states that\nThey just want to shut everything down they want to block progress it's really quite symbolic of what of what the left has been doing the across the board with Democrat Senator Jon Tester him into and across the board\nYeah absolutely and you know we have to stand up and I am so grateful that we had a president and Senate that stood for\nA Kavanaugh and his appointment because if we let the police can put\nIt's yeah I mean there is yeah this is\nAn war for the soul of our country are we going to be a socialist country or are we going to be the America that we all grew up with with our constitutional republic\nHow much do you think things are changing so North Dakota I reported last week the political was saying how the the national Republican Senatorial Committee\nIs already pulling back some of their scheduled advise in the north Dakota Senate race because they're what they're saying is that hey Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is toast\nBecause of the fact that that she voted now she voted against a judge Breyer justice Brett Kavanaugh will sort of John Chester I've got to think there's similar impacts happening here in Montana now also or maybe some of that ad money will shift towards Montana to help with the heat on Chester too\nWell there's no doubt that we've seen a major shift I'm with Chester bowling I mean he's down mad is up um people are people are tired of it they are outraged at what the Democrat Party has turned into and\nTo have people from the Democrat Party actually call us and say that they are fed up and what happened to capping off was just unforgivable they're actually voting Republican in this cycle so that's extremely encouraging in a major shift\nYou know and it's funny you can't get any of them to say it on the record or they won't call on the radio but it's what they are all think it will not the wrong thing and it's what it's what a sizeable chunk of the Democratic party or at least democratic voters are just saying wildly these guys have gone off the\nDeep end these ... these democratic candidates I mean it it it it's just crazy to like you think about it it's like\nYou know I think Max Baucus would have played things a lot smarter than John tester has been planned things but maybe it's just because of the end of the day John Chesser is just so liberal he is he died in the wool liberal\nYou know absolutely and I mean going back to his attacks I mean just faceless attacks against Ronny Jackson I mean how absurd was that um you know he he will go to no end to win and it's all about winning and power and forget principles\nNo end to win and it's all about winning and power and forget principles\nWe just people are tired of it\nYeah it's yeah fat asshole instruction has resistance to the president\nI think I saw there was a surprise drop it in Hamilton and the bitter it over the weekend that the Donald Trump junior ... surprise appearance and Hamilton over the weekend I saw him at Rosendale a Facebook page also what do you think you think we get the big guy himself that Donald Trump President Trump you think he'll do at least one more visit here before the final election did\nA pretty confident that that's going to happen and I think we're going to see more down junior as well I think they enjoy the fishing and hunting in our state and we're very excited to have them show up at a valley county event and and they're going to be around more as

Sheppard\nWhole they shut from gardener too uh\nColumbus down in a deal any my flow and that was a hundred year the park and not just that just devastated or water rafting companies and the and the recreational people\nAnd sure it was a low water here and it was hot here and and you know they actually didn't know a whole lot about it so now we're at the point where\nThey realize that this organism been in the water they had some water samples or the bureau minds or somewhere that a whole twenty some years old and they tested those and guess what that organism was was there and then\nThey could do the DNA test on it and it was a sample wars in the in that water then so we have that organism in the river so is it a case of too many white fish was white a white fish had such a bigger you know I'm not a biologist and you know I'm just a rancher\nBut I watch I watched\nAs most ranchers do we watch the weather we watched the wildlife we watch for livestock we watch our\nCrawl impacts your business all day to day and always has found that I didn't\nYou know everybody talks the buzzword holistic management well we have to do it that way where so many of the agencies in so many people look at one facet and they forget the rest yeah and there was called the shutdown theory gators and that sort of thing to\nGive his when they shut and when they shut down that section of the Yellowstone River a large section at the time\nUm they they were even I think I remember hearing from you they're even shutting down some of the smaller tributaries that that fed into it if I if I'm not mistaken but you you mentioned that um that that the administration in Helena\nIs is not letting a a good crisis go to waste so what are they so as a result of of that shut down the river back in sixteen how are they now taking advantage of how are they putting a crisis or how are they putting that crisis to use\nWell it's not necessarily just them but it's also a to the environmental groups are using this for fundraising on and to me I think it ties right into by one eighty six your clean water thing and\nYou know we've got to save the water and save this but they forget their water also out on the land provide a lot of habitat for a while I Can't think just about the fish we've got to look at everything\nYou take the ... acres off and how were the world wildlife gonna eat since Ninety percent of the wildlife resides on private ground which is irrigated\nRemember when fish while Evan parks that will put out one of their magazines how you know all the all the wildlife are hanging out on private land and I think it was a study done here in the ... paradise valley and and they thought it was because maybe the hunters were scaring the wildlife off a public land but there's people to hunt on private land to so maybe it's just that all those ranchers out there actually\nIn Maine [noise] during\nThe show anytime my calling the room rock camp and the company's online as thorough six to nine four zero nine Seventy says Montana talks on GB well am nine Seventy introduced talk Ninety five point five ...\nAre we going to talk about vice and we're going to talk about a potential mining ban in the area plus a bid state Senate race and we haven't talked too much about the legislative races going on there but there is a big state Senate race going on here in Livingston area Aaron ... here back with Montana talk so\nI told you once I got this equipment ready to roll we had a remote broadcast equipment ready that I'd be out of the studio a lot a lot we got a great studio there in downtown buildings you know ... the double tree hotel overlooking the entire west and you can see the barracks you can see the prior person there but that we got a great studio\nThis morning right now as we're in paradise valley Montana pray Montana\nA got a great deal of the mountains out their camp fires still burning overlooking the pond out back here right next to the Yellowstone River and joined us also the other good opportunity about getting out of the studios you get up get out and get to see folks in person\nInstead of just talking to them on the phone line so that's why I Love traveling the state so right now to catch up with representative Alan red filled out a parade Montana and our thanks again for sticking around with us is\nMore you better do you have to take advantage of these opportunities also I mean once in a while he goes would call me a paint on Egypt bad because of a new spot fill this this this works out good ones you don't have to just drive a couple of miles and getting in the studio\nUsually when we're calling is because there's\nIt's like hey out what the heck's going on out there what's going on with vice in what's going on with the Yellowstone River and and you're the guy to call a for for the the facts and the and the inside to know what's going on the ground maybe on that front so\nFirst off kind of give us give us both sides of this debate so I'm interior secretary Ryan Zinke he uh is here in uh paradise valley this morning we should be talking with them later on the show\nHe's expected to finalize a proposal to block the new mining claims on the forest in public lands just outside Yellowstone National park this was according to the Associated Press or give us kind of both sides of the issue here a form of a you know from somebody who lives in the area\nFor part of this you know to me it's a very it's complicated and I tried to I tried to keep my nose but for a while to all the dust settles and um I think we're finally getting to that point\nQuite a few people think and maybe rightly so that if they did the mining and they're working on it and I double they portrayed it as a as a big strip mine are open pit and it would be the city soils and then it would the water washing and it would cause all of mine the mine a\nWaste and and the run off it would go right to\nYellowstone River which within affected all the way down to to you know all the way to the Gulf and uh\nThat was that's a big concern and there's a lot of water in the immigrant area if you go up there right now they're still water coming out some of the test also pay goes as did back in the eighties [noise]\nBut on the other hand there's a lot of mining claims have been in there since probably Eighteen Seventy\nSome of those are still active some of those people are still doing some of the same kinds of things and so that's a private property rights\nAnd so we have to balance\nAnd so right now when they put this ban on cell take care of a thing on a federal and but it doesn't affect the private land but it could on the market ability of it because they couldn't expand because they couldn't go underneath onto the onto the public ground\nSo there are some issues there whether it's going to affect a private property rights and and that's where I come in with the uh\nMy concerns is is that a step\nIn always always look at that as that is that bar I Will bind the mining my part of it it will affect those private property rights well next\nWe can't cut the timber on who wants to cut the term brown the federal land which is how we have a hard time getting that done any way and a lot of this timber right behind just needs to be cut yeah yeah I mean there's some disease in it\nSo we aren't get map cuts but then are they going to say well we don't like if you show do you go to Bozeman on that state ground over there they're having a big cut out about that they don't want to cut\nThe trees on a state landslide pulled his dying and it needs to be cut\nIn the debate kind of seems to me here I I think those can kinda understand both sides here to the extent that okay we get it that the ... valley has changed over the years you know it's heavy a tourism because of the you know because of ... and gardener mammoth being right up the road or because of the river the fly fishing and the outfitters and things like that\nUm but at the end of the day you know agriculture still a big driver here too\nSo I think folks can say okay hey it's right outside of Yellowstone National park I guess I was so we can see why why there that this withdrawal might happen here but then there's the other the other side of us that are saying hey wait a minute you know\nMining has changed since the\nSince the Eighteen hundreds since the early Nineteen hundreds ... since the mid to late nineties mining has changed in the equipment and the modernization and the safeguards in place so so you know what what's with this whole ban in the first place I at that at least that's kinda the way I see it from from an outsider's perspective coming\nSo you know what what's with this whole ban in the first place I at that at least that's kinda the way I see it from from an outsider's perspective coming from a little further east from here\nAnd I see the same kinds of things where\nYou know where everything's affected at some point in time and and as a matter of culture as the water is a big deal for us all you know growing up eastern Montana we didn't have water like we have here and we're dependent on it we want clean water we don't want our land a\nDecimate either in one of the one of my friends is a rancher right here in and he gets water out of that critic so it would you know in fact got\nSpoiled it would be devastating to him and the people downstream also so it's a balancing act it's it's really kind of hard yeah but then again we need the someplace we need to be able to mind because we need those minerals or we're going to be dependent on a third world country that doesn't have the rules that we have\nYeah you want to your green cars you want your you know electric cars that you're charging charging stations all you need you need access to those rare earth minerals you need which means you need money to make that happen I but I also wonder from maybe from another tactical perspective does is allow\nConservatives does is allow the Trump Administration and others in Montana they say okay hey\nWe're not going to die on on that we're not going to die trying to mind that hill are not gonna die on that hill but\nIt does it give them the ability now to go forward and develop you know good mining operations like like you know the like the heckler mining projects near Libby in and out near knocks in and and uh and maybe you're white silver springs\nWhy they get to that might be a good way to look at it and maybe the way we should look at it All right we're going to mitigate here we kind of mine here and\nAs long as we don't touch on the private guys\nAnd you know the one and Libby\nIs here's an example of let's\nLets permit it for Twenty years and ... costs twenty million dollar but yeah we don't get anything to the let's just go over the over the hill here and we could still water\nYou talked about first class still won the water might Abe's is doing amazing things and it's up to up the main Boulder and that's in my district and you take a tour of that in mind you are impressed and you have to water treatment plant I mean that's better than than most of the cities have\nThen you drive is that right at the base of the piece of the ... and it's an incredible operation you wouldn't even realize if you didn't know anything about it you wouldn't even realize that there was a mine operating miles underneath that saying well it is a that's a that's an a great example of hey look this is modern lining for you right here there's still our minds it really well and it\nProvides pays for forty percent of the property tax in sweet grass county I mean they're getting stuff done this week grass county that they would know way be able to do any other way\nAnd oh by the way they are still fly fishing is still a lot of love\nYou are still finishing up the Boulder and having all kinds of\nPeople I mean more people using it being over done they're practically driving some a lot of the land of crazy up their member of people do many outsiders El Al ... you know they discovered it your Yellowstone too busy well as close as little one over here well in our bodies finding that one too so\nIt's like I got a friend over there that you know some families that long time as the property and and I think he has to spend more of his time telling people to get out it's not for sale you know anything well and that happened\nYou know who we see that in a paradise valley I mean you mean when we first discovered it my ... my father in law to people driving or gave me six figures and he's about ten you know just back them off because they don't want your piece of property or a piece of paradise and you know and and think that you're just willing to sell it and they try to buy your lifestyle and you can't\nBuy it yeah well we're talking with representative Alan ... here and I pray Montana a lawmaker in the region I'm

are fighting forest fires are terrorists you know it's a legit twelve times does it goes from the Virgin Islands other without the pullout a FIFA territory falls under a tour we have five hundred and Seventy three federally recognized tribes [noise]\nAh we have four hundred and Seventeen park units are we at offshore energy we have a responsibility of educating forty thousand\nUh Indian kids and we're also the stewards of our greatest treasures probably about Seventy thousand employees that's interior ah but the interior represents the people\nAnd you know when it comes to public lands one should look at the Teddy Roosevelt arches your ear to the park for the benefit and enjoyment of the people yeah ah so the people's lands uh we should take care of it\nToo often it's become let's keep the people out or they it's this is not for the benefit of of the people at the way\nWith public access ah we've opened up the year and a half about five million acres more of experience for hunting opportunities thirty eight wildlife refuges if we're close the hunting and fishing or now open\nAgain ah we're reviewing public access recreational opportunities to make sure that it's not just for the elite\nThat can afford a helicopter or you know made in China companies\nAre are public lands belongs to the public they deserve access and they did they also deserve stewardship which is taking care of the land and make sure would always catastrophic for his first or shut gates a where people can't even ride a bike I get on their land\nYeah yeah and yet those same a left wing special interest groups would have to sit here and say public access public access meanwhile they're the biggest proponents of shutting down access to a lot of well and is it ...\nOther burn the entire forest down than harvest a single tree yeah\nUh and yet we've in Durango watershed has has been inundated with silt lost all a lot a lot of fish and the Durango base and\nThe again that the scale of these fires in some cases sterilizing the soil is look at the amount of pseudo and and that of the subsequent landslides in a loss of of life needlessly\nIf you're just manage upfront you can mitigate a lot of that you can't stop all fires or we don't want to but we certainly want to make sure that we have healthy for us\nI Know coming up hearing about a little over a half an hour you're gonna make a big announcement here in paradise valley according to Associated Press you're expected to finalize a proposal to block new mining claims on the forest in public lands just outside of Yellowstone National park what can you tell us about the announcement this morning and\nAnd what might just say to some of those you know conservative or pro mining critics out there are skeptics who might say ... banning mining we we need more money we need more of this type of activity\nAnd I'm I'm a geologist and and there are some places the mind and there's some places not to my uh be up in the northwest Montana you're eureka Detroit those are absolutely the right place or the mind\nWhen you look at our nation's critical minerals cobalt lithium there's a there's a lot of critical minerals we've we want to make sure we're not held hostage by China and other nations\nThere's also the stewardship sided there's places that are sensitive\nThat that should be looked at with a more careful by a paradise valley here when I was a congressman who was first brought to my attention you know Chico community I sat down with community leaders looked at it uh this is not a place uh to mind\nA it's a sensitive water base and a and you know the people in paradise valley we're sitting in a in a now a new lives age it's a thirty million dollar DSL new\nFacility here about a good idea what\nWhat there's all there's a lot of eggs\nAnd uncertainty about things and and it's hard to have investment it's hard for for people to invest you know long term when there is a cloud you know over it\nSo the forest service uh did their work and the way that the forest service property works is services department of egg exercise through U.S Forest service\nSub surface is bureau of land management uh which is me\nAgain I'm I'm a geologist a\nYou know I'm I'm very pro mining there's places that are appropriate\nFor resource development and the same thing with oil and gas I Will and they are withdraws for for a while but court orders but again you have to look at the system make sure that a mining plan is appropriate if it's not appropriate make the decision earlier so\nLimited agree or disagree but you know here in the paradise valley they have had a coalition kind of across the party coalition saying hey\nWe don't want to have money right next to Yellowstone National park because of these other industries whereas places like light silver springs places like Montana knocks and they're saying hey there's there's local sports saying no we need and we want these minds up and running so this is a real degree this is this is what you know across the spectrum of locals are asking\nHere and this is why you have a ... process or you look at the the science behind that the watersheds you look at the methodology you look at best practices you look at the science and you make a determination of and in the long run a what's the interest of the public was the interest of\nOr in in this part of southwest and kind of south central Montana's especially sometimes I think I think those of us in the bill in the area forget how much we have in common with folks in Livingston area we're both kind of gateway communities in the end of the park from different court orders but uh yeah well what I was going on down here what are the big issues that you're tracking a Allen\nWell are measured or back into the in the vice and issues and on the other is the Yellowstone River and and the health of the river and there's been a lot of lot of stuff going on with that the watershed group working on it and they had a water symposium in the west critic ranch in late September\nUm had agency people and\nAnd the other organizations plus a few landowners and I thought we were\nFairly overwhelmed with that and um they focused on a river but we're trying to focus on the complete watershed\nAs a as a watershed group and that that's one of the biggest issues and the whole ... thing was to me is never let a crisis go to waste you know by our state administration is going to be\nSo now with this ... this was when the Yellowstone River when the whole chunk of it was shut down back was that twenty sixteen I'm trying to recall a year that happened but the L L section ...\nSheppard oh they shut from Gardner to uh\nColumbus down and ah didn't let anybody flow and that was a hundred year the park and not just that just devastated over water rafting companies and the\nAnd the recreational people's hand ... water here and it was hot here and and you know they actually didn't know a whole lot about it so now we're at the point where\nThey realize it says Oregon has been in the water that has water samples or the bureau\nAnd I said says Oregon has been in the water they had some water samples or the bureau minds or somewhere\nThat old twenty some years old and they tested those and guess what that organization was was back then\nThey can do the DNA test on it and it was a sample wars in the in that water there and so we have that organism in the river so is it a case of too many white fish is why the white fish had such a big you know I'm not a biologist and you know I'm just a rancher but I watch I watched\nAs most ranchers do we watched and whether we watch the wildlife we watch for livestock we watch our\nCrawl impacts your ... there all day to day and always inside their livelihood and\nYou know everybody talks the buzzword holistic management well we have to do with that way where so many of the agencies in so many people will get one facet and they forget the rest yeah and there was called to shut down their era gators and that sort of thing too\nIs when they shut and when they shut down that section of the Yellowstone River a large section at the time um that they were even I think I remember hearing from you they're even shutting down some of the smaller tributaries that the fed into it if if I'm not mistaken but you you mentioned that uh that that the administration in Helena\nIs is not letting a a good crisis go to waste so what are they so as a result of of that shut down the river back in sixteen how are they now taking advantage of how are they putting a crisis or how are they putting that crisis to use\nWell it's not necessarily just them but it's also the uh\nThe the environmental groups are using this for fundraising on and to me I think it ties right into by one eighty six your clean water thing and\nYou know we've got a per se the water and save this but they forget the water also out on the land provide a lot of habitat for a while I Can't say just about the fish we've got to look at everything you take the ... acres off and I were the world wildlife gonna eat since Ninety percent of the wildlife resides on private ground which is irrigated\nI remember when fish wildlife in parks that will put out and one of their magazines how\nHe'll out all the all the wildlife are hanging out on private land and I think it was a study done here in the ... paradise valley and and they thought it was because maybe the hundreds were scaring the wildlife all public land but there's people that aren't on private land to so maybe it's just that all those ranchers out there actually provide better wildlife habitat\nThan sometimes on the you know on the government land you know\nWell if you look at it if you're if you're an elk and there's a nice green alfalfa hay meadow there you're going to eat that are you going to go and eat the brush\nAnd then you go to the guys that are have any big ranches that are buying them up and there's nowhere living cattle on while they proved that in the center of the game range back in the seventies or that the help of follow the cattle and and if you if you want to go further than that these people had sheep all over the country in these mountains\nSo she went back there and they are eating all the weeds and they're keeping all that stuff\nSo I guess they held lead anything right and well and the L L could follow those\nCars these the newer shoots and so it kept them up higher and also you kept a while the\nThe predators we're kinda dispersed better so now they're predators are bigger groups and pushing that you know Ninety five we saw a major major push to help out into the valley floor\nBecause of the wolf re introduction and you know and everybody talks about the world for a nurse but let's talk about the other thing the grizzly bear in the room\nYou know there's ... I mean there's grizzly bear within ... uh three miles away and we're sitting here at this age laws\nAnd we're right on and we're not too far off the highway or what a you know a mile and a half off the off the highway ...\nRiver and two miles from immigrant and I know that there is at least one rosy bear within two to three miles overseeing right now I've got a picture on my phone to track burger my hand and between the my shopping my Barney so that morning\nIn I mean here in the same thing from folks who live out or got cabins out near red lodge and out along the ... front that they said man that's the grizzlies or or out of ...\nI mean here in the same thing from folks who live out or got cabins out near red lodge and out along the ... front that they said man that's the grizzlies or or out of control right now well\nLast week if there was a video or on dry correct which was about four or five miles south of here on the other side of the river which are fighting over there on the highway going into the subdivision I got that got everybody far right up first you know and I keep telling people\nThat you know this liberal judge in Helena had to put the grizzly hunt in Wyoming to stop you know to to protect the grizzly when when even you know even um grizzly enthusiasts are saying hey it's time to take them off the endangered list et cetera\nWell everybody has an agenda and and one of the genders or the you know on the Yukon and that's the latest one and we're in a way as if people were in the way\nHow how important would you say that uh that you know farmers and ranchers are here in the paradise valley because obviously there are some great new tourism things going on here too but really it's still farmers and ranchers that are the basis of the you know the Montana economy here\nWhat were you write about in the paradise dollar we're on between six to seven thousand head of cattle in the home based in paradise valley at least so you know that's a that's a big\nBig number when you start looking at marketing them and and you know everybody talks about every dollar turned over seven times of humanity but you also remember that and our cultural dollar sat dollar wasn't here last year it's a new product it's something that wasn't here before\nSo sure we turned seven time but this is something new was not somebody's recycle dollars is a new dollar and so that's that's hugely important we pay a lot of property taxes and and one of the things they don't and then I'll have to agree on coalition right now is every licensing open space provided by the ranchers\nFor big factor in one of the big draws ... valley\nYeah I think one of those one of the bumper stickers that even conservatives will will go sometimes ... cows not condos you know and so but that goes back to I was good that President Trump to help fix the estate tax and things like that because they've been taxing these farmers and ranchers ... what do you think's going to happen to it well enough\nAnd that happened in the past I Would say in the past I've been here forty one years and yeah when I moved here if you look look quite a little different than it does now and we've lost probably a third of the ranchers\nIn that time and a lot of a rural small and their families could make go over and\nAnd so that's also in a subdivision laws changing so a lot of that got cut up and then when the\nRiver and through movie made was just ... just killed us you know that movie I Wish that movie and never come out as far as a person in the paradise valley because of what has changed yeah yeah and now that we're in October the traffic has changed consider because now we have\nAre a few fisherman a lot of fishermen and and the tourist trafficking uh park is reduced so now the rest of us can go back to normal\nYou get back to the day to day life yeah\nAll right so that was our conversation with Alan red field a lawmaker here in the living in sin area great to see him down here we broadcast live in paradise valley just any minute now secretary Ryan Zinke he will be making this announcement here\nUh let's see um I also got a chance to real quickly to catch up

paradise valley near near Yellowstone National park so\nI had a chance to catch up with him I'll Try to share that audio with it because I had to catch him in the middle there before the announcement
