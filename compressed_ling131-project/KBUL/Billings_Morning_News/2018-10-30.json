cabinet company phone lines here we are one week to go before the November elections or somebody you're just ready to get these campaign commercials off the airwaves aren't you well joining us now on the phone lines\nAre here to talk about you know all the the top stories with one week to go to Rachel subtle and Fox News radio uh Rachel always a pleasure to have you here on Montana talks thanks for having me what are the major themes heading into the uh the final week of the election\nWell I think it it's about possibly the president's schedule and where he is going\nAnd where he's campaigning in the final stretch and they said that President Trump is the name will be in Fort Myers Florida it's going to return to Florida on Saturday and that is where there's a very tight Senate race between Republican governor Rick Scott is trying to in the comet\nA democratic Senator Bill Nelson the president also traveled to Indiana twice my or on the Republican there is leading income and democratic Senator Joe Donnelly\nA by only about three points according to CBS poll that released on Sunday at three points within the polls margin of error so you're seeing a lot of these tight Senate races and taking a look at the president's schedule by the way he will be in your state look\nLooks like the president's really focusing on\nOn the Senate and or your own a Senator Jon tester he's not a fan and I don't need to tell you about the senator tester so he'll be there obviously I'm a for a Senate candidate Matt Rosendale a though the president has you on on the agenda there as well\nUh he's got rally after rally after rally and then the night before and that the mid term he'll be in Fort Wayne Indiana where Joe Donnelly as I was mentioning is it has this um this chance of of being toppled a there and and Republicans flipping that seat to read\nYeah yeah you mentioned his visit to Montana this Saturday twelve thirty a decision on Saturday afternoon the Associated Press here in Montana they actually look back they checked all the records they said this is unprecedented this is the first time a sitting president has visited the state of Montana more than three times [laughter] so\nYeah I'm ... and what I find it also interesting here is where the president is not going with one week to go ... in North Dakota apparently he's not going to North Dakota I mean the last when he came here to billings Montana or his next stop was the north Dakota but\nUh so so I I mean it sounds like to me like he's not going to North Dakota because basically the Republicans are so confident that now they picked up that seat from Heidi Heitkamp\nWell it's looking like Heidi Heitkamp is going to falter we don't know for sure uh but she's been in a very tough race for her seat there uh again she's a red state Democrats\nAll these red state Democrats are having a tough time in this case it her Republican challengers representative Kevin Cramer and he's open up a lead in recent poll so it it is very telling where the where the president's going and as you mentioned where he's not going or so and it it focusing on\nOn some of these other states including your own he'll be in Huntington West Virginia on friday that's where\nA Joe Manchin who is a Democrat and a red state of again Republicans hoping to be able to topple him the strategy appears to be here for Republicans hold on to the Senate pick up a few extra seats the Senate widen the margin there and well understanding that Democrats may pick up some seats in the house there's a chance they could take control of the house so it really this is a firewall\nAnd so if you're looking at the schedule you'll have the money that's spent they they're really looking to hold on to the Senate but we really won't know I\nI Would imagine we all think we're going to know late at night on November seventh I don't know about that some of these races are so close uh that that could be some challenges there could be a sin delays and finding out who won\nIn ... and I know in in Yellowstone county Montana in particular the elections administrator said because of me to page ballad\nYou could take them two days after capital of the vote so that would make it even more frustrating for folks um ... what do you think this says about\nThe president coming to Montana that I I guess my my thought is this is a president who likes to when he likes to be seen as a winter he wouldn't be coming to Montana unless he thinks the Republicans have a very good chance of winning this race\nI think so and I also quite honestly I think he has a little bit of a personal vendetta Jon Tester help bring down\nA well well I gave is a White House doctor Ronny Jackson a hard time when it comes to he's going to be VA secretary [noise] um so I wouldn't be surprised if it's a little bit of beef with Jon Tester but at the same time\nHe's eight Republicans really want a the seat and it it's been really close um you know heading in so I think that does it does speak volumes are though I think the latest or most recent polling was showing custard Rosendale pretty neck and neck\nUm but and others have shown\nSingle and kind of back and forth so I think that the president what this may decide he wants to try to seal the deal and also there could be more rallies addicts schedule even though it's pretty ... he's an air force one and they just they turn his plane around we're going to go back to Montana or something like\nThat you never know well and I told the people the White House I was like hey you know he he doesn't even need to plan a big rally I mean he could just pick up the phone and call a radio talk show too you\nKnow arguing some maybe he'll call you guys out there right now to eat something remember what happened\nTo Congress and Mark Sanford the former governor of South Carolina the Republican ethic as one tweet that brought him down um he was the never Trump her ... and he lives in the primary doubt the president really has a lot of our with his tweeting with his his presence when he shows up a can influence elections they say\nYeah I'll bet I'll bet senator chest or is it might be

the CNN panel\nUm and and she actually said that she ... she says that Donald Trump has quote radicalized more people than ISIS it yet yeah Donald Trump is radicalized more people than ISIS that is how absurd uh these folks in the media are getting\nA just just insane or in fact this that's the topic that Greg ... felt tackled yesterday on the five on Fox News or so we hear a I'll just play his whole monologue yesterday\nWell that didn't take long no one sets the tone more than ...\nIt is evil this man was in flames and his hatred were fan by a president who kept talking about this caravan\nRefugees as if they weren't terrorists\nSo as they blame ... words for violence and do they realize they're excusing the violent acts themselves well offering a case for leniency for the actual perks and the actions of evildoers or out of their own control and nothing else could have led to the violence\nAnd how can they even begin to punish these creams it's wrong meanwhile for both the bomber and the shooter President Trump Mr law and order pushes the death penalty\nThere is no ambiguity there he places the blame of firmly on the dirt bags and like most Republicans seeks out the ... penalty literally ... this contradicts the media who seems Trump as a hateful ringleader sympathizes with such acquaintance\nSpeaking of those suspects they were total losers failures in life who place their range on others and anyone with an opinion could provide a trigger because we're can influence its why there's advertising\nBut that's a scary path and take especially for Hollywood rap stars in video game makers or even people pain to speak carefully and thoughtfully\nThe president of the United states is racist\nEven Albert Einstein may have ended up for the Nazi concentration camp when Donald Trump standpoint on immigration\nYou vote for Trump thing you know voter new not Donald Trump for standing at the bar border like Nazis so you hear you hear\nSo you want hate spend two years gone a guy Hitler racist a trainer and insane\nThen you blame them for violence because the nicknames no lectures from you kids\nBut even more to cite words as the cause eliminates the suspects empire and history and the slew of variables that brought him to commit any crimes it makes no sense legally or morally but politically I guess that's another story\nAfter all why let a crisis go to

they're opposing I one eighty five especially since part of the ad campaigns for the supporters of eye when eighty five are claiming that it will somehow help veterans\nYet the one of the largest veterans organizations in the state\nNow coming out with a unanimous vote by the way it's not like this was some bitter a divisive discussion a unanimous vote opposing I wanted he fought so that's a huge story I've got that posted news talk not five five dot com there's also another huge story\nUm I mean and the rest of the you know that\nThe establishment media is kind of making my job easy for me here because I Love being able to share stories that nobody else is covering\nUm as I Love to get to do that um you know now some of these stories it's like how come you're not covering this this is news uh but anyway uh I I mean so for example I I talked about this at the at the top of the six o'clock hour when we kick off the show here on Montana talks but\nOkay so some some rich privileged liberal white guy who owns Patagonia endorses liberal Senator Jon tester\nAnd and the Associated Press does this big story and it gets printed and covered all over the state of Montana\nA Patagonia endorses a liberal John ... who cares ... who cares and and look I I don't even think I have a patio and yet AT T shirt even I mean I I'd rather get a local product like you know like the great Aspen wall a outdoor clothing from downtown they'll you know I'd rather get stuff like that right\nAh but ah but it but it but at the same time like OK Patagonia you want to do your political gains good for you good for you I'm not calling anybody to boycott you just because you have different political opinions than I Do know no big deal right but my problem is with the establishment media that says well that's a story\nI mean it was like there are so desperate to say something anything good about liberal Senator Jon tester then it's like a whole Patagonia indoors the judges who cares nobody cares but yet here and now we had major news take place major Newsday place it was officially announced yesterday morning\nUm but I as I told you yesterday on the show uh I I I was seeing the pictures and the imagery coming out of Lewis town Montana and I was like I told you that show like I I think the chairman of the girls tribe may have just endorsed Matt Rosendale in the Senate race but but you don't say that until you actually know it well we got the official word yesterday I saw the video for myself\nAh the crow tribal chairman AJ not afraid uh is endorsing Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale I've got the audio will share it with you later this morning here on Montana talks it's also posted the full video from Lewis town is now posted on our website news talk nonstop\nHe later this morning here on Montana talks it's also posted the full video from Louis down\nA is now posted on our website news talk nine five five a dot com so if you want to check out that video before I play I'm probably going to save that for the nine o'clock hour 'cause we got a lot coming up here in eight o'clock hour a former CIA operative Charles Sam Faddis kicks off the eight o'clock hour\nTo talk about the deep state with him and then we'll talk with Roger hanging from the American legion after that what we do now have been was police chief rich St John in Studio with us here chief good to see if they are in an air and how are you doing doing good doing good first off thanks to you and you're a police officers I I saw I think it was a cue to news story\nOr that the Jewish community in billings was very appreciative of your efforts to step up patrols are following the horrific attack in in Pennsylvania over the weekend may have been across the country but it's it's a good year pay an extra care and attention to folks back here in our own backyard\nAs well yeah I absolutely uh certainly a tragedy I'm In Pittsburgh and or anything we can do to support um our neighbors friends here in billings we couldn't we're happy to do that so uh you know just just a little bit of show support\nYeah of course the president is off to Pittsburgh later this morning as I understand it as well I'm Still this hoax device they're calling it it was so it's not like some crazy guy who was speaking ... she was talking with a cue to news director John ... a friend of ours and\nAnd John was like this and we're going on her then the guy leaves and leaves us some crazy looking plastic devise a container so John does the right thing calls the police what what's the story what happened what do you know so far\nYeah that's pretty much go there and as I'm with that a person a came to the back door which is secured um uh that cute to John went out and ask them what he was doing and I got some unintelligible response\nAh and then took off running and uh as he did daddy drop the plastic tote one of the things that you might find them ones garage for storing things so a pretty big\nI'm inside it was a a bunch of a random items uh computer keyboard or some\nScissors some papers or what not um out of an abundance of caution when our officers got there they took a look at it I decided that they probably ought to have the bomb squad take a look at it we have some specialized equipment that allows us to do that safely a cue to staff was asked a shelter in place\nA move away from the door and I and into the basement area\nOr in our bomb squad deployed around a robot with a with a tool that basically can remotely open that package if there is an explosive device in it and the debt ... then we just have property damage nobody hurt a gives us about a opportunity to um to to tear that that package open to see what's in there\nAnd they saw just that some components that potentially at first glance could be construed as an improvised explosive device or components there of\nA no explosives or nothing hooked together but certainly suspicious enough and again out of a bunch of caution ah we took a look at that so yeah we're very very pleased that uh\nI you know that that turned out to be nothing a lot of those things are intended to disrupt business a it's a scare tactic uh then again if you have somebody that is a ... unintelligible speaking\nA you know Jim Carrey shows you said that you might be dealing with some sort of mental issue but yeah uh we we took care of the problem ah disrupted downtown a little bit but uh but uh got taken care of so very very uh very ...\nDown this guy yet or not to my knowledge okay as their survey and I'm assuming they're doing everything they can to try to track down this person down the aisle slowly um does it what is it seemed like the motivations were here well\nWhen you target the media\nOf a lot of uh of rhetoric out there uh both pro media anti media and so I I don't know exactly what some of the literature was that was in ... in the container I did hear some religious um\nWritings I don't know what that means but again sometimes when you're dealing with the mentally ill ah assuming that uh that that's what we're dealing with you just have no idea what the thought process but at the end of the day I'm we're very fortunate that that turned out to be um you know what we're calling a host of us yeah\nSo it does look like the like the guy did wants to deliver some sort of message or try to scare people at the news room or is it\nThe fall lineup and show information at news talk Ninety five five dot com live and ... in the mornings was Russia\nRamsey Hannity and back this is ... ... am nine Seventy and

was this great piece\nUm and it was in late August it was an interview with CIA operative Charles Sam Faddis on the state of us counter intelligence I mean they covered everything from hey what's your thoughts on the deep state\nAnd these are you know so called intelligence officials\nAre basically attacking a president Donald Trump and the leaking of all this information it they covered every

I mean this is an incredibly important thing in an incredibly damaging thing [noise] you know you\nYou have to have a ... law enforcement agencies and your intelligence agencies you have to have a completely rigorous adherence to the law into the constitution you're not serving\nYou know any political party in particular are serving the people over the United states and and there are lines you absolutely cannot cross a should never even contemplate crossing of Brennan as a prime example of a guy\nWho just blew all that off but I mean running running was a CIA analyst he was never an operator and at a very early point in his career he got named to be the presidential prefer it to President Bill Clinton\nWhich means he was the guy who went down every morning and sat down with the president and basically worry them on what had happened overnight and he partly the personal relationship\nInto a political alliance with the Clintons from that point on he wasn't ever a professional he was a political hack everything is done in his career since\nHas been based on that alliance and the political connections he spun out of that so you know one of the things that drives me crazy about him when I hear him constantly talking is he he pretends to be some sort of sage wise\nNeutral observer interested only in the security of the republic setting off to the side commenting\nWent in fact you know he is again a partisan hacker you might as well be listening to Hillary Clinton or her page spokesperson when you listen to John Brennan that's that's what you're what you're hearing and obviously as an American citizen they can say what he wants but as I wrote in and out\nKnock off pretending like you're you are neutral or dispassionate you chose your side decades ago yeah it's and that's what you are\nAnd then he and then he calls for the overthrow basically the democratically elected president then wonders why against the security glare stripped away it's like yeah you can't calling for the overthrow of of the government basically and expect to maintain your security clearance I hate to break into you there uh John Brennan\nWhere we think in general I you know one of the things I tried to stress is this the spying operation the Obama administration's by operation that was launched on the Trump campaign we now know now we know the Steele dossier was a fake it was phony was filled with all sorts of fake information\nThat we used to justify spying on the Trump campaign\nBut I but I was trying to make the point that then hey\nDon't listen to CNN and some of these other outlets when they say well the intelligence community is critical of President Trump look some political ... back in Washington DC that happen to be holdovers from the Obama administration that work at these and higher up levels of these agencies are ... you know they're the ones that are leaking this information and violating their old\nBut the but I but I was trying to be clear hate the men and women on the ground the men and women that work for the FBI and I had imagined for all these other agencies out there\nThey do incredible work they do find work and they're the ones who are who are who are you know who are being made to look bad because of some political ... page and others back in D.C which I think\nThat's really important point I mean this is not a [noise] this is not an infection\nThat spreads you know far and wide to to the vast majority of people in these organizations those folks are out there putting their lives on the line you know generally for for mediocre pay and the recognition every day they deserve our respect but clearly there are some people with top\nWho just completely lost the bubble if if they ever had um we FBI's the with the volt and some of these senior FBI folks in the early stage stages of this\nTrump or whatever it is I Would say investigation but it's a sham investigation\nI find really troubling and I don't think we have gotten to the to the bottom of it yet as to how early this started they claimed initially that this was all based on the the Steele dossier as you said\nNot only is it been discredited but they've now had to admit that they were actually working this well before that came to light\nSo now potentially viewpoint of genesis is\nMeetings that Papadopoulos had with people but it's unclear why that would have generated a an investigation I mean in normal times if you were in the FBI and you stumbled across something that threatened to pull you into the middle of a political campaign for president\nHe was head of the CIA counterterrorism center and the W W and even the counterterrorism center CIA retired I operated Sam Faddis here on Montana talks with us Sam interesting on the phone\nLines here for just a few more minutes with us now we could go on for hours just just incredibly insightful um so the deep state is real now the the follow up question is is I I guess described the threat of the deep state what it really is how great of a threat it is and then how we counter it\nWell to start with you have this this conception this machine that the founders build based on three equal branches of government with various checks and balances and nowhere in the conception is there\nA role for a bureaucracy other than to take orders from those three branches and carry out functions and and that's how they view didn't know how it was viewed for most of our history you're in a bureaucracy you're in an agency laws are made the president gives orders you do what you're supposed to do\nNow we have a something very very different we have an unelected fourth branch of government in effect\nIn these bureaucracies\nWith folks at the top\nIn many cases who decide for themselves what they think policy should be and then no matter what the law says and no matter what the president tells them they are then going to do their level best to carry out policies that they have decided upon\nSo on accountable to anybody uncontrolled by anybody and now this bureaucracy is fast it is not a handful of people as it was for most of our history it's millions of people with huge sums of money and influence so that means to start with you've lost control\nOf a big chunk of your government and then when you add to that the fact that they begin to not just decide for themselves what those policies are but to ally themselves with particular political interests as we have seen with the Trump situation\nIndia could be anywhere from national security leaders trying to undermine the president or trying to steer policy the way they wanted to be here all the way down to maybe a land managers of land management agencies back here in Montana that say well I don't like logging so I'm going to leak this information in the Sierra Club to help their lawsuit\nA bitter and this should terrify you yeah because\nYou know it could be if they could skew one way today and ten years from now skew a different way just because they're making decisions now\nYou you maybe you have Donald Trump and so the fact that people are taking action against his administration you think that's great well not great because a few years from now when somebody from your party is in office\nThey may be doing exactly the same thing I mean the answer here is to work within the Democratic\nFramework you don't like the guy gets in office vote him out of office replace him but you can't have these people\nJust deciding on their own as you said to leak information or to frustrate executive action you can have that\nYeah yeah like I said 'cause you know is that the national guard veteran myself you know when I went to Iraq under George W Bush into Afghanistan under President Obama it's not like you can just lay right for them\nI don't like a rock Obama's on numbers from a rifle down not do my job now but that's what these deep state bureaucrats on unfortunately are doing and luckily project ... and others are kind of exposing them but either way Sam Sam Faddis it's been great honor to get to talk with you thanks again for your service to our country\nAnd are you what do you what do you do in in your off time now that you have to be retired from the CIA and everything\nWell my wife and I run a company called or to miss we'd do a lot of security work we stood up our own online ... online magazine called and a and B a I'm I've gotten involved in politics the last few years I may maybe getting ready to run for office here next year\nUh I ... I moved on from one life and and I'm busier than ever\nTo help that you have you back in Virginia or someplace like that or where do you where do you\nCall I live in the ... I live in the state of Maryland which\nAs a registered Republican makes every day a challenge um but uh yeah I Lived I Lived\nNot too far from Washington DC I mean that's kind of the center of the gravity of a lot of the center of gravity of a lot of work\nWe sure yeah yeah well I'll tell you when the world before we run I've got um I'm expecting a call we're we're supposed to have a Roger hanging from the American legion of Montana joined us here in a few minutes talking about one of our ballot initiatives but while we await his phone call we got another phone call from a listener can we take another phone call we got just an absolute okay great All right let's go to Dave in billings day very their\nStatus in billings Seventy five years old\nI was ... years old when Kennedy was assassinated I'm sure that I was so sure every year was involved back even back then and it's obvious now that there were these involvement in a Kennedy's assassination what does a comment on this\nOh okay All right so are you okay so the deep state has been around much longer before but then but then you went even further to suggested maybe the deep state is what took down to a President Kennedy I don't yeah Sam you got any thoughts on that\nA while I'm not a subscriber to that theory for ... I don't ... I I I wasn't working the case but I've I've never seen anything that's that suggest that\nYea hum maybe just in general how long has the deep state been around I mean I I guess there's always elements inside any government that they might try to undermine it but when ... was there a tipping point where things really just got out of hand the way they're out of hand in this day and age\n... I think who is you know we've we started down this road with the creation of large federal bureaucracies during the depression and that's not me saying that there wasn't a need for that or you know my my grandfather was a new deal Democrat served in Congress he by the way it would not recognize\nToday's Democratic Party media but you know\nWe moved to creating other giant bureaucracies during the second World War and after and then probably\nReally poured jet fuel on the fire in the sixties with the whole idea of the great society and the war on poverty and just the creation of these massive bureaucracies [noise] um\nI one of the things that strikes me as I drive around the country is you know how much money there is in Washington DC you drive into Washington and fifty miles from DC\nYou are seeing vast suburb spread in all directions while the industry of Washington DC is government bureaucracy I mean that's that's money from all over the country\n[noise] brought here and to employ millions of people in the millions more who who live off of the money from them and when you get when you get a bureaucracy that large\nA pretty soon you start to lose control of it again the average men and women in those agencies they're doing their level best on behalf the American taxpayers every day\nNo suggestion otherwise but at the top of that you have some folks who have lost their barracks who now think that they don't take orders they give orders they drive policy they know better than the American people how they should live and that's really scary\nYeah definitely will flow again Sam Faddis greatly appreciate you joining us here in Montana talks ought to check out your ah your magazine a chance to uh the and is it an magazine or a ...\nA A N D Magazine dot com boom check it out we got some good people writing force\nWill definitely do that and stay in touch if you've got other topics that you think are folks back here in Montana will want to talk about here about and\nAnd uh you know I read I read some headline about the Russia investigation and I I started yawning right in the middle of it because it's a case going on you know but uh\nUntil maybe we'll get with the again and and that's those doors probably heat up as the the left gets desperate to try to attack from any way they can once again here so again thanks for joining us on Montana talks great pleasure thank you\nAll righty well we do have on the phone lines with us now I mentioned we've got a story posted on our website news talk nine five five dot com a ballot initiative one eighty five so I one eighty five I don't know if you've seen this but some of the supporters of eye when eighty five\nOr had been trying to claim that I one eighty five will help veterans well why then is the one

think that the two biggest stories today that you're not really going to see or hear about anywhere else\nIn this day right now by and large uh two big stories a first or the chairman of the ... tribe chairman AJ not afraid endorsing the Republican Matt Rosendale for the U.S Senate he basically said I'll play the audio free later the show he basically said\nThe agenda of the Trump administration's the agenda of Matt Rosendale is the agenda of the crow tries to put it succinctly that's exactly what he said I'll play\nAudio for you later today um but also there's another big story out there regarding these ballot initiatives so ah I one eighty five that tax hike measure that would also make the Obamacare Medicaid expansion permanent in Montana\nOr will the backers of I Wonder if I have desperately tried to make veterans a part of their campaign pitch but now one of the states last\nStations is coming out against I went into the American legion of Montana in a unanimous vote\nCame out against I went and he thought I'll tell you why later on it in the show but first up a yeah President Trump coming back to Montana for an unprecedented fourth visit to Montana\nOr no sitting president has visited this great state that many times but it also got me wonder how many times is Donald Trump junior been to Montana I'm kind of hoping he's he's looking to buy property and move here full time\nBut anyway uh uh please now to be joined on the phone lines are by senator Steve Day and he was on the bus and they did this big bus tour across the state with Donald Trump junior Kimberly ... a Rand Paul painted on the end of it as well senator days great to have you here on Montana talks\nA thanks so much air and it was such a treat to have\nA Donald Trump junior and Kim Il foil a traveling with his across Montana as well Senator Rand Paul and his sweet wife Kelly standing I Would just privileged to to spend time with them on the bus and hitting places\nStarting up in ... fell down a romance Missoula the Hamilton just was a great day and uh so nice that Donald Trump junior would come back to Montana let me tell you some he\nAbsolutely loves the state in fact the\nCity I just had breakfast with Donald Trump do this morning and and can we put them on the airplane as they are heading North Dakota here this morning to help out Kevin Cramer that important to US Senate seat in North Dakota Kevin and I were elected to gather to U.S House of two thousand twelve\nAnd Kevin is now running for that important Senate seat in North Dakota looks like a good pick up seats opportunity for us\nI was gonna say 'cause I noticed a President Trump is on the trail obviously you know another stop editor I write in your backyard there at the ... grade\nUm buddies making all the stops are actually is I think are wrapped them all up you know Columbia, Missouri Fort Myers Florida Huntington West Virginia Indiana Bozeman, Montana Macon Georgia Chattanooga, Tennessee all these places he's not going to North Dakota so it sounds like that's how strong\nThe races looking for Republican Senate picked up in North Dakota right now than the president is is not even including that on his on his final week rally less buddy is including Montana I was chatting with Rachel settled from Fox News radio and she believes also that this was a clear sign the President Trump believes the Republicans can win in Montana\n[noise] well a Donald Trump is very popular in Montana and the the unprecedented to think that this will be his fourth visit to our state a sitting president to our great state four times in over a period of less than Ninety Days is just remarkable era but we're we're thrilled to have them come back\nOr for those who are listening others tickets available you go to Donald J Trump dot com and then you could look at the there's a link there talks about upcoming visits and\nAs you mentioned Aaron ... gosh he's got six or seven or eight more visits plan before election day just go to Belgrade, Montana the reason that says ballot great versus Bozeman\nIs because that's going to be an airport rally like we saw happen in Missoula that was such a special night\nTo the air force one there with that beautiful Montana found sets guy in the background the turning around and looking at this guy's they now and go why they call this place big sky country well similarly you think about the backdrop will have for the president hopefully we'll have the weather that day and you look back at the beautiful bridger mountains\nIt should be a gorgeous day for a rally and it'll be in one of those hang around with like we did them yeah thirty Yemen but was well actually Belgrade officially the airport there\nThat's going to be a big one yeah you're right you'll ... you'll have your some of your favorite of hiking trails right behind you there for the for the rally right here just like I got to see so you know blue mountain in Missoula where I was hiking around in my college days and so yeah that can be it's gonna be another incredible rally\nTrump should hammer home this Saturday I mean really we're one week until the election here in across the country was the one point the brain injured amoral\nYeah well gosh you know oftentimes they say there's no such thing as a silver bullet silver buckshot is it's a number of things to talk about to boil it down to a a a closing message but I tell you that that that Kavanaugh's vote Aaron released or Montanans up it it stirred\nA Americans up coast to coast in terms of\nThe president's a standing with ... great judge or the Republicans the U.S Senate standing with that great judge in and watching the Democrats go to a really a search and destroy mission trying to destroy human being but you know there was another story that doesn't get as much attention but\nWas a very disturbing that's what happened to certainly to Ronny Jackson and I think the president or with all of our veterans out there and Aaron you are a veteran a thank you for what you have done for our country\nContinue doing using only served out there listening you know ... well grateful\nRight and and I you know you're talking about your days in Missoula going way back I\nMy mom was seven months pregnant with me in Missoula working at the Missoula ... putting a young marine on my dad's through school there uh once upon a time in Nineteen sixty two so I'm grateful for that legacy in our family but the the veterans are very very important\nVoting population in Montana and I continue to hear a veterans concerned about what happened to Ronny Jackson\nThis later out of the great falls area but anyway it as a member of the American legion and he's been a key leader in the American legion or he took part in this vote I think it was last weekend if I'm not mistaken anyway basically they had a unanimous vote of the American legion of Montana opposing\nBallot initiative one eighty five opposing I one eighty five\nI'm so here's the deal so why is it the American legion of Montana one of the state's largest veterans organizations coming out against I one eighty five that's the the measure that would raise tobacco taxes and then also make permanent the Obamacare Medicaid expansion\nNow he said that the American legion wasn't taking a position on Medicaid expansion but what they're concerned with is with regard to the tobacco taxes here here's the here's the response from\nA department commander Richard close of Laurel he said our members concerns are multiple\nThe greatest issue is the negative impact this initiative would have on future funding of our veteran hopes additionally degrading the veteran home funding priority is of great concern or you could see the full statement from the American legion of Montana\nA on our website Go to Montana talks dot com I and if we have time all share more of that information with you later in this show but of course we do want to take your phone calls the phone lines are open for you for oh six\nTo nine four zero nine Seventy and it's really anything and everything you want to talk about it doesn't have to be about the elections coming up in a week it could be about\nSomething else frankly a bus regarding the elections coming up here in uh in just a week\nBig news over the weekend in Lewis town Sunday afternoon we got a caller from Lewis town who said yeah the the chair of the crow tried in doors to Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosen is big news tabby tribal leader endorsing the Republican Senate candidate\nUm and then
