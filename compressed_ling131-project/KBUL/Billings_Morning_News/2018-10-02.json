Yellowstone electric to this although grew from there so folks from all across Montana that are gathering here in great falls um but one of the collapse it said that I understand is facing some concerns in northeast Montana and and you think about it from a billings perspective\nThere there's a lot of you know engineers and in other jobs and businesses in buildings that are based in billings\nBut they do work all across Montana on on some major projects will they got a major project that they're working on\nA ... ... outside of multiple uh now joining us here on Monday and it's also got Gretchen boardman the manager for big flat electric and Gretchen you're also a a Malta natives and Montana tech alum as well so good to have you know\nThank you it's good to be here\nYes to tell us about this project you're trying to get up and running outside of Malta\nSo we're trying to put in a hundred and Fifteen K v line just basically east of Malta\nRunning roughly from whitewater to say go to get our members north of say go all the way over to the um the LA county line north of ... and then whitewater lowering tickets to get them better service and\nMake sure that they were able to hold that loading capacity right now the lines\nWhat are lowering tickets to get them better service and\nMake sure that they were able to hold that load and capacity right now the lines and stuff that we have can do the job relatively speaking but um we are not able to service it as well as we would like to\nSo we're currently working on doing that and Philips county is all in general habitat or core habitat with the sage grouse and it is a major concern for us we have put in one route specifically\nSubmitted it to the sage grouse team\nAnd we did get some not official scoring per se but roughly our mitigation costs for non nesting facilitating\nStructures and since we're in general habitat will be a little over two million dollars and\nI were very very small co-op which a lot of them are in especially in rural rural Montana like we are and more cows than people for sure for sure\nAnd I'm with that ... with having a eleven hundred members roughly our membership would have if this went through and you know all this end up being roughly Nineteen hundred and forty three dollars of member\nNow I don't pay for sage grouse habitat and I use their clothes because some of us have questions about will really help say droughts habitat or not or is this just a money making venture but the way that's a big cause right life no matter what the outcome is\nThat's exactly right you know um [noise] this is all just potential you know obviously there are ways that they're the sage grouse team is making it that we can try to mitigate lower costs they're looking at some waivers they're looking at some um ... you know just different things that they're they've really been well\nEspecially the last few weeks helping us try to avoid this because they understand the financial burden it would be to our members and how big a deal it really would be\nBecause it's a mitigation cost I'm not exactly sure how we could finance that I I ... we just got the numbers friday so I had not had time to really look at it\nI shouldn't say I got the numbers right about what had my meeting on friday yes gives me on that and um so I haven't had a chance to talk to our financial borrower right now but because it's just a ... a liability there is no asset so I'm not sure if we could advertise that over a course of the year\nOr multiple years so if we had to do it you know it's a big expense to our members\nSo that yeah Mitt imagine if your power bill was going to go up by about two thousand dollars I mean that's the way to break it\nDown and write us roughly a hundred and sixty bucks a month\nYou know for many young Lee yeah go ahead you're on that note about\nThe ... on the about the cost of you know rural\nMontana the lower incomes are not very high a lot of people who are pretty strict are struggling\nAnd I saw this or heard the statistics that are sixty percent of Americans don't have the money to handle a five hundred dollar emergency sixty five percent don't have a thousand dollars even a thousand dollars in savings so I mean just imagine what this costs a grudge and talked about what that would do to people\nIn your theory is because obviously this is something that's a concern for big flat electric mall to\nNow you know I think folks in the billings area and elsewhere across Montana will be concerned 'cause they do business up in that neck of the woods and they don't want to see their fellow Montanans get hit with a high cost like that but this could also set a precedent so when when you know when Yellowstone wants to put a new project on line when you know folks in Missoula want to put a new project on line\nAnd we'll now if they lay the groundwork to where they can shake your down for millions and millions of dollars for so called habitat yeah and and you get hit with this huge rate hike ... and I\nWant to emphasize that it's not that the electric cooperatives do not care about birds because for example just a couple years ago we we became the electric off Montana became the first a group of electric utilities in a single state to a ...\nWe became the electric off Montana became the first a group of electric utilities in a single state to a ... of the United states to jointly develop a bird protection plan to prevent against ... and then you know harming the birds\nSo and that was accepted by the U.S fish and Wildlife Service in fairly rigorous review about ... ... you know we do care about the birds and start hurting those birds so\nYeah yeah so this this project is there a name for this project or for for folks to watch her or anything like that or I mean they just have folks want to help out big flat electric maybe contact your local cough and say hey what what can we do to help them out\n[noise] yeah you know I'm right now actually you know we're just in the minimal started the project and my biggest concern is not so much this project in general because we're in we are in general habitat my bigger concern for all ... members that have the electric utilities\nIs the core area and we had um the state's U.S team actually run our same route per se in a court area which will be south Philips County South I'm Blaine county which we also service\nAnd that mitigation goes from two million to over five million and I'm the same not only the line I mean same parameters same you know everything like that that's a

yet another legal battle with California and the Trump Administration the trumpet administration now suing California Africa California passed the country's toughest\nNet neutrality lot Tanya powers

it's not ... the law are within hours at the J had already filed a lawsuit over it [noise] and\nAnd it ... that they travel the law does it was stopped Internet providers from favoring certain content or websites\nUm this trial that he was actually repeal last year um by the FCC is was put in place during the Obama era and so the Trump Administration repealed it and what it would travel the actually did was prevent Internet service companies\nFrom having control over what you watch and see on the Internet and since it was repealed now more power has been given back to the Internet service providers and these big companies they can\nBlock certain ... certain content if they choose to they can slow it down where your pay just don't loaded fast I'm certain ones it doesn't have to

quickly most of us are onto the next thing we're not you know sit there and wait for a page to load unless it's just like super super important um [noise] so that's that's one of the things that this kind of this bill would stop that would kind of restore some of the net neutrality laws that were in place\nBefore they were peel California is not the only doing is the law was more\nExpansive and and sweeping than the other one's Oregon Washington state in Vermont have also approved and air travel the laws that California's went further\nAnd by the way New York also has an identical bill to California but as working its way through the uh the legislative pipeline as well\nWell I Know here in Montana we don't have a a a net neutrality law but but our democratic governor who also wants to be a presidential candidate and twenty twenty\nOr did file an executive order basically basically mandating net neutrality for any tech companies that want to state contracts if I'm summarizing that correctly so are you seeing other kind of back door measures like that executive orders things where maybe they won't have the ... elected lawmakers on their side\nThat might that might be something that we see more of because you know a lot of states don't like the fact that this has been this kind of power has been put back into the hands of of the Internet service providers and out of the

trade agreement a lower asking the Montana grain growers are reacting to this news\nAbout the new agreement with the U.S Mexico and Canada are ... with the Montana ... said that she says quote we're very pleased that the administration is put together a deal with our closest trading partners\nAnd especially that includes language addressing a longstanding issue regarding the grading of wheat delivered into Canada there are a lot of steps yet before a final trade agreement is fully realized but we're hopeful that Congress recognize how important this is to agriculture\nAnd our economy and doesn't allow it to get bogged down in partisans ship so that was an initial reaction there from the Montana grain growers I'm really right in line with what the National Association of wheat growers had to say in response to this is well they're calling this a good agreement [noise]\nUm and and for that Canadian grading issue alike\nSo the Montana ringer as as a following a\nFollowing suit there [noise] um I I've got some other audio clip so I was going to get to when I started off the show around six o'clock this morning I said hey we've got a lot of stuff that we're going to try to get to but we just may not have time\nI just got confirmation Lola Rascoe with the Montana grain growers is going to come join us at the top of the nine o'clock hour from great falls we broadcast from the heritage integrate fall so she'll kick off at nine o'clock hour forest [noise] uh and then we got Alan\nOlson's to Montana petroleum association he's going to join us in just a couple of minutes here on the show up at first step up back in our studios in billings right now I think we got is it that chased Pearson talking about this upcoming dental implant seminar I chased are you there\nI Am how're you doing\nEd doing doing great thanks for holding down the Fort in the studio for me to do problem right well so tell us what you got coming up with his dental implant seminar\nSo uh tomorrow October third at six thirty pm we have a dental implant seminar which were uh [noise] you know talking to people in the community about dental implant and the benefits that they can have other oral health\nSo what I was kind of some of the newer technology that's out there I mean I Know it's it's getting easier it's getting less expensive to get some of these types of employees what what are some of the things that people get get most excited about after they attend one of these seminars stuff that that they don't know from ten or Fifteen Years ago\nYou know ten or Fifteen Years ago did a little bit or fairly new and the main thing that you use them for just a single input teeth\nOr one to replace the option but now you know impasse or being able to what we're calling for like ... patients it will you'll be able to use multiple implants in space to restore the whole ... which is you know newer thing and the a great benefit to people and\nSometimes he'd be kind of amazed at what insurance might actually cover now or\nOr or maybe it's a combination of costs going down plus some insurance coverage so so you know you can do you get to kind of learn a little bit about about that at some of these seminars is well\nDefinitely we were talking about you know financial type things are just people always have questions they will cost is always a big question you know in with anything to do but you know insurance companies are becoming definitely a lot more common for them to help out with the implants\nWith the cost of them because it's becoming more the standard of care you know it used to be just like a bridge you know bridge option to replace teeth but now it has become more of a standard of care interests are helping a lot more with or if it cost if you have do insurance\nAre so give us the details getting when and where it's going to be at and uh and how close to sign up for it\nSo to sign up you can go to our website to sign up or you can get off the call to four five seven zero to six to sign up and it is going to be tomorrow night the six thirty PM at uh our practice office skills family do ten forty five twenty seventh street north\nRight well good deal chase Pearson yeah go ahead\nOr because they you know your your anyone is welcome to come and get away of little appetizers there to start off and just a inform whoever shows up just about the benefits of villain plants and how we can help them out\nGood deal All right well Jason appreciate ya showing up an effort to help them get the word out about this event coming up tomorrow run around the corner yeah thanks so much ... thanks for being with us\nAnd coming up I Know he's he's on his way up is probably riding the elevator up to the top floor of the double tree hotel in downtown billings right now as we speak to a covered down on the studio for us in a in a second I'm oh looks like a Allen Olson is is in Studio right now or did I get that word right Alan are you there [noise]\n\nWhere he's just about on his way in okay well we'll have our producer Travis legal track him down\nAllen also went to Montana petroleum association is going to going to join us here at any second so I'll I'll Wait for a producer Travis lead to give us a word when he is in Studio um yeah but uh yeah he'll be joining us in a second not a key thing we're going to talk with Ellen Wilson about his\nSo there's new rules are that have been proposed\nA regarding hydraulic fracturing and for those of us you know in the buildings area we know that hey\nFracking hydraulic fracturing yeah it's unleashed the potential of the ... and when they were rocket the Bach and thanks to fracking that's what unleash this whole revolution that combined with horizontal drilling\nAnd even though the market may seem you know hours away from those of us in billings there's a lot of folks that are buying homes living in billings but then working based out of the market will maybe their companies are based in building so it's for the propping up a lot of jobs\nBack in the villains area too and so anyway there's these new fracking rules that have been proposed and the Montana but for petroleum association is is supporting these proposed rules\nAnd apparently the environmental groups are are saying that they support these new rules but kind of as expected with these environmental groups it's never enough for them they're still gonna press for more uh Alan ... and are in their\nCrime here our Aaron ... hey doing great thanks for a thanks for joining us in Studio I'm I'm over it in great falls but I I Know you know this neck of the woods pretty well also\nGo God when I was a kid we used to sneak out a hammer and go down in great falls on a somewhat regular basis\nBut I'm not even asking for some of those stories I Know and I'm not I'm not as are I I'm not up for confirmation at the Senate so you can ask me anything you want\nA perfect for\nWe make a bunch of stuff up anyway to make it up and just make up whatever you want a era of politics these days and days so the new fracking rules what's the story here\nWell it kind of goes back here a little over a year ago\nAnd me I see through earth justice filed suit against the board of oil and aboard a oil and gas conservation because they wouldn't go into a room making to disclose a proprietary additives in hydraulic fracturing fluids no these are probably ... ... [noise]\nProprietary additives make up less than a probably a half a percent in in the fracturing fluids itself you know everything else it was disclosed as per rules adopted by the board back in two thousand eleven [noise]\nBut uh we got to talking amongst ourselves and what some of the things that have been going on around the country and what we essentially did is we took a\nA consent decree a out of a out of a court in Wyoming where uh Wyoming chapter of a essentially the northern plains resource council of the Powder River basin resource council an earth justice to the state of Wyoming over disclosure frack fluid chemicals\nSo we took that consent decree that was agreed to by the environmental groups in the state of Wyoming\nAnd we put that into a state statute\nNow we put that into a statute that regulates oil and gas operations in Montana and it does require the disclosure of proprietary chemicals\nAnd service companies have to make the disclosure to the staff at the board of oil and gas but they have this half has to hold that information secret [noise] unless they're a directed by a district court judge to release that to the public\nKnow that those additives can still be released for a emergency ah\nReasons a medical reasons but uh you know we kind of thought that that would take care of a northern plains resource council ... or ... minutes and uh the Montana environmental Information Center and me I see [noise] uh they they were protesting this as well\nAnd you know it in\nA maze me when we had this\nA Senator Tom Richmond carry the legislation last legislative session\nWe were actually the only pro bone and gone on the disclosure [noise] but uh Emmy I see they they still opposed it and they just keep adding more more demands into this uh you know they they want forty five days pre ... notice so somebody might be able to test for these chemicals\nBoil it it's cost prohibitive to test for individual chemicals with what we're pushing on is a baseline water analysis\nWhich is required in Wyoming but is a permit stipulation in North Dakota and you can tell going off to be ah ah the the baseline of if you've had any any issues from from a frack job or or we're drilling procedures so\nIs the robbers I understand it's all these companies when you talk about proprietary information says let's say you're one ... company over another you have a special blend of product that you use is mostly white sand and water and then and then some chemicals\nThat you that you use but actors chemicals and ice cream and if we if we listed all of the chemicals that are in ice cream and told people does you know you're ingesting you know this type of chemical you could scare the heck out of people by telling them just a simple chemical that was an ice cream even\nA matter of fact there is a additive in ice cream that we do using hydraulic fracturing the Florida huh\nThat's what we use a Joe the water to carry the sand it interesting and you find that in ice cream\n... and so so they use that to scare people so what the environmental groups want here's now if you're a private sector company the reason you want to hold on to this information is not because\nFirefighter Raphael Korea from firehouse subs introducing new firehouse pub steak so savory steak crispy fried onions in Oak Ridge Belgian beers cheese sauce on top for

MS might yeah did you hear from me a quick question or comment from you\n\nGo ahead Mike do we get Mike on the phone on their ... I'm not hearing Mike [noise]\nCan we try Brad in Laurel online to see if we get that one working\nYeah [noise] okay go ahead Brent\nYeah my question is for I've been following the Canadian trade agreement on a week and as you might be able to answer my question\nOr one of the big problems we've had an exporting particularly through Canada is that America American grain allow far more help from foreign materials not know about materials\nIn their wheat and while the farmer is docked for in a dirt or couples\nOr weed seeds are found in their brain the large uh uh shippers will actually Brenda and shake it back up to a higher ... am to maximize their profits\nAnd Canadians before they ship but queen it and take that stuff back out so they have a higher reputation in the world\nAre has that been addressed to wear a when we fell on an international basis even shipping through the airport that were not allowed to make our green obey or quality and then complain that we've been blocked and the other question would be\nCanadians are kind of a farm to market\nProducts of the Canadian railroad much draw up all of us rates possible but when American we'd go them it's not considered that so it's charged a higher rate so is are those two things part of the current agreement\n[noise] you know I take the last one first um there are provisions in there I haven't seen the full details of the transportation agreement but there but there are some provisions in there I'm not a grant address some of those transportation issues and we'll take a take a closer\nLook at those I'm On the original question on a on a\nMaterial that has long been a case that that Montana export not Montana by us exporters will sell exactly what the customer buys\nAnd Canada with their practice and cleaning all that crane before it exports have always delivered higher product then what the customer purchases you know I'm not I'm not sure why that is um\nI think it that stemmed from the ... marketing board where\nThey weren't really in\nProducer oriented business um [noise] excuse me they actually paid um paint the farmer an average price instead of going market price and that was not the case in the United states\nMontana wheat in particular has always been known as a blending lead and I don't think that that will change you know we raise a higher protein although Canadian\nComparable quality but I think there will all be always be some of those blending practice and as there's more privatization of of the fleet industry in Canada um as they move further and further away from those marketing for practices I think maybe we'll see some of that change\nAll right well the rest of the Montana ... thanks for taking those phone calls a farm bill from\nShe could have ... so we have the new fiscal year in government terms and that it happened Sunday night so basically the farm bill has expired I Know you know it's a Republican Democrat the bipartisan deal where they want to get the farm bill up and running again but either way it expire what's the what's the approach what's the message from the grain grows at this point\nWell a lot of frustration that we weren't able to get it done in time I'm now we're in kind of limbo [noise] ah the houses out most of October um senators in but\nIt's unlikely that they will come to any kind of an agreement before the election and then we're into the lame duck or there may be may be some change over in leadership they may have to\nUm there may be a change over in chairmanship of the committees so there's a lot of uncertainty that will even get this done by the end of the year we're still holding out hope but not quite there not quite to the point where they want to establish an extension yet\nBecause to them that would mean they're giving up um but there's still quite a few differences our gender differences in the commodity title um as far as bass shaker provisions there's differences in a conservation title on whether to continue CSP as it is or combine it with the equipped um and of course the snap differences or one of the overriding\nBut given the politics right now especially right now or it's pretty much all Calvin all the time you don't expect anything getting done before the November elections maybe not even before the end of the year for her to right there right yeah interesting um in general economic terms obviously the prices have been down for some time now so that's been a concern [noise]\nUm no we did get the good news about about this many U.S Canada Mexico grim if that's still got a ways to go in the process but still a big news this week [noise] generally and you can economically given the fact that you know so many ... have been able to add the pulse crops into the rotational cycles\nHas that at least kind of ... some of these lower prices to where it's you don't feel as much of an economic front\nThat you would have say Fifteen Twenty years ago [noise]\nYeah it certainly helped 'em for those cars that are able to add pulse crops into their rotations for the most part they haven't displaced ... acres [noise] um and they've been putting those on on some or follow acres for the most part so that's added another um another commodity to their economics\nI'm you know there's a little bit of uncertainty right now in the post crops and then they don't work well for all growers either um\nWe're broadcasting live from the heritage in in great falls with Montana talks today and um and actually at the same location is where the annual meeting is going on the convention for the Montana electric cooperative association so\nCo-op members from across the state these are the folks who keep the lights on for you um but you know we talk about this economic growth that's going on right now\nI'm thinking about that from electric co-op perspective you're you're turning on the lights for more and more homes more and more businesses all the time we're talking now with mark hate and he's a general manager from Missoula electric cooperative\nMark yeah what's the growth been like in your neck of the woods in Missoula\nWell Aaron thanks for having me as far as yeah the ... it's been tremendous you know what a difference to a couple of years make um\nTwo years back you know we were we were pretty stagnant growth and uh it's really taken off this year around Missouri\nUm weather's residential commercial um we are definitely seeing an uptick in in the growth and yesterday we attended a you know a manager's meeting here at the at the Montana electric costs conferences and\nUm the story is similar across Montana whether it's ... um people are really seeing growth so good yeah I\nI Know from the billings ... Missoula I Know like for example I've got family that live on the other side or reserve\nThey're technically not in the city property so their co op members are out there and that's a large chunk of the city a lot of homes are out there\nBuildings is moving in the same direction with more and more homes that are standing outside the city limits of huge growth for those electric up and then an eastern Montana and parts of the high line now with the Keystone Pipeline moving through they're going to see some growth to service those projects so so it's kind of happening across the state to a certain extent\nYou've added in that that territory that's historically been co-op territory rural um as the cities are filling up and spilling over into those communities where we're seeing that girl so no doubt about it\nYeah so part of your role here with the uh Montana electric collapse association with ... a year the region nine representative to the national resolutions committee so that's where all the ideas kind of ... things you want to change your ideas to implement right how's that process kind of work\nThat's a fact so so electrical ups are are in forty seven states across the nation and and with more than eight hundred co ops um we have a formal process that that's a kind of determines our our our guide our past and ah and that's our national resolutions\nIt's a representing region nine which is the Pacific northwest if you will Alaska California and Hawaii as well um [noise] so yeah that process is a year long you get kicked off the summer um\nAnd right now we're in the middle of our regional meetings there are a um a number of regional meetings that these resolutions that we bring forward that co ops themselves individual costs spring forward\nAnd and that process is ongoing um and I thought maybe I'd you know with with a number of them to talk about um a new one that we're looking at this yours is generally supporting electric vehicles and an electric vehicle infrastructure\nAnd that's a that's a it may seem a I'm I'm far fetched in Montana and and not necessarily a in in great need right now but we see that trend changing\nSo start building the infrastructure start supporting that type of instructor I Know I've seen a little bit of it to a certain extent I mean whether it's like the Hilton garden and I think in Missoula has a little Tesla Motors type ... charging station I think big timber has won so across the state and you're seeing more of these Tesla vehicles all the time\nYou're correct in in in Tesla has has a pretty well mapped out infrastructure for they're charging stations but that's not exactly true when it comes to non Tesla vehicles and [noise]\nAnd [noise] at ... at the national level we're just a um voicing that support for policies and investments and sent this the production\nOf not only vehicles themselves but the infrastructure needed to support them so [noise] um and if you look at Montana um the department of environmental quality has some VW settlement money that will be um a Porsche which will be used for infrastructure build out and so we're looking at that to say\nHow can that be used to support these rural communities that co ops like those electric serve\nAll right well very interesting stuff mark ... general manager for Missoula electric cooperative I Know you've got to run you've got to meet and going on downstairs right now so don't let us all Jeb thanks for popping in\nHere for a Montana talks good to see her shift thank you very much All right we'll jump on the phone lines now we've got Dave Lewis on the phone long time a Republican legislator but he's he's the numbers guy he's the budget got you got budget questions you talked to Dave Lewis\nA but it wasn't just the numbers guy for the Republicans he was also the budget director under a democratic governor as well or Dave Lewis sorry there\n\nDo get Dave on the phone lines here\nOh okay I got you there and you hear me\nOkay\nTell you what a I Am I'm I'm not able to hear ... or maybe not able to hear me so I Will have are a technicians back in the studio get you get tracking that down of course I'm here\nAlive at the heritage in in great falls out with a live show today getting back out on the road or we are testing at our brand new oil broadcast equipment so we ... we just took some phone calls a few minutes ago so we should be good to go so well\nBut anyway I'll Wait the uh the green light from our team back in the studios to see if we're if we're ready to take Dave's fungal if not I promise you we will get Dave Lewis back on the show here 'cause\nUh we've been getting a lot of phone calls about this I wanted to five so I Know a lot of people have questions [noise] um so if we got to shift the conversation to when I'm back in Studio we can certainly do that\nI'm so we were talking about this new Canada trade deal I've got some some other an audio clip that I wanted to play for as a as I've been broadcasting live from great falls there's been a lot of other news that has been piling up here\nUm for one thing that came out over the weekend we've been talking a lot about this US Senate race coverage here in Montana\nThis much of a Navy SEAL vote rich and back he's a double amputee lost both of his legs in services country in Afghanistan he made in the door Smith in this US Senate race and he came out and endorsed\nMatt Rosendale the Republican or state auditor for the U.S Senate race and he basically said that\nSenator Jon tester is not followed through when it comes to the VA has not follow through and supporting veterans so big endorsement from Matt Rosendale um I'll play the audio for he's got time but I think we do have our our phone lines up and running a day to Day Lewis can you hear me now\nIs going here okay good to go I I got ya so\nHigh one eighty five or what can you tell us that the main question that we've been hearing his folks are saying okay so it raises taxes it's supposed to pay for Medicaid expansion but it's a little bit more complex than that what what are your biggest concerns with I one eighty five\nWell you know my biggest concern is that I don't want tax increase uh we we are for the legislature\nOr left town with the ability to spend Thirteen billion dollars and displaying them from all sorts of federal money saved money your general point of everything else but Thirteen million dollars so out my I've always advocate of setting priorities I don't like to absorb increase the governor says that he was going to stick with the big tobacco\nGroup tobacco doesn't pay the tax the consumer pays the tax so that's not my number one concern or that you know and do we have to look at the possibility we're going to lose business that they will I mean we're going to have a thirty seven dollars a heart attack so long horn on cigarettes\nIt's four dollars or forty cents in North Dakota sits ...\nFive dollars and Seventy cents in Idaho I mean anybody within reach of the borders and to buy cigarettes and Montana are what search for that so I I don't think we're going to get the money that they expect\nA I think it's going to be a real burden on a lot of consumers and I think it without us they got what the legislature to set priorities so they could impact on the program or or\nYou know one of the other things is like for example yesterday here in great falls we had there as far as much or he's not running for the house that joined us and I know he feels that there's some reforms that need to be made to the Medicaid expansion in the past the Montana Legislature and was signed by governor both a few years ago\nBut as I understand that you won't be able to implement those reforms if I Want any five passes because it will basically locked the current plan\nIn place without being able to make any reforms that that might be necessary\nThat's where I I mean it basically gives you the same program they've got no I really think that\nI mean we've covered kids under the chip program a children's health insurance program the disabled are covered under SSI um you know the elderly people what my my cell are on Medicare and so you know I I Would think that uh we're basically looking at a ploy to do\nI think we ought to at least require them to have a job or be going to school I don't I don't think it'll just grew up anybody to get on a the Medicaid expansion and uh you know when we started this thing we thought we were going up forty five thousand people in the Ninety five thousand now\nAnd he turned me off or something and they do pay a preview of what a very small premium but anything they offer a service like Medicaid on the cheap you're going to get a lot of people come and take advantage of it I really believe will have a requirement that they have a job\nOr be going to school [noise]\n[noise] well especially with the job market that we've got right now we've got a very strong job market here in Montana facts heck if you listen to radio stations or when those national programs come on uh most of the you know advertisements are you hearing job recruiters cause there's the strong economy there's jobs are available right now my question is this", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "02"}
