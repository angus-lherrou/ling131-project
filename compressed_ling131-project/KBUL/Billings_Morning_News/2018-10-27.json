Stein distinguished professor of public health that the city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually most people are faced with such high co payments on to the doctor bowls that they are indeed\nTry to have coverage so many of us have policies that have a thousand or even two thousand dollars deductible before the insurance\nKicks in and even after that a lot of policies say you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and a hospital stay can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now and did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar deductible in this country and that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so the doctor balls are rising and co payments are rising and\nAs you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which\nHave helped people but have still left them\nIn deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of six thousand dollars now for most families of six thousand dollar head that comes when you're sick and frankly in danger of losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected but\nHow common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all that what's the average bill for example that's left for someone to pay out of pocket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews ought to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we want to know what are the financial consequences of that\nAnd does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do this really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports just like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies we merged all of those credit report records with\nHospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat stuck or mass you know do we do do associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also co author of this study which search millions of hospital in financial records he\nSays there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise but the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well\nWe do see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average\nMan their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with the ... and co payments on their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis they had was that some individual just might not understand exactly what they need to pay or there could be ongoing disagreements about exactly what they need to pay and some of those disagreements might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency\nHowever is a little different for those without insurance and the average patient is in the hospital for five days or so according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and no till would did go says they're hit with higher unpaid bills as you'd expect yet it something else that hurts them the most financially\nAfter going to the hospital if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills and most of that almost all of it goes away if you are in short but whether you're insured or on ...\nAffected by a hospital admission in terms of their labor earnings\nTheir earnings declined by about twenty percent on average and that lasts for a number of years so it takes quite a while for people to go back to normal and for many people we also see some evidence that they ended up retiring early claiming Social Security earlier and in some cases even applying for disability insurance\nNo till we did go says that the most ... finding of this study it's not medical bills that put the average family under financially when they're sick\nFor many people it seems difficult for them to return to work after they go to hospital and you know once we saw that it's not really that surprising I mean for some individuals when they go to the hospital's a serious\nEvent it might make working more difficult there might be short term or even long term disability maybe it's not so surprising but it's not something we were thinking about it ahead of time which is just that after you go to the hospital and suffer\nSome kind of health shocked that so serious that you end up needing medical treatment people return to work slowly and they end up experiencing earnings losses reductions in income for them and actually for their entire household that persists for many years\nIn many ways he says the labor dislocation after major illness looks like a town where the major industry has suddenly closed\nAnd everyone loses their job and then they have to go back and try to find work in many of those case studies people take a long time to get back to where they were before and I think what was surprising to me it's just for how many people that looks very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\n... says that's a major reason debts that occur during a medical crisis or potentially much more damaging and lasting vendetta from things like credit cards everything falls apart at once\nIt comes at a time that's the worst time in your life so sheer gravely ill and running up big medical bills that's a time when your earnings are going down at the same time that the bills are coming in and of course\nThe stress of illness and the disaster of illness\nIs coming up the same time and for medical bills are coming yeah so that's different from buying a house or running up a bill on your credit card for other things and the other thing that's different about it is that we know that it's stopped people from getting the care that they need and that that can have\nMortal consequences so people who are afraid of their medical bills delay\nYour hormones aren't balanced\nIt's going to have some effect and creating some kind of a burden to your system [noise]\nWe found that ... and ... the delivery of those messages to all the organs that are affected and as a result we think it's a great complement to your body let's put it that way\nBut how do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance or not it's hard to say but even if you doubt many she says ... supplements are still safety is\nThe concept of overdose doesn't apply to a certain number of things right\nAnd it turns out that you just can't eat enough vegetables\nTo poison yourself on vegetables we've never even seen that before my goodness we've actually seen people drink too much water and actually poison themselves with water but we've never seen in individual eat so many vegetables that they poison themselves on vegetables it's just not possible\nAnd this is the the safety factor of the ... poly means\nThese are things we normally debt in plants and in the plants that we need the most so we have no toxicity level to them if we're eating or vegetables and we're taking the policy means we're still not going to have an overdose circumstance will just be more stress resistant more bullet proof when it comes to\nThe stress that we face every day\nThe key factor many people don't realize that they do or don't

a drug it's a supplement then Darrow says supplements operate under FDA rules that generally prevent manufacturers from saying much about them\nAnd certainly there are barriers that the FDA has put in place obviously their interest is safety\nAnd with a supplement their interest again is basically safety\nAs far as making claims we can claim that we've been able to help assist promote but at the same time you're correct there are certain disclaimer that obviously the FDA has in place that prevent us from really\nGetting the real total message wrote there as to what the product couldn't

Gotcha for like five minutes let's clean up the landscape checklist for home improvement I got a checklist for\nEverything in my life that they didn't used to do worse what's a checklist is why I Do walk around the house yeah I'll have to get that post like just posted hours today really on our website run your own leader no view we usually do in that same to okay and it's a nice little\nChecklist of just walking around and it's just like you're doing water around the yard start checking off things some things have already been done\nPlus a just walking around and it's just like you're doing wander around the yard start checking off things some things have already been done and you may not to do everything that's in there but it's a nice checklist to follow along and see what's a over the next several weeks 'cause you know darn well you're so in\nThat after next Thursday after next Thursday\nUs are you're you're focused starch the blinders start to come on oh yeah and we start thinking about what holidays jerky man stuffing and Christmas Prozac with what's outdoor eighth and that's the way I Know how do the painting in the spring how do the gutters do it now I'll plant that tree next year\nNow's the time to do all that stuff here taking care of so you know it's not\nToo early there it's not too early to just go ahead and disconnect those from the faucet get that in the garage no no yes no you know am I going to rain next week I disagree on around a lot a hose\nIs the last thing I put away when I take it off now [laughter] I might have a real\nThing while we're talking about if you're listening to us in you're in a you know South Carolina you don't have to take your hat or you're listening to us in Connecticut probably a good idea to disconnect\nThough is just disconnected my point is don't put it away why is that because we need water if you don't get rain fall right up until a holiday season especially newly planted trees and shrubs and evergreens at the top of the list Mother Nature and take care of them are on we hope so but you don't know that so you leave the host the two last tools I find a way\nTo know everything you do the most part you know what I can understand why you didn't get to brighten up better uh this morning I liked the gloomy okay I'm going to\nBe ahead well there you go to a day and they're all ...\nThere's a reason why it's gloomy outside Gary demanded he demanded it stay gloomy so now I'm telling you that your house with a shovel way and the hose away those are the last two things at the end of the year where do you need your shovel\nBecause you can plant and plant plant and if I happened to me the first run on my bucket list and I then I plant and I keep a shovel available and then I keep the hose they're accused in either one of those plants in or water ever reach if Mother Nature doesn't come through\nBut I have ... disconnected from the faucet because there there are some nights it get below freezing\nAnd and\nAnd I got you know you're going to start I'm without ... giving and you're going to get out was\nConnected and even though it's a frost proof faucet that supposedly not going to freeze and split that hoses connected all that water now hosts will still back during the pipe that water will freeze and it will split walnut\nWrong I I I raised my aunt admit that Gary solvent I said hey you're talking all the time in the fall reminding folks reminding you to take that off and then Who Forgot that would be you can run [laughter] how's your plumbing\nBy the way you get all that I had you don't have a whole new frost free flaws that now they have this type of shut off which we didn't have before inside the house and the base but now you shut that off inside which I don't really need to but I have it there in case something new and you know what even if you shut it off\nOn the inside and you didn't connect your host gets what ... is still freezing split with it\nWell unless you had the um do you have a little ... on it but what if I just opened it up and well on ... on this shut off inside the house no okay so if you shut it off right and you open up the leader of al ... back drained\nYour entire host and your entire pie yeah then it wouldn't freeze and you can leave your turn it off inside and then just open up the faucet\nNot take the water out and draining out that way not just the hoses in a big caught in a bad guy and him back into the faucet got its just stop that voucher would have been struggling I'm not going to leave it attached\nWalk my

minutes after the top of the air you're at home with Gary Sylvan take your calls regarding you got to\nYour home so let's get back to work by the way at the bottom of the hour we're going to talk about back up some pumps my golly if you haven't got one yet you are\nWell you're playing Russian roulette with your house especially if you've got to finish lower level and there's always a question I'm asking is a better with the battery backup or water ribbon backup pumps that will be discussed with their friends from ... at the bottom of the in the meantime your calls will get to Betty Betty welcome\nGarry yes why why why why not sure how much around here but we have\nOn the back of the things that\nCame out here now any problems with that I started getting into the pan\nOut here in\nThe show that way and he's like a metal hit\nAnd he come out at trial every day at the same way yeah\nAnd that's where the money but we don't know what I\nCan only I only have\nOne and when was that edition with that type or roof installed seven years ago\nThey had the chance so have you contacted them\nThat that that printed out and out of death hit hard\nYeah yeah so you're a little bit between a rock and a hard place I totally get how\nThe other issue a tribute to the addition issue also but it sounds like\nYou are to problems with two separate types of roof so you you had a problem with the main route that was probably exacerbating the problem with the addition\nAbove we got that resolved and now we're working on the addition and every time we seal one seem a lo and behold the next seem over begins the leak so has the roof or that you're working with and God Bless him he's been pretty thoroughly taking care of the problem\nHas ... has his a gesture at all been maybe we need to cover that\nRight\nRight right right and that was also one of the things I was going to suggest is maybe some of this problem started with last year as hurricane [noise] or she has this\nMy right [noise] uh [noise] Mm [noise]\nYeah [noise] um you know I I so might drawback because I Can't even see it so I I you know I'm just listening to you I say it seems like\nIf the roof if the water is coming from uh the sky and not from that other room\nOr the the um the solution would be to take the seams and maybe even put a coating over that entire roof in the last the Mary coating but I I Can't even see to tell you what kind of roof you have on that or you know four seasons room or whatever\nA year have by that\n[noise] [noise]\nRight but it sounds like those seems need to be all taped and it sounds like\nThere does need to be a ceiling foot over the entire roof and [noise]\nThe problem really isn't a matter of how you're going to fix the problem is finding the roof or to fix it [noise]\nAnd uh the unfortunately that part I'm not going to be able to help you with that yeah if it's if it's solving the problem [noise]\nOr by taping the panels [noise] I think we got our answer [noise]\nAlright coming up next we'll talk back it up some palm sure at home with Gary Sullivan [noise]\nAnd you don't have a good question skin area call wanting hundred eighty two three times I can

comes into different versions that comes in a in an active or a non active active is the why five option which we talked about\nAnd mark I know you're um some palms or rolls sold through plumbers right right and that's the network and\nI think you know some people may just earnings a Gary ... how can some poems take a half hour to explain it because there's a lot going on here right and even in picking a primary pop you got you got choices\nRight so you're some pomp is until I got in his business and they were able to identify myself bumping my right and actually and so there's a lot of ah um it's kind of your head and ally right you know we talked about moisture on the on the show today and keeping washed her out of your basement\nAnd um you know we we like to think we make a good one we're proud of of what we do are known for quality you come to our plant and Louisville, Kentucky and there's um check 'em after check on on on quality so [noise] um we like you know we we we think we we make a good one and tried to provide that peace of mind for our\nCo host training plumbers too because here's folks here's one of the reasons okay if you how far is that\nPumped pumped from the well up the wall out the house\nAll that's got to be configured that's why you're selling quality pumped through plumbers\nRight so the way we're set up a distribution wise as we sell through or we have we have a great network of plumbing distributors throughout the country that sell mainly to plenty contractors remodel ours those types of folks that are skilled and and are able to install primary sometimes battery backup systems and and then the other products we saw\nAll batteries aren't the same either for the better that you\nKnow they're not uh we we recommend a a a wet cell type battery there's different variations of that um that you can get on our website is W. W. W. seller pumps dot com to to learn more about that\nHow long what's the lifespan of the pomp and then what's the lifespan of the battery backup pumps yeah that's a\nGood question so on our primary some palms we like to say seven to ten years but you got a careful with that because it really depends on the application it really depends on how much water you have in your house if you sit on\nThe ten years but you gotta be careful with that because it really depends on the application it really depends on how much water\nYou have in your house if you sit on the Web sit on a hill and you have a some pomp and it runs you know occasionally are consistently it's probably going to last longer if you're living on a spring and that pumps running you know twenty times an hour then it's gonna last less so okay yeah so like everything else some more choose the less it's\nGoing to last yeah and the thing I'd I'd ah you know kind of qualifier recommend there is just to keeping an eye on it is is to pick your head into that some well every once in a while just to make sure that\nUm the water level is below the float right and that everything's ready Doppler testing your existing pump is always a good idea right yeah so we recommend um and this is something really you can\nYou can do on your own or have your plumbing professional due to what we try to do\nIs I mean first of all you want to make sure you're pumps plugged in right right 'cause sometimes you got to make sure it's plugged in a non gee if I write\nAnd I've got a sixteen year old boys and if they want to charge their\nTheir uh well the phone's more foreign and ... and or you want to know these are up and out of that is going into the wall that happens\nYeah the only market like I'll get smarter right [laughter] and then um you want to kind of look check the pet for debris and sometimes to break it down in ... your gutters you can ... leaves in two weeks and I saw it all ties together at all does\nSo I'm going to make sure you're discharges is or you make sure the pumps there's not anything um debris that clog the pomp\nAnd also want to check we recommend you put a a three sixteenth a recall we pull ... when it's installed into this charge by right um and make sure that that we pull is I'm clear clear or if not you could get what we call era locking your top stops\nYeah an interesting guy emailed me today and said do all pumps Nina we pull my other pump didn't have one but this one's making a racket and I go if it's making a racket and you don't have a ... put in a way people\nWrite three sixteenth yep
