made it or you know there's always day to day you're going to go to a better coming up I'm like what is that we're\nOver there quite a bit awkward one was hurt started a company and we really found are kind of place in the market started out as a farm raised ... small operate in a I'm going to go on with them or what we found was that\nAnd quickly but they didn't want to do the marketing the production or any of that they just wanted to harm\nOn article there are better at it than we were so ah we have now claimed up a group of farmers could call it a network of partner farmer and they do there are raising the purple or recruiting more and more farmers every month\nOr on how we buy everything off of them at a very reasonable quite a father who are probably getting a little bit above market right now\nI'm ... up the market here on the ground so they have the support public arms and all of our we\n... all types of products are you making here I mean I mentioned the or the chocolate chip cookie made out of crickets a law is an offer is an offer humans is some of it for for animals to tell us about your product line\nEverything that we may cause for human consumption\nOr the animal the pet food marketers actually regulated quite a bit\nDifferently and throw in the state of Montana were not allowed to do to our products for pet tree\nWith I think this crazy sanity pres yeah I mean many of the animals that we want to who met our customers are going to the food that they naturally for the department of agriculture said that they do not want that for that right now and go do we pick who per phone there's that's how it is\nThis is on ten a department of agriculture\nThat correct wow huh and so\nYou know we we need to see some of these changes because it's a fantastic food source I'd just like ... or for chicken um and so but everything that we do right now is with a human consumption in mind and so we take the crickets dehydrate them and\nWe sell them old or flavored for Reagan mailed the crickets down into the powder that powder people using baked goods shakes movies officers anything you can put a powder and really and then of course we sell or chocolate chip cookies which is what we're probably best known\nCuisine is kind of like a protein powder right basically\nYeah as it's about two thirds protein in that powder so extremely high amount of protein or it has two times the iron compared to beef and that's before you de hydrate them so it's about eight times the amount of iron compared to a stake in that powder\nAre excellent source omega three fatty acids have about forty three times the omega three compared to beef or so it's it's just an extremely nutritious and environmentally sustainable source of food\nWell so so where are you get ... where's your customer base where are you selling all your products where is your biggest customers that [noise]\nWe sell most of it online through a website ... crickets dot com\nAs well as on Amazon or what we have about sixty retail locations this last summer we did a test to really push out and figure out how people respond within the market and so we're getting ready to go to

where Montana\nHey speaking of Missoula this is a kind of a crazy story of this on our news talk nine five five dot com website here a new stock Ninety five point five and a a nine Seventy ... so um\nHave you heard that they've got a a you know Missoula has been like it's like the the Palm Springs vacation spot for for homeless it's in Missoula just loves to attract the homeless population there so\nUh so what what's happened now is they've been attracting you know the homeless population to Missoula whether it's through government programs or things like that or just allowing these large in camp meant to take place is that they'd had a whole pile up of trash\nOr like for example have you ever driven was really across the reserves Street Bridge over there by the Walmart and which is also by the sewage treatment plant kind of has a pretty bad smell do it well down there by the river a underneath the bridge there's um it's that they've just allowed huge homeless encampments to take place there\nSo they went in and had to pick up trash from their\n... how much trashed you think they had to pick up from there it's literally by that tons\nTons of trash that they had the poll from this Missoula home a homeless camp along the Clark Fork\nRiver thirty five volunteers attempted to clean up this past week but they had trouble because they can't get in there with a lot of vehicles and things like that so that ... hall it out but anyway uh Travis Ross with the health department of Missoula valley water quality district said\nWe don't have a weight yet on the amount of garbage but my guess is one to two tons of what they were able that's just what they were little pull out that's not everything that was in there\nHe says we average four to five times per year and some of them has been as high as sixteen last year was twenty five tons of garbage\nFrom one homeless camp in Missoula alone All right well that's just a homeless camp in Missoula what about\nWhat about this idea for Yellowstone National park heard about this through our friends with a Fox News radio\nUh or we're going to see the world's first no waste vacation in Yellowstone so hey you know people going to Yellowstone National park they want to they want to Pakistan and pack out well hey you don't even need to pack out they don't wanna\nThey don't want to have a bunch of garbage they don't want to have a bunch of trash so apparently this is a new idea and natural habitat adventures announcing the world's first zero waste trip on the phone lines to talk about this\nBenji back or with the American conservation coalition ... thanks for being with us this morning\nIt's MORNING right to be here yeah so tell us about this I mean you don't mind here in Montana course ... you know the gateway to Yellowstone National park and we we know about the concept pack in and pack out but there is even more to that concept with this ah this new idea for a yellow stone travel adventure what's his story here\n[noise] yes I think there are stories across the board about climate change other environmental topic people often get lost or getting about Lucian and our natural areas\nClimate change and other environmental topics people often get lost forgetting about\nPollution and our natural areas\nUm and obviously pollution in cities is bad\nI'm In Seattle and I I can relate to a lot of the same problems that you just talked about with um with the homeless population and just other people are put in the area but it's pollution and natural areas that really hurts wildlife I'm an ecosystem more than anything else and so this this this company natural habitat adventures\nUm announced their first a zero waste trip for the first zero waste a vacation\nIn the United states and basically they will be reducing their ... or reducing reusing recycling Ninety nine percent of the waste on the trips and the remaining one percent will be kind of left as a a showcase as to how much people\nHow how much plastic and pollution actually is so that one percent what kind of be left in showcase\nFor people to look out and see is kind of like a token I'm ... and chemists and eyesight into how bad this problem really is it's really great because people who go on those vacations tend to love the environment care about the environment and take\nCare of the environment when you go out and go on a hike or or just to to or Yellowstone National park uh but now there'll be able to not only care about the environment but actually act on it as well while they're taking their vacations\nHave you heard how they actually intend to do it for some of the techniques that do use to to have you know just one percent of their leftover trash at the at the end of the entire triple what techniques do you think that we use\nWill uh\nSome of the big ones are are\nMaking sure that things are compost it a lot of times the problem is leftover food on these on vacations is one of the biggest problems people tend to indulge in and eat a lot of food and but a lot of it's also leftover and so they're going to be composting a lot of the food and then additionally\nFrom recycling is is another big one I think one of the problems that you see a natural areas is that you'll find plastic water bottles\nUm or or beer cans or other types of cans are scattered across the place and I I was actually in Yellowstone about a year ago and I I mean it's not like blatantly polluted but there are those recyclable kind of all over the park and um it really wouldn't be that hard for people to just go out and and take it up so\nUm so it was just basically being a little bit more conscious and that\nWay and making sure that people actually are actually do it and they're they're partnering up with other companies to I'm kind of actually recycling here in the states and and make sure that it happens um and then of course uh some of it [noise]\nAh some of the one percent that's leftover I'm like I said are all these showcased in with their company on other chores to to kind of show how how much they're actually is even with just one percent are being kept\nYeah so who is the idea that then then okay they they would actually uh I guess a a mulch up some of the left over food things like that they would do that during the trip and then figure out a way to to\nRecycle it in the ground kind of like a sled trench per se the human waste shall we say or [noise] or is the idea that they would basically pack out the trash and recycling et cetera once they get done with the trip them once they reach in another location actually has the recycling infrastructure\nYeah they'll do afterwards and I believe that they're using local composting efforts though I'm so they they are doing that there I'm In the area um I'm not exactly sure if it's in the national park but I Do believe that it's local whereas the recycling\nBut they they definitely will be doing that they're using more local and\nRegional facilities instead of sending it overseas to China which you know it was one of the bigger issues with some of this recycling a problem it so that can't be lost and this is kind of the importance of\nTen is the most powerful voice in talk radio Rush Limbaugh followed by Dave Ramsey Sean Hannity after new starting it for and Glenn Beck from seven

thing\nLocal news every ten minutes and when it breaks sisters long talks with Aaron flip on news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\nThere's another story out there that we haven't talked about yet this morning or another ah Montana focused story here\nEspecially with the elections coming up absentee ballots are going to get mailed out this Friday early voting those already be gun if you show up at the county elections offices of course the military and overseas ballots already went out probably or many of those have already been returned at this point\nUh but uh yeah there's this story out of a ... a couple of different angles to this but but first here's here's a story that that you may not have heard about yet so\nSome of you might have gotten some of these fliers uh sounds like more dirty tricks from these a liberal special interest groups here um and and there's a number of angles we can take as we look at this story here but ... that's a great falls Tribune has one story I've seen some other reporters across the state or tweeting about this\nBut apparently this there's this absentee ballot a flyer that that was sad\nAnd she's gotten hundreds hundreds of calls about this flyer phones are ringing off the hook\nAnd so basically it looks like more dirty tricks here by these liberal special interest groups but I'm so who is behind this thing ... and it may leads people to believe that that they're not registered to vote the apps and tea\nUm anyway they just ... very much confuses the process of course is leading to hundreds of phone calls at the ... elections office but who is behind this apparently this absentee ballot a mailer that went out is from the new American Jobs fund\nOr would you according to their website is filled direct with a great falls Tribune rate rights here it's a joint effort of the United steelworkers and the league of conservation voters\nQuote it is focused on large scale voter persuasion and mobilization in critical federal races across the country\nAre so so that's what they're saying here in August the group announced it was starting a an effort with an initial investment a three point one million dollars to support Democrats including a tester here in Montana Alyssa Roberts of the league of conflict conservation voters said the flyers went up to Ninety thousand butter state wide\nAnd a and they're trying to get people to vote for John tester so some dirty tricks going on here here's the deal though aside from the fact that that there's this little these liberal groups that are doing some the sending out at the very least confusing\nA mailers here or ... or ... here's the other thing that's interesting but why in the world or the steel workers\nTeaming up with the league of conservation voters again this goes back to I I think it was former congressman Denny Rehberg who coined the phrase a several years ago over a decade ago and he talked about the unholy alliance\nBetween the labor unions and the environmental movement I mean the league of conservation voters\nNo friend to any union jobs that are out there unless you're just some government employees that just wants to file lawsuits to block timber projects or wants to come up with new environmental initiatives to block new mines from coming up and running here in Montana\nOr unless you want to shut down coal strip a you know hey by all means team up with the league of conservation voters buzz but but this just goes to show again how often times some of these these unions and their political operatives\nFor those of you who missed it in the six o'clock hour earlier this morning we had a chance to catch up with the ah one of the founders of cowboy crickets have you heard a cowboy crickets cowboy crickets dot com they literally started it's a it's a husband and wife team\nThey both served in the coast guard he still serves a now in the Montana Army National guard\nBut they they came up with this idea and they started their their own company they started up a cricket farm they're farming crickets girl I Wonder if that gets very noisy at all or not but anyway that they got a cricket farm out in Bozeman\nAnd they started creating a these like cookies made out of crickets and other almost like protein powders or because apparently crickets are so rich in protein and iron content\nAnd you don't elsewhere across the world yeah people eat bugs like it's like a delicacy is why what they do but you know back here in the states is like kind of a foreign concept to us but\nBut they're cowboy crickets thing ... it's been taken off and they got now they got cricket farmers all over the place\nSupply and bugs for them to turn into food products so had I had a great chat a with a with the with the guy from cowboy

here in ...\nAnd then we have about three speakers that we're going to do a fireside chat system of today is a pretty inspiring it's really all about the life cycle the entrepreneur so we're going to have a an idea stage chat talking about you know how do you take this crazy idea that you'd probably came up with your buddies basement and and really actually communicate it\nAnd turn it into a business and then we're going to go into okay great I created this business I a make a leak\nBut now what how do I balance that's with a full time job or with my family are my kids and how do I even begin to get customers and what does that mean for me personally and the stress that comes with starting a business\nUm and then we're really going to hear from pretty some inspiring local uh entrepreneurs and congressman jak grand Jim ... story in his entrepreneurial journey which for me is extremely inspiring\nI'm and I'm really excited to hear how you can really go from your buddies they sent to a multimillion dollar company that you know sold oracle and what that looks\nLike and and and then taken I really going to bring it home and do what we do\nBack to your uncle lives and fire equipment connect the local community to each other people who are already doing this and the local community people who want to do this and the local community people who want to help them do this and the community\nUm and real during the entire story full circle around that that this entrepreneurial life cycle of the journey and when he learned that it's a journey and you learn that you're not alone and you and you respect the process you're more likely to be more successful along the way\nI knew that bunker labs is fairly new to Bozeman\nBut I also understand what they're hoping to expand it even outside of Boston like here in billings maybe elsewhere like Jula Kalispell or even you know other places where they've got a strong manufacturing sector led to Louis Montana for example but\nFirst off for those who maybe have Mr previous shows where we've talked with the bunker labs Bozeman crew from the national perspective\nWhat his bunker labs all about\nYeah the bunker lab is a national nonprofit currently we're in twenty three and counting cities and we help veterans and military spouses starting to grow their business\nWe do that there are core programming um the first program this outlaw slap on line they online program that allows you to take this how do you start a business of course from anywhere in the nation\nOn line from the comfort of your home and then we also have this format with it which is a monthly meet up which we've been doing here in both men\n... earlier this year and that's really focus locally on the community it's led by a local volunteer city leader um you have monthly events where we really are looking to connect to lose interest exactly what I said like who's already\nExcept for who wants to invest who wants to mentor and city leaders job is to really galvanize and bring the communities together around that\nHad idea thing I Love the most about bunker lab is that we're we're not trying to recreate the wheel ration is trying to bring everybody that's already doing great work\nInto together into the same room and we do that do that bunker but mostly every other month for math um with a lot of people have been coming here in bulk and I've had the honor and pleasure of being coming flying and here to host and seemed community\nHas become one of my favorite chapters and one of my favorite places to\nGet out of the big city I\nI Know I Do need to go to that and I'm\nAnd the first one we had a mayor or a child with our ribbon cutting\nA lot of people that are in him all over and I was extremely impressed by other cities in the work that they're doing\nAnd there's a lot of demand I get a lot of emails\nTalking about how we can expand and I'm the person leading the way on that development here in the west coast and it's really just a matter of having this conversation and making sure that we have the local funding in place making sure that we have a volunteer teams in place\nAnd it can properly executed what we do back then that is bringing the community together like just bringing everybody in the room together to to help each other out\nYeah that that's who pointed these events often they're not just about getting veterans or to say hey here's how\nHere's here's what we want to pass along easier so we can assist huge more of that kind of also networking other companies out there to say hey here's some veterans that have started looking to starts a new companies and maybe you guys can partner together with with your company asked\nHow much of it is high tech I Know there's been a lot of high tech to just because that's kind of the ... that's where a lot of the excitement in this day and age as me for a while but it it's not all just high tech startups you don't\nKnow no you know and and I'm ... and the thing that drives like drives me toward funk allies and I I ran the bay area chapter so I come from being a walk and I come I Iran that chapter there the volunteer started out just running the bay area chapter everything out there is is it's it's the same it's like it's all big tech and\nI think that is an important but I also think for people that want to open up a coffee shop open up a shoe store clothing store or\nA bookstore or write a book um our interests too and I think the thing and I love the most ... we're all inclusive to all of that it's not all about big tax and I ... and I says it's really about veterans finding a problem that they want to solve in the world\nAnd having the support to do so and they're number one problem that we all these women transition out in the navy or walk me the navy the military is um you know accept and that works so if we don't go back to our home town in most cases or we don't go in and if we do have a thing for years\nAnd so when we do get back we don't have the same network that we did ask our peers who you know maybe it went to college or started a business out of high school they have these little ... we don't have that and so while we have the leadership skills will team building skills\nAnd the great to do it in and we don't have those relationships and those relationships lead to access to capital and social capitals is probably more important when you're starting a business\nI think the bunker labs separate thing is is like the thing that keeps me up every day is like at every transitioning service member knew that they could walk into a bunker brews in sitting nearby them and get instantly connected to the ecosystem\nUm that's a win because right now twenty five percent of transition service
