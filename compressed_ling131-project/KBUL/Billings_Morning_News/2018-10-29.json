we talk with people who could care less about politics\nUm but but there are some on the left who were refused to come in here\nAnd take a phone call from you they will refuse to come in here and sit

but what what these media outlets really mean by civility is they mean you guys all just be quiet\nYou just stop you just stop speaking up stopped stopped speaking your mind you just need to be quiet

thought was really a wonderful article was written by Susan ... and it appeared in the Montana standard about gold mining\nAnd really I I just I was so impressed with this article because it was so thorough an in depth and it gave you insights about the industry which you don't otherwise no you know you most people\nDon't know some of the ins and outs of any industry which is a what makes you know something like I one eighty six so such a travesty\nBecause it's always presented in such a simplistic black and white way and and\nNo ... water is like okay well yeah nobody saying we don't want clean water here but if you would bring new morning to all it would be a trainer\nAnd and is it for so many reasons and that's what this article brought out was that who knew the there's this little hole facet of mining that involves you know kind of hobby kind of minor you know small time miners\nAre Montanans who are just really into it and they have been going back\nAnd digging through the debris piles of ancient you know like a hundred and fifty year old mining sites\nAnd finding goal because\nThe processes they did back then were not very good and so they're still they left gold in in those piles of debris and over the last seven years this is what her article\nReveals they has sold or they have generated forty five million dollars in gold\nThat they've sold through the golden sunlight mine and I'm ... but the really cool part about that is when they go on to these private property or state property part of the deal is almost always that they will reclaim the sites\nThat otherwise would not ever be be client and so each each site they wind up spending a couple of hundred three hundred thousand dollars in reclamation process and um\nFor a very very real thing the

they've got to go get rid of the ... which is the Jewish people get the hell off our social media\nAnd I also I mean we I think we saw this too that we did we saw that when the U.S embassy when the

statements in so anyway I ... I Want to get your thoughts on that also I Wonder is a certain extent if the Jewish community is just no because they've been under so many\nAttacks for so long while they just numb to it after a while so we're talking with Rob I signed up\nBut really he's a rabbi for for ah for ah the entire Montana Jewish communities and kind of the way I see it's the talk wars right by the time right after this quick break your Montana's off\nThe\nSets Bodner has formally taking the oath of office as president of the University of Montana\n... sworn in friday as the university's nineteenth president he's been working in the office since January\nButter is a former General Electric executive in Green Beret who graduated first in his class\nFrom the U.S military academy at West point Montana officials say lieutenant governor Mike Cooney is in Mexico this week leading a trade delegation to promote barley exports ... said in a statement that Mexico\nIs the largest importer of multiple early and that's important to the states agricultural industry to reaffirming build that relationship\nU.S Department of agriculture statistics show Montana is among the top three barley producing states\nGovernor Bullock's office said the U.S sold Mexico two hundred and forty two million dollars worth of multi grown from barley last year Montana talks and I'm Jeff how\nNow building very weather news talk Ninety five point five\nTemperatures cooler the next several days we're looking at decreasing clouds today a chance of rain showers in the morning daytime Heinz will be in the mid fifties partly cloudy tonight will drop down into the mid thirties and then mostly sunny skies for Tuesday with age I'm ...

by Montana as being part of the show anytime by calling hero six to nine four zero nine seven news Tom Ninety five point five where Montana calls\n[laughter] well even even before this horrific attacks on the Jewish synagogue and Pittsburgh over the weekend I was I was actually looking to get our friend a rabbi ... back on the show here\nAnyway because he recently wrote a great guest opinion column in the Bozeman daily chronicled talking about civility and I thought we need to get him back on the show talking about this because I I don't know what it is with people that\nThat uh people are just that they're losing their minds they they just\nIt's like they can't even talk to each other anymore over simple disagreements it's it's just a crazy but a rabbi definitely I'd I'd I'd love to hear your message affirm that affirm that column if we have time but first\nYour thoughts and is that does you know what what was your reaction like here in Montana I mean is there a certain numbness to the fact that that the Jewish people have been under so much attack are so many attacks for so long and and almost that this anti Semitism it it's really beyond just anti\nIsrael as animals that are tolerated it yeah\nThat's the short term that you know the way I Want to you know whether it's ... ... bbs movement against the trying to boycott Israel or or whether it's black lives matter becoming a pro Palestinian movement against Israel\nIt's a very very slippery slope um between anti Israel and anti Jewish and many times the anti anti Israel really just saw\nFor anti Semitism but to your question about the numbness um I think unfortunately over the last fifty years we've become numb to a certain extent\nOver terrorist attacks and the holy land of Israel we still respond the way the Jewish people always responded with brothers ship Brotherhood and sisterhood that's on our local and the other in the world when the African Montana here that a Catholic who murdered in ...\nUm it's okay it's like another news story but when we sit and you know in a coffee shop in Livingston and we hear that a Jew was murdered any tomorrow in Jerusalem or in a full on Israel it hits home\nBut we become somewhat desensitized because it happens way too often I think what shocked us this Saturday morning this job is was that it was right here in our in our beautiful United States\nThat that that in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania you know talk about you know the heart and soul the working class of the United states of America and right in that community most of the people in the synagogue were over the age of fifty most of the people murdered were over the age of sixty\nBut to go down and such a way because someone photo was important that old Jews must die and we're all on some level to blame for it and that was part of all my articles about\nHow he's in Bozeman a daily chronicle ... news you can read in in maybe for a little reverse the prospect of our listeners one of the things I loved about a year or so that I spent living in Bozeman was to get to go to some of your events in and it was great there were Democrats Republicans Christians you didn't matter right and everybody was hanging out and having a great time\nAnd it's almost like what is it in today's day and age that if you disagree with somebody especially politically they they won't even talk to you they won't even ... even\nI view and and I I take pride in the fact that in our community when we gather for Shabaab dinner for prayer service I've had people from you know and I wrote about this and the article and had one of the leaders of both of Montana the party sitting alongside one of ... ... you know former governor Schweitzer is a council sitting right next to them they didn't even know who the other one was\nUm and they sat and\nPhrase the gathering guess a lot of work that's fine because instead of being obsessed with politics all the time this week\nI Know and I said this yesterday there was a gathering here in Bozeman in memorial memorial service for Pittsburgh\nAre going to be people trying to politicize the terrible tragedy in Pittsburgh\nOne group is going to be screaming gun control the other one's going to be screaming mental health they're going to be screaming the Republicans Democrats free speech on election this is not what it's about this is about your own adultery rated hatred for the Jewish people\nAnd that is something that the world there is no other minority in the world\nThat has ever been have is like the Jewish people I don't know why we earned that perhaps it's envy perhaps it curiosity perhaps it simply illogical going back all the way I'm I'm I'm only in the Bible I'm a lake who attacked the Jewish people and they left Egypt for no good reason\nAnd so I Can't explain anti Semitism\nBut I Know that it's not new it's four thousand years old from the days of Abraham and Sarah but when we as a society can tolerate even the slightest minute as form of it because when we do you know first they always come to the Jews the famous a famous writings of the Catholic priest and\nIn Germany first came to the Jews and we weren't Jews so we didn't end up with a Jew then they came from the gypsies we weren't gypsies and they keep the homosexual than we were\nAnd then they came for us and that was going to stand up for us and so\nYou know we as a society this is not just about eleven years in Pittsburgh this is about I mean a society where we say that in the name of it's okay to go and um you know safe\nThings online like old Jews must dog when I wrote a health says things like\nThat and and not only in in that should clearly be you know should not be tolerated but I I think you're exactly right to that there is the slippery slope where where they will they will put on the veil of oh no I'm just criticizing Israel and I think you're right there is a very slippery slope there I I\nYou know and and I think ...

that the most people have decided which way they're going to vote for the most part there are going to be plenty of\nUndecided it's and I think that that may have a little bit of us way there are in the direction or depending on how how things go a\nPresident Trump has promised that they would secure that southern border and so the motivation factor for Republicans will increase simply because uh if he goes through with us exec in order it will motivate them a little bit more\nUh showing that she is trying to fulfill his campaign promise of securing that southern border\nOr the other thing that President Trump or really needs to point to is\nFact that we already have laws and plays regarding the immigration into this country and the bad it is is a duty under the constitution to see that all the laws are and\nThe Republicans are really kind of hoping that terms it's really kind of the chance that I mean\nWe've now seen President Trump here in Montana three times already this election season he's coming back for a fourth apparently could be next weekend in Bozeman, Montana\nBut you don't just sit here and his Montana rallies you see it all across the country Bill Maher outlaw is they repeated refrain\nEverywhere this president go and men partly why you think you see in a hundred thousand plus people sign up for some of his rallies in places like Texas a ... you think this is kind of the defining issue heading into the mid term elections or is it something else right now\nSo I'm\nSure that the that has a large issue I think one of the other uh siting issue is going to be a an employment factor\nOr not only do we see a unemployment at an all time low a across the nation but a particular we see that the African American as well as Hispanic unemployment rate is at the lowest that it's ever been\nA and forty fifty years so I think that will also play a huge effect\nOn this election because people tend to vote their pocketbooks [noise] or if they're doing well financially they will tend to vote for the party of the president's who's in office at the time ah so between that and she has this big issue I think it may\nBe persuasive enough to\nIf not to keep all blue wave off to cut it down to trickle\nWell it's funny that you mentioned the unemployment rates now you know among Hispanics and black Americans as well and in fact I saw story Fox News dot com Kanye West is throwing a literal ... into the political arena once again\nAnd now he's designing a line of T shirts and hats for a campaign dedicated to urging black voters in the United states to break away\nSenator Lindsey Graham who really was the hero of the justice ... I mean you could just tell [noise]\nUh how\nYou could just [noise] you could just tell that it just struck into his cooler how despicable Senate Democrats treated\nA justice Brett Kavanaugh and his family during the entire process all for politics and yet they have the nerve to lecture the rest of the country about civility right [noise] but anyway Lindsey Graham is going\nTo be in Montana on Wednesday Lindsey Graham will be in ...\nI I thought it was interesting there was a a a Democrat legislators the legislator is he a candidate I got I got to look up his name here again um but but I think he's he had a great falls let me pull it up for yeah I've got it here we'll get to it will get dual gimme gimme some time here oh yeah Jim Hamilton\nHouse districts sixty one Democrat\nSo uh can't loops and with Kay pax TV or sent out a tweet about how Lindsey Graham who's going to be in Bozeman on Wednesday to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale and and Jim Hamilton and Democrats as is I Wonder how is old pal John McCain\nWould feel about him campaigning for a guy who's opponent senator tester has done so much for veterans when he has done so little that like a Jim\nJim you you know so little about that which you tweet\nUp yet first off a Senator Jon tester on veterans I think we all know how that one has played out Senator Jon tester has done jak for veterans oh yeah you'll have a handful of veterans that he'll use in his campaign commercials here's the bigger picture here I 'cause I I think I Need to put this out here first and then we'll talk about about John McCain\nA because John McCain or would not be supporting Jon Tester in fact John McCain already gives why I had to tell this to the old plural Jim Hamilton as ... as I said look Jim\nJohn McCain himself has campaigned against John tester and the front page of yesterday's billings Gazette showed testers failure on veterans issues [noise] did you I I asked Rand Paul about this because literally I went I I went to the gym yesterday morning\nA gun in a good workout and then when the wet and ah you know have you ever get those gift cards and then you have one in your pocket and you don't know if there's anything left on it you're like I'm just going to go uses gift card check done with the ...\nI only had thirty five steps on the thing but I don't care I just wanted to use it said thirty five cents right so so I go get my cup of coffee and of course then you can get your free copy of of the paper and you can so I like that 'cause then you\nThen you get at least see what message they're putting out what how they're you know the message is they're sending with how they craft the front page of their paper and I couldn't I couldn't believe it I couldn't believe that they allowed those headlines to be on the front page of the paper a persistent staffing shortages at the Montana VA\nThat that was the headline and then underneath that it also talked about how the the weight problems persist folks this is what happens after twelve years of having somebody like John ...\nAffairs in the United States Senate the VA went backwards thanks to John tester but but you see now that I'm hearing his campaign commercials\nIt all makes sense think about it there's just think about it it's obvious look the more veterans that have problem getting health care from the government from the VA the harder it is for them to get routine basic medical stuff done\nThe easier it is for politicians like him to come in and help out with congressional case work and say look what I did for you think about it is not in Jon Tester's interest to fix the VA\nBecause if he fixes the problems he doesn't have to have people coming and begging his office in kissing his ring\nTo get the basic stuff that they should already be getting right\nThey should not have to go to some member I don't have a Republican or Democrat they should not have to go begging you for dang help because you screwed up the process and the first place and now you think we're all just supposed to say Oh thank you John Oh thank you well first off there isn't a number of veterans that he's ignore that he has not helped that he has refused to help\nYou know uh that's that's a side bar here though but the fact is is that Jon Tester resisted the very reforms that are going to start cleaning up this mess at the VA he spent almost all twelve years of his time in office\nResisting and opposing the very reforms that he's now trying to take credit for\nBecause it's an election year and he's got nothing else to run on\n... so that's what his whole veterans ads are all about it's is it John tester taking credit for this stuff that he didn't write\nThe reforms that he opposed and then barely signed on on the last minute now he's trying to take credit for it but but but if you listen closely to I'm telling you listen to his campaign commercials\nAnd and what he's what he's basically saying is Jon Tester is profiting from the failed system just like the Congressional Black caucus the profits from failed economies in our inner cities why do you think they sat on their hands and refused\nTo cheer refused to applaud refused to stand up when President Trump in his state of the union address early earlier this year talked about record low unemployment among a\nBlack Americans because that doesn't benefit the Democrats and the Congressional Black caucus they stay in power when other people are not empowered\nThey stay in office and they stay in power based off of the plight of others so they have to continue that plight the economy has to continue to suffer so that they can prosper in Washington DC right same thing\nWith tester it has never been in his interest to fix the V. eight to reform the VA to\nBetter veterans care because then they don't have to go to him and asked for his help and then he can't cut a campaign commercial for years later saying oh look I this person finally got their check from the government or you know\nIt's so so that's why the guy is just such a fraud is such a phony um and and yes the way he treated navy admiral in Iraq War veteran Ronny Jackson\nA was garbage or there there's some headlines effect the Associated Press even pick this up over the weekend a Donald Trump junior\nA where where's the story yet here I got to do is in the hill Donald Trump junior a basically said that Jon Tester is garbage or you know it might sound a little on civil the some of you out there but think about the way\nJohn tester treated Ronny Jackson think about the way that he jumped on CNN calling him the candy man er here you go to this is what Donald Trump junior or said here he said uh called test or a piece of garbage for sinking\nThe candy man a here you go to this is what Donald Trump junior or said here he said a contest or a piece of garbage for sinking navy rear admiral Ronny Jackson's nomination to lead the department of Veterans Affairs earlier this year\nTo go after and try to assassinate with no proof no basis no nothing a good man simply because my father wanted to elevate him and put him in charge of an organization\nWhen Jon Tester who's his lap dog does that what happened\nSo where's the accountability to Jon Tester who did that here uh he added is a Donald Trump junior this was that that was being quoted in a piece by the hill or he's also quoted a\nOut of a a speech in Missoula, Montana by political where Donald Trump junior said that even the secret service agents that protect him can't stand it tester for his role in derailing Jackson's nomination 'cause remember the secret service agents know so Ronny Jackson too I mean there were there with them for all eight years of the Obama\nWhite House when Ronny Jackson was a rock Obama's Dr\nDonald Trump junior said this and he nailed who said Jon Tester talks a big game on vets\nThe only thing I've seen him do for vets is attack Ronny Jackson and the ... office with unfounded allegations\nThat should bother you guys for more than anything that's what Donald Trump junior had to say All right ah but yeah so so Lindsey Graham is coming to Montana he's going to be in Bozeman on Wednesday campaigning on behalf of Matt Rosendale and so this Democrat at a house district fifty one Jim Hamilton\nHe says he says\nHe says well I'm a ... vote when John McCain do what what John McCain say if if he knew that his buddy Lindsey Graham was out here campaigning against John tester\nYou know what John John McCain would probably be out here alongside with them or you know and I'm not going out on a limb here why because John McCain already came to Montana and campaigned against John tester so I'm Sorry a representative or Hamilton\nI'm a hate to break the news for you but ah but ah yeah Lindsey Graham will be here and I you know I was going to this yesterday to maybe it's just as I had a good cup of coffee as I was on the way over to American family restaurant and see Rand Paul\nBut I just thought about this I mean here we got President Trump getting ready to come back to Montana for eight an unprecedented for a trip to the big guys state to the treasure state why do you think they call us at treasure state\nHere is coming back from it and who would have thought this because because conservatives are now very optimistic that they can pull off the Senate the election victory here in a little over a week but who would've thought that way back last spring\nThat\nJon Tester would have been on the run who would have thought that and that freedom would be on the march I mean Rand Paul coming to Montana a Donald Trump coming back to Montana for a fourth visit freedom is on the march here in Montana are we going to take a quick\nBreak here for six to nine four zero nine Seventy if you want to jump in on the conversation you can also a drop me via Twitter by the way all the

I saw a friend in the Trump rally in Missoula five minute\nCow metallic came along a few years ago I'm Alive are all these people who have truly stood up and continue to talk on the radio the crowd is show proven way America is great because of the people want to be great but you got\nIt got to get out and do the right thing and you got to recognize where the wrong has been so you can rectify it and make a great again\nThey were never give up never quit yeah good words are good words for assault for six to nine four zero nine Seventy is the phone number a next step we got Tim in billings listen at a nine Seventy KB U L Tim good to hear from you\nGoing in there or or just wanted to mention you know there was a horrible thing that went on over the weekend\nYou know there's a fellow sending the\nThe supposed bombs through the mail and then the fellow that shot up the synagogue and in the ... but there was also a very good things that went on over the weekend that uh you know aren't getting the press coverage and I think they deserve and you know there was that uh that black leadership summit there in Washington DC there is\nThree to four hundred because young conservative black leaders were that met in the White House and then there was the uh the walk away movement going on in the DC area as well they had a ball on friday night and then they had their march on Saturday and I watch them from Youtube videos of that now\nLet's go you have people of all races all religions coming together saying you know what\nThis this Democratic Party is not the party that we used to believe in and where were you know we're walking away from it and I think that you know it's it's a very dangerous thing because if the media were to let any of that out boy I think I think you see a mass exodus from the Democratic party because it\nIs not the party that it used to be this is not the parties at a you know John F. Kennedy and and Harry Truman you know these are these people are are there's psycho man there they are you know died in the war communist\nSocialist psychopaths that want to rule your lives\nAnd not all it's not all of them I mean to be fair not not all of the party members but but you're right the the the the base element that is the Democrat socialist movement that has really dug in that party in the corner\nI mean that's the ... they're they're blatantly calling themselves Democrat socialist now too I did you hear about the Brazilian elections at all Tim ...\nAnd and the Brazilian Donald Trump and fellow survived a stabbing attack both a NATO or something like that one one in a landslide you know this this man is\nHe's a pro family\nPro liberty ... bill first gets attacked by a leftist that tries to kill him because he doesn't believe in this political views\nWhich is disgusting and I you know we need to be careful about the anti Semitism thing you can criticize someone because of their belief when it comes to their political agenda not because of their religion and you have to be able to separate the two because\nI saw that Lou Dobbs got a segment that got pulled off the air because someone from judicial watch said that it was criticizing George Soros they could do that then I submitted\nWhich is absurd deal like it doesn't matter what George Soros religion is if George ... is is corrupt in his wrong you know that's not anti Semitic to call George Soros that I mean the yeah that was that was outrageous\nOf about about that now so I get okay Mm yeah maybe now because of the you know that that crazy a guy\nUm who wasn't just some old white guy by the way the guy down in Florida who was doing those those bombings\nOkay yeah maybe out of sensitivity you wouldn't focus on that but then again like that's what the left wants their idea of civility is you shutting up you're not saying anything and and but they can say whatever they want they can they can you know dominate the liberal media all day long but the moment you speak up\nThey called for civility these are the same people that won't even sit down with you that won't even have a reasonable conversation with you but they'll call for civility which really means just have shut up stopped ... talking to me I'm Tim and it's interesting you mentioned the two things well first off on the uh the Brazilian election and this was the quote from the uh\nThe new president down there in Brazil both an auto ah ... says quote we cannot continue to flirt with socialism with communism and with populism and with the extreme left that was his quotes in today's political playbook and then they're in D.C he was referencing the black leadership someone over the weekend\nOr in fact I I ran into a family here in Montana their son was at that young young I'm a black American from here in Montana good man he was there at that event and they're calling it a Kansas Owens who's this young black conservative ... blacks it a black exit from the Democratic party\nA kind of like ... the British exit from the use of their ... and a and apparently Kanye West is now he's design and T shirts and everything\nBasically encouraging black Americans to leave the Democratic party all this as a President Trump's approval ratings have been soaring All right let's go to the next that we've got Vinnie in Livingston listen to indicate the arcade Vinnie good to hear from you your thoughts\nApproval ratings have been soaring All right let's go to the next step would get Vinnie in Livingston listening

primary\nAnd Rosendale getting a test or ... or so ago and I'm Glad it wasn't true down\nGoes that's where we decide things in this country\nYou know we we do our primaries are I during their view place holder and gets hurt offers\nProud to be the next\nMorning to huh\nThat's the way I look at it maybe I Am very ... protest or\nWhat do you what do you think about Dr aloe chefs you'd think he's he he might have to have these\nGreat I think he was too sure\nWell I think we might see him again and twenty twenty he picked up a lot of traction out there are a lot a lot of folks light do more than likely to\nBetter better candidate because he didn't have a record behind\nBehind and I also watch\nIt would have made something up you know you got all that good for the first\nTime since Ninety
