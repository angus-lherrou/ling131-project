there but uh\nBut here's the deal so people were I and I heard him from some good conservative friends were like what in the world like I get it the weddings but this this is one of the most important votes of of President Trump's tenure don't worry folks saw going to be All right uh so they they basically can hold the vote open longer\nA over through the weekend so that he can walk down the I'll be there and then he'll kind of be like a a a oh who was the guy and father of the bride he'll be running in with his tuxedo on a vote on the floor of the Senate I think as long as you're wearing like something like a suit you can get away with it\nUm it Denny Rehberg used to get in trouble because he'd where his his black jeans and cowboy boots and and and he got away with it for a long time because they just thought they were slacks and they finally got onto his game that he was wearing black there's wearing black jeans [laughter] instead of slacks [laughter]\nTypical Montana guy there like it uh but that's going to be fine but here's the deal so Senator Jon tester is the story this not getting a lot of air time right now is the fact that Senator Jon tester\nIs cancelling the debate they're supposed to be a debate Saturday Night between him and Montana state auditor and Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale and so tester now his cancelled the debate says he won't be there he won't make it\nWhich I just think it's interesting I mean Here's Senator Steve Gaines he's going to make sure that he attended an important function like his daughter's wedding and he'll still be able to get the vote in if necessary as well and supportive judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBut yet you know here's Jon Tester up no got cancelled their mate gotta cancel the debates because he doesn't want to be held accountable by Matt Rosendale [laughter] and and another debate apparently here but there's one of ... well there's there's one of two things going on with tester here\nThat somehow they would they would want to speak up about that wow just amazing that they're they're spending more money to have to combat these attacks on their industry\nDoes does go figure [laughter] is this such a shocker to people [noise]\nUm anyway I I think what they do all these these stories like this is because they're they're trying to basically help fundraiser for the other side uh they're they're they're basically trying to say\nOh you give your money to the people that want to raise your taxes\nYou know if you got that much money in your pockets that that you need to raise taxes on the rest

we\nDo have some breaking news out here uh right now that just came in here I'm seeing a the breaking news update coming in from political also this from the wall Street Journal\nMore positive economic news here under the Trump Administration the U.S unemployment rate fell to three point seven percent in September the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nLowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine I'm sure Obama is out there is that you didn't build that\nWhile the economy added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs so that so that's the only at least a downside to this latest report is that the the the ... jobs additions are below the forecasts here right now\nUm but the unemployment rate is at the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine ah that's according to the wall Street Journal also other political noting that average hourly private sector earnings were up\nTo point eight percent over the previous year\nI'm In the unemployment rate yet told you about that one so there you go\nUh I guess analyst a survey by Bloomberg had expected a hundred and eighty thousand more job so only came in at a hundred and thirty thousand but uh yeah either way the lowest unemployment rate\nSince Nineteen sixty not there you go our senator Steve Gaines on Fox News yesterday 'cause the big question you know people people who are here and that that senator Steve Gaines\nIs it was going to be at his daughter's wedding on Saturday and obviously nothing's going to deter him from a a walk and his daughter down the aisle\nAnd so a lot of people were freaking out well wait a minute what if what if that could be the one vote that that thinks that the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh a first off it sounds like everything's fine anyway because it now this latest to yet another FBI background check came back\n... and they interviewed more folks like look there's no corroborating evidence so there's nothing there are so at this point it's like they're just gonna move on with the vote so that it sounds like that\nHas gained the support of maybe a Democrat Joe Manchin or at least the the moderate Republican senators who who've been squishy on Kavanaugh so far\nUh but either way uh I I think senator days is making a pretty clear that hate hate he can he can do both he can go to his daughter's wedding in Montana this weekend and he can also\nBe be there to vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh when when require that can hold the vote open et cetera but anyway here's a senator Steve Gaines in his own words on Fox News yesterday\nI went to a stranger when I got involved in God's counting on one of the ... senators Clinton and\nPart of the whole historic conclusion to this on Saturday because his daughter in getting married right joining us ally Montana republic game well okay it's going to have you with that everybody's sort of had a little freaked out today when they realize your daughter is getting married on Saturday that anything they want to know what the plan ...\nA month ago wouldn't expect this to be in conflict with this vote but the one I just spoke with judge gambling on a game called tonight because the news was out there and then about the wedding Jedi Kevin I'm only very very clear my support for you has been unwavering in fact after spending three hours\nIf a judge Kevin ... very very clear my support for you has been unwavering in fact after spending three hours\nWith some mental FBI report today my support not that it was ever winning but I'll tell you what when you look at the evidence was presented today there's absolutely zero zero corroborating evidence to support these allegations I suggest cabin on\nA I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed any time machine\nWhere planes name so here's how it's going to work the the the next most important votes tomorrow night or even\nIf we've got to get past that find a and then that will set the clock here for the voting on Saturday I've got a wedding on Saturday my goal this weekend has to walk my daughter down the aisle\nAnd to see a union new United States Supreme Court justice and put on a on our you know kind of plant we didn't\nPlan well no it's it's it there's nothing secret about it and uh most are held open all the time before the U.S Senate wants to vote is called they're missing extenuating circumstances you can go back in time in history and so you would have had to hold the vote open for member to come back in and out of their voting absolutely\nSo I'll be there some of the the magic number here is fifty ... me to get to that tomorrow and then we need to get the fifty on Saturday\nOkay otherwise we're going to Washington you running in ... when I talk to you know well you know it'll\nIt'll be in a ... of the bride their accounts and deciding vote a ... as needed but at the table and let's get it we're going to find out a lot tomorrow and three now vote he went into we've got a plan ready to go here and I'm sure the judge the judge Kavanaugh\nI've been behind you from the first time I saw we went and we met together in fact in early July had a chance to spend an hour with him in my office and then going through this process spending three hours a day and a scam just continuing to do my due diligence as a senator\nI've come to conclusion I Am solidly voting for just cannot can't vote can't wait to vote yes\nOkay so I just really quickly and asking because some of your senators across Iowa or not is convinced that senator ... this is never a fuller fair investigation entertainment calling it a complete sham I mean other than that it's just the knowledge that they're not going to\nLook the route of arguments they are I mean the thing is shipped to the point I was just desperation and if your fair minded and if you take a look at what the evidence says with these three oh two investigations have produced you'll say that these allegations are false there's no corroborating evidence isn't very clear cut vote for me\nOkay you're young and we'll see how they play that they have something in in and we wish you all the back of your family of a wedding this weekend we've gotten excited on right now to do something\nYou All right as senator Steve days that I remember one of the first times before Steve Gaines was even a a United States senator or congressman\nA first time I get a chance to meet senator Steve Danes uh was when he was actually the chair chairman for Mike Huckabee when Mike Huckabee was running for president a steep Danes was was kinda spearheading the effort in support of Mike Huckabee former Arkansas governor of course many of you know him well\nAnd and it missed us how could be Mike Huckabee's wife just just loved a steep Danes is one of his daughters that was there with him as just a little kid at the top so it's just crazy to to think how you know ten years later here we are and he's the United states senator\nA talking on Fox News about one of the most important of the votes that will take place in President Trump's first term here uh speaking of terms mid term elections coming up what are we thirty two days away now I think we're thirty two days away from the November elections today's October fifth\nOne of the other things I asked Kellyanne Conway from the White House 'cause she's really kind of known as as the queen of of polling and and and and pollsters and all that so I asked her I said how\nUnited Republicans were going to talk with Dave wry about this or that in the seven o'clock hour as well

I think\nThat's probably what what ... asked me to be able to show up at least briefly I put a Facebook post out which I'm surprised that the voluminous reaction to\n'em I said you know I've never I've always been a never Trump Republican\nUh but um after the last two weeks of Senate hearings and smearing the reputation of a good man and\nNot carrying if they ruined his life and and putting out what I think are baseless charges about his character all for the sake of their political agenda I said I have never been more of an anti democratic than I Am right now\nSo you know I may not be the total Republican I used to be but in terms of wanting Democrats defeated I have never felt more passionately that way either\nReally bothered by\nAll the all the behavior of the reactions of the Senate and and you know they said on day one of the nomination that they were opposed to it because it was going to change the political complex of the Supreme Court for it I should say the ideological collection of the Supreme Court and the okay that's\nUnderstandable irritating but understandable but but\nThis later attempt to smear the guy's reputation for no reason other than their political agenda when they were already going to vote against them anyway and we're just looking for a reason and that really got to me so I'm I'm\nYeah it ... it went from my question of humanity to or from from a question of sanity to a question of humanity with yes absolutely\nAnd and I think any normal human being would have gotten upset at those charges especially if they're baseless which I think they are and and then it gives this charge of not having judicial temperament because he gets upset about that you know as Ninety nine point nine percent of the human race would have\nYeah yeah I mean I in fact I had a caller from Bozeman the other day who says well\nI just don't think he should have responded the way he did he should not have been angry I mean this is supposed to be a man of judicial temperament night so I said okay Daniel I said to the next three days we're going to run nonstop TV and radio news updates and blasted all over the newspapers about how you're a rapist then you won't get that\nOh well uh uh uh uh yeah okay right [laughter] you know what if if\nIf he had reacted in an an emotional way they would have said well the guy is just a robot he's not human they either way they're going to attack him\nYeah and one by the way I did not as well I was going back to look at your regional Facebook post\nMark that you just had another ... oh I Know yeah I'm a I had a\nMilestone birthday yesterday thank you very much\nWhich one was that can you hear that and I'm Seventy five All right we'll congrats may well I'm up there [laughter] seems like\nMy dad

but now they're just losing their minds all over the place and and uh uncivil behavior which I described the Trump is being more than tripled by the other side\nIt's just really it really does it's depressing situation that\nThe country is and this kind of mode of mutual hatred we should we can't work that way sneezing but anyway I think in\nTerms of the cabinet thing or Republicans are suddenly

right at our house to describe what there was going to be supposedly a blue wave a in a midterm election trying to and and the president's party almost always loses seats during a midterm election anyway so with that historical standard\nA plus the plus reaction to Trump either pro or con but extreme on both sides of the you have figured there was going to be a blue wave and the Democrats or

being too strong here he's being too strong here this is an opening for Heidi Heitkamp to respond and do this gives her the cover to\nVote against Kavanaugh than the polling came out he's ten points ahead of her\nAfter the cabinet confirmation hearings now now that she's officially said she's going to vote no apparent she's toast she's done that the national Republican Senatorial Committee a political opponent this out this morning they've already begun canceling at least some of their planned advertising\nIn North Dakota so so whatever they had on the books for like a October seventeenth through and through the November election they're already started to take that off the books because we don't need to spend as much of our money in North Dakota now because the high camp is host\nWow wow very studying developments that we see on the north Dakota\nCourse now we get more money they can spend in Montana or to put on the pressure on Jon Tester ... here with Montana talks of jumped right into the phone lines anything and everything you want to talk about here on Montana talks plus the eight o'clock hour great time to talk about some events coming up here in town so\nYou can call in about that is well we got bin Oscar Miller on the phone lines been good to hear from you what's going on\nPhone lines are open if you want to jump in on the conversation for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy on our river rocks cabinet company phone lines Aaron ... here with Montana talks\nComing up in the nine o'clock hour of working on the phone lines open to anything and everything you want to talk about for most of the hour a lot the phone lines are open also when we have guests on the show if you want to jump in on that conversation too so we've got a Concerned Veterans of for America\nOn the kicking off the show today or they want to call out liberal Democrat Senator Jon Tester for his real record on veterans issues how he has not been helping veterans\nA and a and I think we'll need to call out that Jon Tester for lying in his ads he claims oh Trump's signed my bills my bills is on your bills come on man\nUh but anyway we'll talk with Concerned Veterans for America coming up in the nine o'clock our phone lines are open now though are for it for you if you want to jump in on the conversation at all um we did get a message from a question from spike in shepherd he called in during the break he's just had a quick question he says\nYou know given the recent polling that basically shows the Senate race here in Montana as a toss up between Matt Rosendale and liberal or Jon Tester\nWill test are now change his vote on Kavanaugh I doubt it and I think I think tester is so arrogant right now\nThat he doesn't care how many people call his office he doesn't care what Montanans think about judge Brett Kavanaugh I think he so arrogant Li thinks that that he can do whatever he wants and we'll get away with it that uh that he's he's still going to vote no against Kavanaugh and he's he's maintained that here in the last few days that\nThat he will vote against Kavanaugh in fact uh I don't know if you heard about this but\nThere was supposed to be a debate Saturday Night between Matt Rosendale Jon Tester well Jon Tester is now canceling out of the debate he's now\nThe backing away from the debate because he says that he needs to be back in Washington DC in the event of a vote on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation so there there's really one of two things that could be going on here\nUh one is that you know Jon Tester is just too afraid to debate Matt Rosendale\nOr he's too afraid to be held accountable in that debate so that that could be happening here\nAh or the other thing is Jon Tester is so motivated to vote against President Trump and his nominees that he's willing to duck out of this debate\nIn order to do so so make because really he could have the best of both worlds couldn't he I mean if he if he wasn't afraid to debate Matt Rosendale he could show up for the debate and he could still vote regarding the cabinet confirmation hurts I mean\nI mean if he if he wasn't afraid to debate Matt Rosendale he could show for the debate and he could still vote regarding the cabinet confirmation or I mean that's what senator Steve Gaines\nIs basically saying he's going to do so because on the flip side of that I also got an email from a from a leaner and Philips Burke and and I covered this news earlier this probably back in the six o'clock hour a timeline\nOr maybe slightly mentioned at the seven o'clock hour but definitely wanted to get back into it here so the other big story yesterday was senator Steve Gaines said that that on Saturday when the Kavanaugh vote is supposed to take place\nHe's got to be back here for his daughter's wedding in Montana and he's not missing his daughter's wedding he is going to walk his daughter down the aisle a you know if you'd expect out of a Montana dead right hey he's going to be there to walk is\nNo matter what is going to Washington DC he's going to be there to walk his daughter down the aisle up but now a lot of people were freaking out wait a minute if he can't be there to vote on Kavanaugh could that sink the cabinet confirmations or don't don't worry no worry effect US Senator Steve Danes was on Fox News last night\nTalking about uh that very subject\nAre and what a stranger when it's really not involving judge Kavanaugh what are the same he'll be Senator Clinton is part of this whole historic conclusion to this on Saturday because his daughter in getting married or joining us ally Montana Republican\nGains wow okay it's going to have you with that everybody's sort of had a little freaked out today when they realize your daughter is getting married on Saturday Sunday they think they want to vote what's the plan\nWell a month ago wouldn't expect this to be in conflict with this vote but see what I just spoke with judge gambling on I gave him a call tonight because the news was out there that about the wedding\nIf a judge Kevin ... very very clear my support for you has been unwavering in fact after spending three hours\nWith some mental FBI report today my support not that it was ever winning but I'll tell you what when you look at the evidence was presented today\nThere's absolutely zero zero corroborating evidence to support these allegations I said just having a a I'm going to be their devote for you as needed any time machine\nWhere planes thanks so here's how it's going to work the the the next most important votes tomorrow then either even\nIf we've got to get past that frightened ah and then that will set the clock here for the vote on Saturday and I've got a wedding on Saturday my goal this weekend is to walk my daughter down the aisle\nAnd to see a union new United States Supreme Court justice and put on hold on our you know kind of plant renewable energy plan will know if it's if there's nothing secret about it and\nUh most are held open all the time before the U.S Senate wants voters cold there been some extenuating circumstance you can go back in time in history and see what have had to hold the vote open ... from member to come back in and out of their vote absolutely\nSo I'll be there so the the magic number here is fifty me to get to that tomorrow and then we need to get to fifty on Saturday\nOkay otherwise we're going to Washington you running in ... when I talk to you know well I ... you know\nIt'll it'll be in a ... for the bride their accounts and deciding vote in a ... as needed but at the table let's get we're going to find out a lot tomorrow answering that vote even though we've got a plan ready to go here and I'm sure the judge the judge Kavanaugh\nI've been behind you from the first time I saw we went and we met together in fact in early July had a chance to spend an hour with them in my office and then going through this process spending three hours a day and this gift just continuing to do my due diligence as a senator\nI've come to lose I Am solidly voting for just having a can't vote can't wait to vote yes\nSo I just really quickly when it happened because some of your senators across Iowa or not is convinced that Senate race\nYou can entertain and calling into complete sham I mean other than that it's not like they're not going to come and\nLook they're out of arguments they are I mean the thing is simply point out his desperation and if you are fair minded and if you take a look at what the evidence is with these three one two investigations have produced you'll say that these allegations are false there's no corroborating evidence isn't very clear cut and vote for me\nOkay you're young and we'll see how they play that thing for something and in and we wish you all about your family of a wedding this weekend gotten excited on right now to do it for something you\nAre there you go that was senator Steve Gaines on Fox

senators the Danes on Fox News\nTalking about all the wedding and the ... vote a he says both are going to happen so I'll play that audio for here just sick but But Dan thanks for sticking around um what would your message be\nTo veterans out there I well first off I think I think most of the veterans get it here in Montana I think I think that the admiral Ronny Jackson treatment or by tester was the final nail in the coffin but but for the folks who support veterans and and\nThat are that are wondering like hey how should they voted in the U.S Senate race here in Montana what would you tell them\nWell we would encourage him to vote against senator tester somebody who's who's worked on these issues for for close to ten years now ever since I watched the marine corps and he spent a lot of time here in Washington fighting or foreign fix if\nI can say confidently that that senator tester is an obstacle to reforming in fixing the VA despite what he's saying in his campaign commercials they're incredibly misleading\nHe is is like somebody who who is who goes into a fourth quarter of Super Bowl when the winning team up fifty points and then he claimed credit for the victory um it it's it's incredibly disappointing to see and the reality is he is not in the champion and he's claiming to be in his campaign commercials\nI had to laugh there because I was just thinking of like okay you're watching a basketball game on TV [noise] your teams up fifty bought a a somebody put that get on the end of the ... you would have been for like thirty seconds and\nThen that that's a great analogy to talk about a VA reform especially yeah Well Dan Caldwell really appreciate you joining us here on the show thanks for being with us this morning\nThinking about me on air and All right good to chat with you and yet a jumping anytime a it down the road to if you got a hot button issues 'cause we've got so many veterans here across Montana you know we're always number one number two across the country in terms of veterans per\nCapita is as you know so um so if you've got more news about veterans legislation\nFeel free to reach out to us anytime phone lines are open for you for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy so the audio senator Steve Gaines on Fox News yesterday how's he going to pull it off\nHow's he going to be able to have the best of both worlds be able to walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding this weekend in Montana and then also ensure that President Trump's Supreme Court nominee\nIt gets confirmed in Saturday's vote here senator ...\nA month ago wouldn't expect this to be income right this vote\nBut the one I just spoke with judge gambling on a game called tonight because the news was out there that about the wedding singer Kevin I'm only very very clear my support for you has been unwavering in fact after spending three hours\nWith some mental and beyond report today my support nothing was ever winning but I'll tell you what when you look at the evidence was presented today\nThere's absolutely zero zero corroborating evidence to support these allegations I suggest Cavanaugh I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed\nAny time they\nWeren't my thing [laughter] years I was going to war the the the next most important votes tomorrow night or even\nIf we've got to get past that friend uh and then that will set the clock here for the vote on Saturday [noise] I've got a wedding on Saturday my goal this weekend has to walk my daughter down the aisle\nAnd to see a union new United States Supreme Court justice and put on hold on our own kind of plant renewable energy plan will know it gets in there there's nothing secret about it a most are held open all the time before the U.S Senate wants to vote as cold they're missing extenuating circumstances you can go back in time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well but it in the north the north Dakota Senate races is another one of those closely watched race is just like the U.S Senate race here in Montana and the word out of political playbook this morning is that the the national Republican Senatorial Committee is now that Heidi Heitkamp\nSaid she is voting no on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation she but she basically has said she is not running for well she was already down ten points anyway according to the latest polling after these Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing of that that fiasco to begin with so she she her poll numbers tanked after that\nAnd she was one of these uh you know moderate Senate Democrats she's she's definitely more moderate than than a Jon Tester is but she was one of the ones that was supposed to survive or in the November elections potentially and then her poll numbers sank as a result of these cabinet confirmation hearing shenanigans and now\nAre the Republicans are basically they're already pulling back whatever whatever advertising they had scheduled there already starting to pull back on that because basically they're the word out of out of out of Washington for those watching the polls is Heidi Heitkamp is done\nHer her no vote on Kavanaugh\nTo day and she'll do it again tomorrow I mean she she is done so kiss that race could buy for the Democrats in North Dakota [noise]\nAll right let's of jumping on the phone lines again here for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy phone lines were always open for you we've got married in Kalispell listening to K. J. J. R. Mary what's your thoughts great to hear from you\nI'm good morning to you and you might never hear this out at me again I decide if this guy was falling right before I called [laughter] around\nHere are liberals that I'm going to praise today this might be a first outlast their lawyers and Alan Dershowitz and Jonathan Turley both of them are liberal and both of them sticking up for this judge's sticking up for Donald Trump they believe in\nFact and they say there is absolutely no evidence for any of this stuff\nAnd so I really appreciate the heck out of them and they're both liberals and then there is a liberal lady and we'll end Kaiser who was one of Dr Christine what's your face\nYou know get the lady that was trying to\nYeah Christine Blasey Ford yeah yeah we\nWere her name is Lee like Kaiser and she's one of her best friends and she was\nSurrounded in her house and that track and they tried to force for a change for story because she said she then this lady's best friend for a long time she can't remember if ever see in judge Kavanaugh anywhere near her and she wouldn't change your story\nAnd one lady who is an FBI agent or something like that too I'm trying to think I'm In is that the friend who was at the end other friend who was the FBI agent\nYou know if we'll and Kaiser is I Hope you don't laugh out loud when you hear if she was so liberal she's married to up their\nOwn wow [laughter] and she was a golf pro huh\nShe she set up the golf um she was the Gulf also the golf coach at Georgetown University I think\nOh interesting okay yeah I'm I in fact I saw ... he he does like radio commentary in the middle ... that a lot of folks here across the country but he also had a big piece of the post on his website and they didn't they just even more holes now that have been that have popped up in ...\nAnd Dr Ford and and and that a woman that you mentioned um is is one of the names and he covered in a story I did not print that for a blog post so I should have from top stars but [laughter]\nShe talking about the um things like she really likes to fly\nI don't know if he mentioned that but but yeah that came up in the confirmation areas because when that prosecutor from Arizona was asking the questions ... 'cause I thought it was kind of odd I was like why don't you just ... the prosecutor said well I'm Dr ... how did you get here uh to Washington\nAnd she's like I flew on an airplane and she's like OK because yeah because they said well she can't come to Washington to testify because she's afraid of flying on airplanes and I ...\nI got a little tiny PF before I leave my reputation good then from

investigate they just go do it [noise]\nI I think my favorite though is when I was a ... a couple of weeks ago when I asked a well your your body men in great falls I said I said well you know what

talk about uh that's why we open up the phone lines it's anything and everything you want to talk about here on the show are let's go to mark in Columbia falls more oh what ... we lost mark okay well that leaves a phone line hoping for you\nFor six to nine four zero nine Seventy is the number two nine four zero nine Seventy a yeah I Am interested in your take I mean okay so Danes is going to vote for Kavanaugh tester is voting against Kavanaugh\nSo test her was supposed to be at a debate on Saturday Night\nUh now he says he's not going to be at the debate on Saturday Night because he has to be there to vote against President Trump's nominee\nSo he won't be there um but uh but Danes has to be at his daughter's wedding so so he's going to be at the wedding but he says yeah don't worry I'll still be able if I have to go back to D.C to vote I'll be able to to walk his he'll be able to walk down the aisle\nAnd he'll be able to go back in and vote back in D.C if needed as well so\nUm so why can't test or do both if Danes can do both you know come to Montana for what he's supposed to be here for why can't test or come back to Montana for what he's supposed to be here for\nAnd then go back in and vote I mean they can hold this process open either way um the initial reaction I'm seeing here I've not seen a reaction from Senator tester yet regarding this morning's vote\nUh but uh Matt Rosendale the Republican Senate candidate or did a respond almost within a minute or two after\nSenator Jon Tester's vote against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd almost within a minute or two after Senator Jon tester is vote against Brett Kavanaugh this morning Matt Rosendale sent this statement out saying quote Jon Tester's opposition to Brett Kavanaugh proves that he's become another Washington democratic liberal resistance above the people of Montana\nWe've had enough of the smear and destroy tactics from Senate Democrats it's time to put an end to this and confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court so I'll keep a monitoring social media and other news outlets here\nWhen we get the brakes just to see a more reaction to this story here but yes Senator Jon tester voted against judge Brett Kavanaugh this morning here\nUh our phone lines are open for you are going to jump back into the phone lines for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy I've also got some more audio a lot a lot of audio clips that we can play for a a here this morning but there there was this one is we're talking about veterans' issues earlier with Dan Caldwell from Concerned Veterans for America\nAnd we were talking about how at the height of the VA scandals veteran's dying on wait lists some of the works worst weightlifting the country or here in Montana and we used to have some of the best records in the country but\nThanks to Obama or and and thanks to a senator tester we ended up having some of the worst wait times in the country and yet at the height of the VA scandal in twenty fourteen this was Jon Tester on MSNBC\nOverall I Will tell you that the VA and I know it's in vogue right now to politicize everything is going on with the with the bottom line is we need to get from the bottom of this we and we need to find out if there was wrongdoing and if there was wrongdoing we need the older people respond\nTo him I mean it's not and vote with all due respect senator there's been a a a waiting list but it's been extraordinarily long and you've got them for the VA that are actually cooking the books and possibly killing veterans we need to get\nTo the bottom of that but I Will tell you the waiting list or we knew was coming and it was coming in and I can tell you that\nThe secretary has reduced it by forty five percent that being said has been increased by forty five percent to 'cause we're we're having veterans come home from Iraq and Afghanistan as we wind these wars now and I think it's good for wine in these wars down we've got to be realistic the fact is is that a\nWaiting list is too long a secretary Shinseki\nHas made it a priority and his work hard at it they had success in the meantime what is Congress done well we've had sequenced ration and we've had shut downs and we've given them anything certainty that the media and so when we see politicians out there that announcing to be there for one thing or the VA and free back at the highest summits", "year": "2018",
