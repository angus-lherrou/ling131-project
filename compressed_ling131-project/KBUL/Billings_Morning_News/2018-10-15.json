supposed to do here in cars this language can be sometimes\nA confusing I joined us on the phone lines here as part of stop I one eighty six basically I one eighty sixes viewed as an initiative that would ban any new mining way effectively when you look at it but there's also concerns as to what it might do to existing\nMines that are in operation here in Montana as we speak I mentioned again thanks for joining us here on the show great to have you from view this morning [noise]\nYeah it's good to be here and yeah we were we were talking going yeah go\nAhead oh yeah I was gonna say yeah you know go go ahead 'cause I knew you were talking about the impact Butte specifically in yeah I've I've been to gold and some of my mind that right outside of white hall myself and you got people traveling from all over to work for good high wage jobs like that but I'm not on top of that I mean you've got\nYou know environmental engineering firms who who travel from maybe Bozeman or maybe even billings et cetera uh two two that have support industries that the tie in with the mining what's the Montana impact\nThe Montana ... it it it's a major I mean the economic study that was just completed by the business and economic research bureau over at the University of Montana determined that the mining industry in Montana\nSupports over twelve thousand three hundred jobs in Montana for a total economic impact of a to point seven two billion dollars\nAnd and I would I Would ship that focus across to what you share as one of the reasons for why one eighty six from the proponents they claim that mining as it's done in Montana is threatening\nThe outdoor economic industry which right now is that outdoor recreation economy is\nIs a claim to to bring in over seven billion dollars right now you point seven five billion dollar mining economy along side\nA seven billion dollar your outdoor recreation industry and there's no one eighty six out here it's a pretty nice balance right now the Montana and sad but I I Would also point to that seven point one billion dollars top of that is coming from Montanans in states\nExactly reading and and living the way Montanans do and so you shut down the future of lighting in Montana and not only are you going to see my name's economy take it you're going to see that outdoor recreation economy ... hit as well as families\nDon't have that disposable income to go fishing hunting hiking visiting our national and state parks here it's\nAgain just just not not a well thought out initiated unless you can get that\nThat the skin and peel it for what it's worth it's trying to end the mining industry and non candidates being funded press being primarily funded and operated by\nDarn it I think we'll get to a to this one in the nine o'clock hour does this is actually really interesting um so as we talk about drizzly bear habitat and we know the grizzly population is just out of control right now that's where even were grizzly supporters like\nLike Jack Hanna say hey it's time to remove them from the endangered species list I mean come on the edge remove them off the list already but yet that liberal judge in Missoula\nI'm stopped the grizzly bear hunt down in Wyoming hum and and there's there's a misnomer ... that the easy thought as to say well he had a grizzly bear population try to control in these areas but the historical range of the ... goes all the way out to the\nTo the ferries you know all the way out in eastern Montana but but but there's there's kind of the ... and they'll say well just look back at Lewis and Clark ... journals here\nWell somebody actually did look back at Lewis and Clark journals and they're saying that hey actually if you look at the grizzly bear population especially in the Yellowstone every ecosystem right out\nThese grizzly bear numbers are way beyond what they were during Lewis and Clark anyway this is really interesting stuff here so I said that for the nine o'clock hour I'll watch still to come this hour of Montana talks course this hour of the show brought to you by ram rock cabinet company\nYou're flooring and cabinet tree experts really appreciate our guests Matt Vincent former a chief executive abuse silver both staying on the phone lines with us because we get a caller there uh just before the break and\nUh Dale calling from the Little Rock is want to go back to Dale Dale thanks thanks again for sticking around so\n[noise] so yeah you you you are saying that how you think I Want any sex was basically written by the DNR see the deed cue the anti mining a U.S folks that are imbedded inside of those organizations so so what's your what's your do your criticism of them that basically that that\nThey really have little desired actually clean up some of these old sites that it's just about that they're just kind of dragging their feet like they have in other places are or what your thoughts which like I guess what's your specific take on my one eighty six\nI think what part\nMontana is taken a number of precautions and added a number of different regulations to make sure that those sort of messages are\nCreated and that's where where I'm kind of are referring to earlier in our conversation where I say that money has got\nThe most stringent and some of the most progressive mining regulations in the world and it says it's it's so we don't do the things that we did back in the nineties which again we want to talk about misleading I mean that that gives that editorial\nThat came out saying that people should not go for one eighty six the Montana standard editorial board came out that you should not go for I one\nWhich is pretty amazing when you have liberal editorial boards even saying that in one of the things I'm also appreciate it about about the stop by what I wanted to six campaigns it's it's good to see Democrats and Republicans teaming up against this you know you've got\nJimmy King Democrat out of beauty ... new Republican ethical strip and I love that ad they're both kind of\nDoing their fancy footwork they're coming to walking across the field but uh but on top of that it's it's also good to see the labor unions finally stepping up I mean I Know the the you know do you know the average Joe union members been good about speaking out in support of money but it seemed like the AFL CIO has been\nHas been remarkably silent when it comes to these attacks on her mining industry like against coal strip and others in the past but even they're stepping up to the plate now to stop by one eighty six so it's it's kinda good to see people kind of waking up a little bit on this\nYeah if they'll see a oh they've opposed they oppose the initiative\nThe Montana United Steelworkers union they oppose it Montana taxpayers association Montana coal council you got the Montana chamber of commerce and the number of the the local chambers of commerce fifty four out of the fifty six counties with make will say that I one eighties is a bad idea\nWho are the two into outliers wasn't Missoula and who the heck ... uh\nWell plenty enough funny enough Missoula was on board with said that they agreed that it's a bad are really at a initiate if I was actually Gallup in Madison County ... yellow\nYellowstone gateway community which I can kinda see see that uh but uh\nObviously got even a good Alice in I mean you've got ... got what how you got tough minded in South west Montana you know and you know the well\nYeah you're yeah it's it's crazy but you you hit on it and this isn't a Democrat\nOr Republican issue it's not part of this is a Montana problem that would be created for Montana if I Want any six passes we need we need to make sure this doesn't go any further\nHe did you hear this breaking news regarding pull out this morning by the way I did you hear this from a secretary Zinke you know there is I don't know if you heard about this uh the plan to ship Cole or possibly even using west coast military bases or other federal properties as trends in points for shipments\nOf us coal natural gas does you know like a governor Inslee in Washington and then you know these environmental groups are trying to block\nThe a coal transport facilities as a way to block crow coal oil and other Montana coal supplies for making it the markets\nSo there's the Germans rage and saying hey well if we're going to use military bases around the federal property will will build it but a transit point for some of these\nVery good very good that's good news yeah\nHopefully it'll help Westmoreland of spilled its way out a chapter eleven like we heard last week that's good news for for Montana cold communities which are also\nOpposed I wanted yeah so you know if\nIt hard rock comes first what's next I mean like you know Dale Dale referred to possibly agriculture or oil and gas I mean this is this is a Montana issue we all need to pay attention to\nAnd the Obama administration was pushing and separate this was more of a state state level will a mat Vincent again appreciate you joining us on Montana talks working folks go if they want to get stopped by one eighty six signage further yards

her ads are full of life and he talks about how mad has gotten twenty or thirty thousand dollars for insurance companies went on the FCC report just in a short amount of time I found that in this ... this last election cycle alone\nHas gotten a hundred thousand dollars for insurance companies\nSo have you know talking about math when he is getting more than three times on that has gotten and we need to remember it was tested it gave us Obamacare\nAnd our hundred and two hundred percent rate increases and then he talks about how now under mad and auditors office rate increases are twenty three percent\nAnd so it just quits everything around and another group that is working against matter that sportsmen hunters that my ... had opened his friends\nTo the one did four years that big heart but at the big sky and a lot of hunters and the area ever since he's been hair and then we can't forget the cannery ratings where that is an A. rated and John can't even get above it they don't they just a couple of things I wanted to throw\nOut there and encourage everybody tend not listen to all the hype believes it adds to just take math for what is he is what he says he is he's not a politician he's a patriot and I encourage everybody to please vote starting today mature absentee ballots from Matt Rosendale for US Senate\nGive us from uh from someone England a perspective because you know we win\nPeople all they do is watch the ad ad campaigns that are put out here um you know here's the deal like ... almost Twenty years has been has been living in England I mean all these kids graduated from from high school there\nAre not only did he get elected to the legislature and Glenda Glenda but his his one of his kids got elected out of buildings I mean I I find it hard to you to be able to to to claim that you could tell him all come you could move that you could basically get elected in in uh in eastern Montana\nFolks know the candidates in eastern Montana you know what I mean it's not like some of the bigger towns where\nYou kind of have an idea was that ... you get a look these people in the you know them they are your neighbors ... what do you think has been Matt Matt Rosendale rise in Montana politics starting Linda [noise]\nBut I think a lot of it is his honesty and like I said his way of care to be very active we've known that sense for he ran for office\nAnd every day I meet people that are said to me I'm the vice chair of the\nRepublican central committee here they get a lot of phone calls and\nPeople are calling and winning Matt signs and you know asking how do you think that elections going and\nI had somebody tell me the other day what a genuine person what how he always always prep pumpkins into their cars and made sure all the kids in the church had a pumpkin every year and how ... just on their own like Steph cookie boxes to send off to people\nOr whoever they just do all that kind of stuff just on their own and they're just genuine good people who love our country and they left Montana all their home to Montana tester bought a home back east yeah well\nThat's why I'm I'm confident that if if the the the election does not work out the way Chester wants to work out I I think you'll just be fine I think he'll be I think ... will be just fine and dandy with it because he's already paid the way to go over to K Street I mean\nYou know he knew which is the big where all the lobbyist hang out and make a bunch of money are profiting off their connections I think that's where he's ready to go after November either way
