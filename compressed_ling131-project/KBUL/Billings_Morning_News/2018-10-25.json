the the actual you know dictionary definition of ducks thing\nUh so so here here's the story so that the secretary of state's office had to send out an updated mailer\nOr because the voter guide yeah I had some missing information so they had to print up and they had to do it quickly because people are voting right so they needed they needed somebody who could do it the fastest the ... the least

clear if it was clear they're not only the secretary of state's office\nBut it was also clear to the Democratic governor's office uh who\nWho why are you making such a big deal out of this as it's just like if it's because it's because they want to attach a negative connotation\nAnd and the implication when you read this story is pretty dang obvious the implication is that is that while the state government of Montana should not be giving contracts to businesses that are owned by Republicans\nThat that's the implication here I mean I mean remember that this is the party and this is the media establishment that that doesn't do things based on merit hire the best man or woman man for the job\nAnd it and if you're the most qualified to get into the school you get into the school no

I Believe and uh\nReally truly believe that if he gets to Washington he will cut spending will vote to repeal Obamacare and he'll\nBe one of those who will be with us with the libertarian conservatives in the in the Senate and like I say I'm pretty selective on who I'm trying to help and Matt Rosales that I Am around\nYou know I I send this back in the spring the one of Matt Rosendale strength in this election is the fact that he his lights by the libertarian voters in the libertarian leaning voters they're out here across Montana because there is a libertarian on the ballot in his Senate race\nYou were one of ... very first indoor ... once stood out to you about Matt Rosendale back here and this was back in the primary election oftentimes people don't get involved in primary elections you endorsing more what was it about Matt Rosendale stood out to the\nOpposite from the very beginning when I got involved in public life said uh you know are Republicans are good\nThat the Republican Party basically as an empty vessel unless we view it with values and that frankly we got Republicans who voted for more spending we've got Republicans who broke their word on Obamacare I Am only supporting Republicans who I actually think we'll keep their word\nI also want somebody who will defend property rights or there's no reason the world the EPA should be telling everybody or whether they can put dirt in their backyard and this is something where I think that will be a big contrast to test or who is in terrible on these things about property rights\nReally when it comes down to it there are times when I have supported the libertarian over the Republican in this case I think it's a mistake to vote libertarian because I think that\nUh Matt Rosendale is and has a lot of libertarian characteristics and he can win and I would hate to have him loose because we have too many voters going to the libertarian\nBut there are other races where I think Republicans aren't very good and I have supported the libertarian but this is a case where I think Matt has all the characteristics of someone who believes in the constitution will come to Washington and when\nI'm the majority of the Republicans vote to continue adding to the debt I think Matt Rosendale has afforded to to say even when my party's wrong I'm going to vote against the big spenders\nYou know I think looking looking at Washington DC from an outsider's perspective and what's been happening you know the the targeting of the Trump campaign and Trump associates by all Obama era operatives at high levels of the FBI and other agencies are government even for those of us who are defense hawks who see the need and maybe\nSurveillance and monitoring ah in in certain circumstances I\nThink it was dramatically funder touch by by the spying that was done on the Trump campaign and Trump associates hearing all based on the phony Steele dossier da\nDe ... is a fresh boost to the libertarian message when it comes to privacy and those protections for people like use Senator Rand Paul and and Matt Rosendale back here in Montana\nYou know our founders\nThat that men are not angels and that's why we have these restrictions it's the same with law enforcement whether it's police or FBI\nMost of them are good people but we do ask\nYour local police in Missoula to call the judge to get a warrant before that come into your house it should be the same for surveillance we should not record all over the phone call how long you talk and who you talk to in Montana and do that without a warrant and this would be sort of a generalized search without a warrant\nAnd this is a terrible thing that we should not be so frightened of terrorism that we give up on our of our rights Franklin you warned us as he said you know if you give up your liberty for security and they wind up with either this is why I'm supporting Matt Rosendale that I think he will oppose the math government surveillance who are listening to our phone calls without a warrant\nAnd I think we can combat terrorism without giving up our constitutional liberties\nAnd I think back to and I think this is one of the reasons why I'm taking the time\nAs you recall Kentucky Montana that we're not right next door to each other is going to take your little effort to get out there\nBut I'm doing it because I truly believe that uh Matt Rosendale will defend our constitutional liberties and really even you know if you're contemplating voting for a third party you need to think about that has a chance of winning in too many people get siphoned off to a third party Matt Wald when we'll wind up with a revolt fast or\nSlow we got some good bourbon out here in Montana too so I don't know if you can take a detour from Bozeman and stop you in your buddies knew ... distillery good military veteran there's got to Birmingham for either but a a Senator Rand Paul here with us on Montana talk talk about our constitutional our liberties and our freedoms\nSenator Jon tester getting the ratings from the national Rifle Association but also you talked about the national debt I mean when when John first ran us send them back in two thousand six he went after his Republican opponent at the time over the national debt\nAnd it's exploded Jon Tester has been in Washington DC I\nDon't I don't know with Jon Tester has ever voted against a spending bill ever I mean everything that comes down the pike he's a yes vote on it and to what we wind up with is both\nA military budget out of control as well as domestic budget out of control that he's one of the ones who makes that compromise to say all the raise spending on everything in order to get something passed and this is what's bankrupting the country and there are some Republicans that are equally as guilty but tester\nHas not been a help on the debt he is that part of the problems and he will never be a fiscal conservative he will never vote against spending and we have a twenty two trillion dollar national debt and so if you're in Montana you care about the debt and care about what it's going to do for our kids and our grandkids\nYou got to get a new senator I think Matt Rosendale will be strong enough to vote against spending even if it comes from the Republicans [noise]\nWe've had here in Montana we've we've had them in the forefront of of taking some strong steps in terms of protecting privacy some of the strongest electronic privacy laws in Asia I think the average by\nPeople like Matt Rosendale and also in in in a big part to a representative Daniel ... out of the buildings area [noise]\nUm what needs to happen next is that the federal level and what are some of the policy Lincoln reason that we now see in Washington DC thanks to the Trump Administration thanks to the Republican being in charge of Congress and your leadership that's\nThing that makes a big difference and probably the biggest a policy thing that Republicans have done to cut taxes tester opposed the cutting into actors right now our economy is growing like it hasn't grown and any time in my lifetime the lowest unemployment my lifetime\nWe are doing great Kentucky I can feel it in the sense that I'm sure it's the same in Montana the economy is just going gangbusters because\nIt seems that the Republicans believe that when you go out and you work hard that that money yours and you should get to keep as much of it as possible when that money stays in Montana is first and creates jobs tester wants to send your money to Washington and they want to increase taxes they don't want to see creatures taxes for the for everybody\nIn Montana needs to know that Chester voted to keep your facts is high Rosendale with those cut your taxes and that's how the economy was really it's liberty argue that it's your money\nYou earned it you should give up as little\nAs possible to adjust and federal government and the federal government should be taking care of our national defence our judiciary our legislative branch and little else\nYeah I agree with you there in into some of my more liberal friends or my maybe younger friends who say well keep the

U. poll\nWe already talked about I Want any five I one eighty six so now the six ... so uh Yeah Dr ... basically to understand the six ... this has been around since Nineteen forty eight it funds I think around the tune of Eighteen million dollars the Montana university system\nUm but right now it looks like it's pulling pretty strongly are there are a lot of undecided on that a initiative as well\nYeah twenty two percent undecided and if you break down the numbers by age their majorities among people over sixty their majorities among people forty ... among folks forty to forty nine and a slight majority among folks\nIs it seems that has a pretty broad based support\nAre extremely conservative voters we have wrecked were ranked themselves ideologically from extra extremely conservative extremely liberal sixty percent extremely conservative voters said they're going to vote for it as well so I think there seems to be pretty broad base court uh for for the military\nUm I also want to take a moment it's OK earn yeah I've been really hard with the support for this poll and the response rates among Montanans\nAnd it's been wonderful or to do this cold and I'm just really glad that Montana took to it which thrilled to be asked your opinions and that we're able to try to understand what's going on here to stay\nWell and I liked the methodology of it at least that your your mailing things out um and and that's why when we were glad to have you on as the ... as a poll was being shipped out to vote so that\nThey knew hey look for this thing it's legit it's not just some marketing ploy or whatever that it's an actual survey because it's so hard to to do polling these days is understanding is so hard to know or ... who was on twenty sixteen how how wrong so many other

here for Montanans\nWell hopefully you guys keep it up and then going to say hats off to our friends at the Montana television network as well\nUm you know as a as a lot of news organizations are scaling back in and and things like that they'd they'd been ramping up in ... in in ... continue to put things in support things like like this whole so that's good to sell hats off to our friends in empty and as well [noise]\nYeah ... they they step to the plate and I'm really very proud of them as well so it's been great\nWas there one question you wish you could have asked in this poll that you weren't able to ask\nMe [laughter] I'll tell you what very simple I Wish I could ask a question about\nOh yes yeah that now that would have been interesting and here's the reason it's very simple\nThe cabinet Harry's when we designed it prints with the questioner looked like it was a done deal the the issues that have come up the allegations that we're not even on the radar screen so I'm like chicken myself I'm like why didn't we asked about that\nOh yeah that would have been in but you could you kind of only caught a part of the cabinet effect really with this polling soldiers so that could have had a different image ... well and I saw info from from more information which doing religious been doing some Republican uh I Believe Republican Senate\nPolling and they said that they saw a four percent jump prior to the camera hearings to after a four percent jump in support for cabinet who already had a majority support in Montana\nAnd given the the ... you know the anger that that generated does that drive more voters towards the Republican it'd be interesting to see it that Kavanaugh effect is still there are all the way through election day\nWhich I Wish I Would have been able to answer that one thing I Try to do is we have ... categories of when the surveys came in so one of the things that's going to try to go over fist literally airing their and piles so you're going to hurt them\nAnd then see if there's a shift um it it's a very crude factory but that's one of my tasks or between now and election\n... the Turks were still holding an American past pastor in in basically in prison or an house detention I mean and they were still jailing an American pastor but all this you know but that that story got\nCompared to the ... story got relatively little attention and yet now all of a sudden we're just supposed to take a aired all one word on everything now\nExactly on your ... your ... and they had 'em in the case of Iran by the way these protesters I've continued and now we have massive strikes by a Iranian truck drivers by rain and teachers are schools have been closed for several days\nAnd then values marketplaces the bazaars had been shut down so the proof is actually in Iran continues but interesting enough the media does not have the time to cover them are\nIn the case of ah turkey ah of course I'm a turkey was holding a prominent a member of a a religious stabbed his went in jail and this was almost like a hostage holding by the Turkish government and not much attention was paid\nA on that account or the media more or less ignored it ah but ah administration\nManaged to actually um negotiate the release of the pilots there and we're very happy that he's not by one that happened in Turkey thought that the relationship with the United states has improved and now it was time to\nTeach Washington who did reveal a ally of the United states should be on ... and of course in a casual situation they found an opportunity to embarrass Saudi Arabia and the world\nAnd um till the American administration and that is\nYou should be advised rather than Saudi Arabia but of course remember and my last statement and this that the irony of all is is that turkey has the highest number of journalists in jade\nA it is and now they're very democratic country anymore and it has moved toward authoritarianism a on month to month basis\nAnd nobody's talking about the the very very um sort of a repressive record of the ah the one uh administration in on Clara\nWell then that ties in with my next question that really brings up a couple of more questions which is why you know at least in terms of media coverage\nIt seems like this story has you know I'm not defending what happened to ... by by any means and people are going to be held accountable and things like that but but but at the end of the day I think why so much media attention is focused on this is because it's about anything they can do to criticize president\nTrump and obviously the relationship that he's been trying to to foster with a with the crown prince in Saudi Arabia to you and really a critical part of the world right now the economy and everything else but but what he or she should people have about\nAbout air to one in the direction he is moving the Turkish government into because if if they're saying well we we should move away from a relationship with Saudi Arabia and in we should be closer to turkey what are the fears of trusting aired alone\nNow I I I think you're completely ride the murder of a general manager of the uh is uh is really a heinous crime and uh it should have never occurred and of course\nThe way this how he's handled it from the very beginning not confronting the truth\nAnd hiding it and then in commended he sort of releasing information here and there and then coming to admit it just makes them look terrible uh and it it's really I think it's all in age from one individual and as the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman uh things should have been very different in terms of approach\nA to a position newspapers and Jordan and as I Know of course the Saudis have just the problem or would ever allowing anyone to speak up and express himself or herself\nWhen they speak up against the regime but this is an interesting situation because the real troubling part outside of Saudi Arabia is actually turkey itself\nIt has become increasingly more repressive intolerant\nAnd his ... it is really interviewing and thing to enter the affairs of several countries in the region um of course one of which is Syria where Turkish military occupation upwards of Syria\nAnd of course the other element is that they have very much resent\nUs support for the Kurds both in Iraq and Syria and turkey has been complaining about the the us support for values Kurdish organizations so the fundamentals of Turkish foreign policy are becoming more and more of what's going on\nTo our foreign policy objectives in the region which is for example has been the Kurdish people who are the victims of repressive regimes especially in Syria today\nYeah that that point you make too about all of the journalists being detained\nIn Turkey right now I mean you know because you might say well the media just cares about this story the more because they care more about the show than they do about the women of Iran because it's a journalist and they're going to stand up for their fellow journalist will stand up for your fellow journalists are being detained\nIn Turkey right now also what it what role does the you know the the er what what\nBrotherhood and continued attempts by the Muslim Brotherhood again more of a foothold in the region I Know Rush Limbaugh for example and not that this would\nNot that this would would be ... necessarily excuse what happened to ... but he said that you know that to show was the Muslim Brotherhood's massage and there's other news outlets that have reported similar things [noise] but\nBut it is is there are also many bigger plate is taking place where this is basically the Muslim Brotherhood trying to gain a stronger foothold in the entire region and if they can under ... ... somebody who might be perceived to be a reformer like\nAh Mohammed bin among the promises from prince of Saudi Arabia that then they can also increase the Muslim Brotherhood influence in the region\nThat is actually correct because the real bad too are within the Islamist politics today is between the ... version of a Sunni orthodox Islam as presented by the Saudi monarchy and the Muslim Brotherhood which claims to be more ...\nAnd in more modern version of this storm is them and as you know uh the home of Muslim Brotherhood was Egypt than it spreads from Egypt and uh movements such as the most of them brother who does Syria\nHamas in Gaza and values are there's a you know sort of a reformist Islamist groups have claimed sort of a Muslim Brotherhood heritage\nA there is no doubt that the the the woman casualty was going to marry and for whom he was going to ... or ... or\nHas a very strong ties to Muslim Brotherhood this is highly ... who was with him as he walked into a building on October second he was also in contact with the government of ...\nAnd ... has been a big supporter through as just zero of Muslim Brotherhood causes\nAnd cause you'll do I'd actually denounce so we'll be pressured on ...\nAnd I'm sure there is this in is should the dynamics of conflict between that will hobbies on the one hand as he presented this as represented by Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood and there is no doubt that casualty was moving more and more uh\nToward the Muslim Brotherhood or some version of Muslim Brotherhood alternative inside Saudi Arabia and I think that is why are the situation became so much more faith in terms of the decision to eliminate\nTeams just a couple of minutes left here with Dr ... from the University of Montana always a pleasure ah getting a chance to get here he's inside a doctor can't if you had in my ... for the Trump Administration in for\nA ... you know the crown prince in Saudi Arabia moving what would your guns be ... where do we go now now that the crown princes\nHas basically said this was a ... incident in and then he ... when we go from here\nI think on the one hand we have to make it very clear to the oldies that this kind of behavior we\nWould be unacceptable and that they should come out with all the facts relating to the situation or we're not going to move forward on this\nOr this or sort of a a hide and seek game ... is is finished\nAnd we put all the facts out especially as you know that he would in the Muslim tradition I find that he is always a demand that they have the ability of a deceased person and they have to release the facts about with his his body is\nOn the other hand the reality is that Saudi Arabia beyond the crown prince is an ally\nHis body is on the other hand the reality is\nThat Saudi Arabia beyond the crown prince is in the United states and the United states needs to get back to you know eating with its own and I\nAnd in death interviews with Montana's

he was he was claiming to be a hunter claiming to be a sport maybe we've joked about his uh\nHis campaign commercials where he'll show him with a hunters orange vast on and the guy literally\nFor decades has never had a hunting license never had one uh you know and and I don't care if you hunter not if you don't hunt more game for the rest of us right a memorial can do for the rest of the guys more pheasants where the guy got if you don't hunt\nThat's cool with me I'm like no stake it don't pretend to be one if you're not one he got a hunting license what once and he did it back in twenty twelve because it was an election year just so we could check the box and claim\nThat he had a hunting license because he was getting criticized for claiming to be a hunter in that election and never being a hunter well he did it again or MSNBC Montana reports\nEven after Donald Trump junior and everybody's been just a a making fun of them left and right over this deal anyway we'll talk about that just a few minutes here but first we got a great guest\nHey great to be here this morning thanks for having me\nYeah appreciate you joining us you know it's kind of easy pickings for people to just blame millennials for everything or just to criticize millennials even though there's a lot of gray characteristics and millennials as well but but when it comes to decline in the liberal arts apparently millennials are not to blame here what's what's the background first\nYeah well it's not every day I get to a talk about uh my favorite guy Matt Rosendale\nHim as a favorite line to wrong for too long about ... but you up with that so I Want to hear all the factory exactly\nWhat's happening right now uh when it comes to higher education the government getting involved in the sky rocketing if prices you know it is to run for too long I mean people are federally waking up and saying you know why\nIs it makes sense for me to stand over a hundred thousand dollars on a degree if it doesn't better my chances\nOf actually finding work in and let me share share one statistic with you that I think the listeners will will appreciate eight degree right now a bachelor's degree the average cost is about a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars whereas a trade school the average cost is roughly thirty three thousand dollars\nThirty three thousand for a trade school a hundred and twenty seven thousand for a bachelor's degree but if you look at average salaries\nFrom a a bachelor degree it's still about fifty thousand dollars and that's been the same for about two years now it's not trending upwards a plumber a plumber salary on average their first year out is fifty six\nThousand dollar ... how are people able to justify you know I think people are waking up they're realizing if I'm gonna spend the money might as well spent in the place that makes sense\nYeah in fact we saw a mule here in Montana you're on the floor is that we were your ... based out of it with you on the ...\nWhen my son so much liberty safer these\nNice yeah so I'm just following you on Twitter at liberty clip I think it is on Twitter um but Ah yes I'm here in Montana it was a few years ago when we were rock in Iraq and the oil and gas fields\nAnd in a new study came out that that uh the grants from Montana tech you know your engineers you're a ... and things like that but that they were making more money after college than Harvard reds were making so I think that was really the first time when people spend way not to say hey\nThe first off you don't need a degree to to have a good successful career just like you are saying um second off even even if you're getting a degree not everybody has to get the same liberal arts degree or any more I'm so that seems to just back this up when the case in point right here in Montana\nEnjoying the show anytime my calling the rim rocks cabinet company fall in line at four O. six to nine four zero nine Seventy says Montana talks on GB

talking about this when we were just talking about uh about uh about education and about how you can get jobs in the automotive field for example making six figures here in Montana where literally just talking about that just a few minutes ago\nAnd now we've got somebody in Studio with us from City College how're you doing how are you this morning doing doing great yeah and um and tell us your name again\nMy name is cats out All right and you're actually an instructor with the automotive programs at one of the automotive instructors at City College\nI've heard great things about the automotive program there we've had a some folks from the various body shop tearing down joined us on the show and talk about literally how you can go through that program here in billings and then have a six figure income that potentially waiting on the other side has\nSlowly and for our auto body programmer actually the only one in the state of Montana so if you want to go get a job working in the auto body so college and Rick Perry finishing City College is the only one that actually offers that as a degree here in the state of Montana yeah\nAnd you were just telling me uh during the break you've got you've got somebody right now working for ... back on the east coast not driving Gruber we're going for over what I'll tell us that source\nWhile he's helping them designer driverless cars and so he has an associate's degree in automotive technology and um was looking for something different to do and put his application and over there and got the job until moved to the east coast and they know he's working with engineers and there\nHe's working directly with them helping design driverless cars all from a two year program to your program in billings Montana and now he's even Montana get originally in Montana Ken originally yeah that's\nGreat yeah where what town we always got to get in front of dying from bill in very good All right yeah\nWell that's great so you got an event coming up a friday November second I'm trying to think what's that about 'em so that'd be ... but the Friday after um women in apprenticeship in nontraditional occupations a one day exploratory workshop\nFrom eight thirty AM to two thirty PM at City College uh here in billings out there on central avenue I'm tell us about this uh this opportunity for for women here and building buildings or this\nIs a free workshop for any female that can be a high school student it can be you know a mom it can be anybody any female who wants to pursue and look more into working into a nontraditional failed because there's a ton of options and availability and a lot of\nWomen just aren't aware of some of the options and what they can do so this workshop is going through and it's talking about um apprenticeship program so you can go right to work and work in an apprenticeship but we'll also have some of our programs featured\nWhere the women can actually they're getting they're doing a hands on demonstration in the shop so in the auto body shop I have one of my female students and she's going to help them take them out of some panels and\nI'm In the welding right down to have our welding simulator set up and the women are actually going to do so well in simulation so they're actually going to do hands on practical this is really what you would do in the real world\nWith that we're also doing some leadership\nTraining and skills too so they can just get a little bit more comfortable in there\nI'm In the application to when they go and try you know to get a job in this field that they'll have that that courage to stand up for themselves and get a job in that application\nLooking at your flyer here a couple of numbers standout apprenticeship graduates on an average wage of almost sixty thousand dollars per year upon completion of their program the average starting salary for City College\nProcess plant technology graduates is Seventy four thousand eight hundred a dollars a for average starting so average starting salary that in in the world a lot of those kids ended up going then what\nSeventy four thousand eight hundred dollars a for average starting so average starting salary that in in the world a lot of those kids and they'll go and then once they get that um that once they graduate from that particular\nProcess plant graduate a lot of them are going into the refineries or water treatment plants or any of those kind of facilities where it's actually a process facility so that many of them are going into our local refineries\nOr how does how do women register for this uh again it's the the one does it tell us what we're calling it women and apprenticeship and nontraditional you but how do they register for this accomplished\nSo they can call the phone number two four seven three thousand seven and they're going to talk to Sydney Donaldson and she will get them registered\nOr they can go on to our website which is WWW MSU billings 'em and go to the city college page and we have that right up there so they can register online or they can just email us didn't yet Sydney dot Donaldson at MSU failings dot edu\nWhat would you tell the woman or other like look I I don't know how we're like fixing cars I don't like to get my hands dirty why would this even be a good opportunity for a woman who might be in that position\nWell I think because it's not always just fixing cars but you can be a service writer and I get your hands dirty but as long as you have that technical skill and that knowledge\nYou're going to be an amazing service writer I mean there's other jobs in our field where you're not getting dirty but you need that skill in that mindset in order to be a good employee for that company\nUm and so and don't be scared of it because I Know it's big and it's everything and when I first started going into automotive my mom was like oh cat very hard to do this and I said yes because I loved math and science\nAnd here's a practical application to that theory education that I was always good at\nAnd it's more computerized these ... anywhere right I mean cars are basically computers\nAnd they are in the past they used to say it would take three things for a ... and that was fuel depression and spark and now it really takes for things because you have any like comics involved in that and so if you like electronics you like electricity you like the theory behind all of that um I'd a modest a great industry for\nYou All right well ... thanks so much for for profit in the studio here and what and folks

then some out of state company so that's who we are going to try to go with okay All right let's do it let's get the job done it goes to the Democratic governor's office or to the department of

a news breaks the implication from the governor's office was well\nWe didn't know that he was a Republican before we approve that while thank God we didn't so what are you telling us oh have you found out it was a Republican you would have blocked it I\nI'm Sorry but I don't care if it's if it's a Democrat who owns a marketing firm\nIf they're the best for him to market Montana give the contract to the firm owned by the Democrats if it's the printing company that's owned by the Republican that's the best from for the printing contract give the contract to the Republican can we stop some of this partisan nonsense once and for all\nJust drives me nuts [laughter] right ... sixty nine four zero nine Seventy why one eighty five might be going down or not my words that's a that's David Parker from uh from MSU poly sci fi professor all played out in the second the first to speak in a ... a speaking a ballot initiatives let's go to Steve\nIn ... and then to K. J. J. R. Steve what's on your mind\nHey I'm In in light of the fact that we've got this issue one eighty six for example in light of the fact that we can use ... and rivers and whatever else fundamentally and prosperity to deny prosperity and Montana [noise]\nI'd like to know the College of U. of M. is entitled are my six\nThose those those operations fund and always go for the school systems in this state at the school system will be the first ones to advocate for their demise [noise] so I say\nYou're not getting my money my money comes from Montana's prosperity market is going to be denied Roseberry I'm did I Do you mind\nThat's an interesting point okay so so the the six mil levy is one of the ballot initiatives ride brings in about Eighteen million dollars\nA brings in about Eighteen million dollars um for for the mountain university system okay we know that if heckle a mining company has allowed this start up their new mine uh near Libby the New Mind between Noxon in Troy that'll bring in what over three hundred million dollars revenue and wages okay so\n... passes it gives us a you know a measly Eighteen million dollars a\nIf these new minds get up and running we're talking about three hundred million more dollars now rent it's wages and revenues mind but so if you really care about higher education I think I Would be more concerned about stopping I one eighty six when I was\nAbout this uh you know measly little a military over here right\nAnd I hope my ... and another thing I actually asked the alumni ... for this for the school of mines also known as Montana no wow\nOn that used to feature a phrase University of Montana guess what is happening this year the phrase University of Montana is eliminated from those\nIs that because they're changing the school named though they're not it's not going to be a [noise] you like it they're just officially changing named to Montana technical right whereas the instead of just like how you have un western and ...\nThe reason for it is they are still amongst that attack but I have to ask why are they disassociated from the University of Montana affiliation I don't know but but it is interesting development in my in my opinion\nYeah you know it it I Would\nI Would assume a university or the ... it's greatly from prosperity in Montana for more natural resource\nOh yeah they ... there's a reason why a Montana tech graduates we're making more money than Harvard graduates and it's because hey petroleum engineering as that ring a bell to anybody out there you mean it's not it's not because of wind farm engineered now there's probably decent jobs in wind farms to I'm not saying that here but it's just\nBut you need subsidies to prop those up All right so uh that was the six mil levy interested in your thoughts on that across the state to have you know there's been some criticism of the universities are playing politics so do they need to get a message by voters rejecting\nA by by rejecting the six mil living now in the polling that was done the empty in MSU poll\nA right now I think around fifty percent I've got the store in front of me or somewhere or I think around fifty percent something their their shows at least in the polling strong support\nFor these six men a levee\nBut there's a lot of undecided voters and that so the undecided voters ah they they might keep the status quo in place in in in that situation what about I one eighty five I one eighty five that would basically raised tobacco taxes and lower or I'm Sorry they would raise tobacco taxes and then basically mandate\nA permanent Obamacare Medicaid expansion tying the hands of lawmakers from making any reforms to that well Dave Parker from Montana State University who has this lead this MSU empty and Paul here's what he had to say about I Won a five with me earlier this morning\nTheir hats whatever they're wearing kind of keep the rest of the house clean and sort of it's strewn around everywhere around

flinch sorry\nThis is a separate issue altogether um but just because I just got this news I just got official reaction of this story [noise] have you heard about the book by Chris court lander Chris Portland or a has a\nHe was a guy who got in that big battle with the feds they basically swooped in with a SWAT Team and and took the artifacts out of his museum and Gary ...\nA out near the the little big weren't battlefield in in Montana and gotten this big battle and then even though they didn't charge him with anything uh they held onto his artifacts even though they didn't have enough evidence apparently the charge him and processing and what they still said not we're going to keep these sarin is like what are you give me a so anyway he ended up getting a\nI think got most of the artifacts back but anyway he\nHas a book out about that battle and then on top of that\nHe alleges I think in chapter eight a debate he alleges any a alleges that he has copies of checks that were paid he alleges that there was widespread voter fraud benefiting Jon Tester in the two thousand six election and so anyway this would of course be a federal of voter fraud case\nUh and and I know a A R friends on camera mess or talked with a Courtland recently I've spoken with him on the show\nAnd so I thought well I'm going to reach out to the U.S attorney's office just to get some official reaction here because hey if he says he has the copies of the checks if he claims there's voter fraud happen you know you would hope that it would be investigated them than either charges would be filed or\nOr the claims would people anyway I just got a response back from the U.S attorney's office\nI hear a for a spokesperson for the department of justice and the U.S attorney's office here for the district of Montana\nA Clara Howard a public affairs officer for the U.S attorney's office uh regarding my question if the U.S attorney's office has investigated voter fraud claims made by Chris court lander a Claire says our response that under department of justice policy the U.S attorney's office can neither confirm\nNor deny the existence of an investigation so they can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation art uh anyway there you go that's a just a heads up on that story so\nNow of course if he was making claims about Republican voter fraud the mere fact that in department of justice is saying we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of investigation see if if you were on the left you could just say oh that that's that's it it happened it's under investigation or guilty right if they're guilty\nOr because you know you know it's because the fact that they didn't say there was an investigation if you're a liberal means all there's an investigation and they're guilty right we've heard that before but anyway a share that with\nThere's all trying to share some of that audio with you here on the show but first let's jump into the phone lines who was next up a branch in Laurel or listen to lose that many five point five nine Seventy TB you will read your thoughts could you\nHave ... a couple of days ago or you're asking people about what they thought issues that were being ignored in the ah federal campaigns might\nBe yeah and uh so I might have been a couple of days later I Hope you don't mind that by a trucker\nName up that's all right that's why we keep the phone lines open maybe we were just a couple of days early [laughter] the\nUh the uh the the biggest one that I think is a sleeper and I think it's because\nOur candidates are relying on the RMC and the dmc as opposed to thinking all politics for oil coal and that is the seat KFC a water pump\nThat affects negatively or rights in the entire a western third of Montana Republican farmer Democrat former ah towns that are served\nElectrical generation I get puts a a a Americans live outside of the reservation under a tribal court jurisdiction it's terrifically negative yeah Kathleen\nWilliams carried it in the Montana Legislature tester introduced it in the U.S [noise] so both Republican candidates could use that and point out that these people\nI have promoted policies and incorporated in Milwaukee negative aspects to the well being of Montana water rights holders\nAgricultural interest city dwellers anybody to have a well you name it as this thing on folds the courts can make it uglier uglier and I won't get better\nAnd yet there is not a single word mentioned\nIn Jersey so using gene forties should use them more in a house race or do you think other Kennedy ... like like ... maybe they are in the planning on the planet is still a hot very hot button there really should even extends beyond the Flathead a\nDoctor ... that was a big part of his capturing a good chunk of the primary voters as well was his opposition to the water back\nMore right and ah I've seen anterior poll them during the primary there was a twenty four percent negative which means twenty four percent of voters would not vote for somebody that supported the compact\nYet GM Ford they could use it against Williams because she trade it for ... in the legislature got it in the law and paid the tried fifty million dollars I uh to accept the deal then pasture introduces it into the U.S Senate\n... died in process because profession end it\nWhy would not Rosendale and June fourth day both raised the issue\n[noise] well yeah where did you learn to even need it right now the latest bowling Josie I'm up seven and a half points but you can never trust the bull easily I guess that would be probably the first response era\nThat All right hey I don't believe in polls B I Do believe in talking about which I'm at issues and I we train these four major candidates I've written extensively there quite often they're not even real issues and are they are often fall here\nIs a real true clear cut affects people on the ground issue and they won't touch\nWell true queer ... affects people on the ground issue and they won't touch\nAll right well interesting thoughts are also be interested maybe to inherit from some folks in the Flathead 'cause I Know that that topic still generates a lot of a controversy a lot of chatter and the flooded and in Lake County and things like that so is this something that the candidates are talking about as they make the rounds especially in the Flathead or be interested in hearing\nUh your your perspective on that Brad Brad mould our great to hear from you bred in Laurel let's go to Mary Ann in billings next up marrying good to hear from you what's on your mind this morning\nHigh I I just wanted to give the opposite side of the coin yeah ground conversation with\nUm [noise]\nA lot of girls getting in the end things that we often thought the mail\nThis feeling you know what I mean the car repair the um\nRacing cars whatever yeah\nYeah this modern day I think we need to give young people young males\nThe permission to be compassionate and sensitive and the nurses because they are strong\nEnough to lift people and things like that or selling learning how to sew and fabricating for cars replacing you know see my point\n[noise] so so there's a lot and so is the point you're making so as we talk about more opportunities for women and and more and more women are are getting involved and say like the automotive industry and animal recount every\nFirst saw that that that in addition to encouraging women to take those jobs we should also be encouraging and renting from programs for men to get involved in some of the other jobs that might typically be as right it as emails daily\nLabeled as for female but yeah hey let's be fair here well\nI Know a lot of I Know a lot of guys uh you know I've got some Merce friends the male nurse friends you know we'll we'll job ... and it's a great job in in a lot of a lot of guys who instead of going to ... you know ... all the way through med school to be to be doctors there become an ... and it really I find you can get more help from the BA anyway 'cause the doctors\nKind of you know they they're busy doing other stuff you talk to the PTA they'll get it or a nurse practitioner but there's a lot of people are saying hey I don't I don't want to be stuck doing all the paperwork I just want to be with patients so they're deliberately choosing those other jobs\nInstead of doing what they typically been told well you you should be this or you should be that right and so I think I think is probably already happening there I'm a new program yeah\nWe just have to change your attitude yeah yeah and the other point is is\nThe generation to\nGeneration is aging our young people should know that they're older people out here that have things to share but they just don't have the strength to push people around in wheelchairs\nOh sure yeah [noise] yeah there's there's lots of opportunities out there right there now especially with the job market going the way that it is right now and and um yeah and even even when you retire there's there's folks they continue to serve in other ways isn't there correct All right we'll marrying great though it's good to hear from you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "city": "Billings", "day": "25"}
