Center for brain health and chair of the scientific advisory council for the Louis buddy dementia association\nThe other disorder underneath that relatives dementia with Louis bodies and these individuals'\nUnlike the Parkinson's disease dementia patience for that with a cognitive thinking problem they've made later developed motor symptoms of Parkinson's or some of the other non motor complications of Parkinson's but the big differences they present with a cognitive impairment versus the voter\nComedian Robin Williams was known to be depressed before his suicide in twenty fourteen but since then blame has been centered on Louis body dementia Williams widow says he was being treated for early Parkinson's disease and an autopsy confirmed the presence of Louis bodies in his brain\nLouis bodies are a change we see in the brain it's actually in the brain cells that aggregation of protein that's called alpha ... and ... and we see Louis bodies both in Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease with dementia and dimension\nAnd that is called alpha ... and we see Louis bodies both in\nParkinson's disease Parkinson's disease with dementia and dementia with Louis bodies that's why we kind of put them under that umbrella term of Louis body dementia and Alzheimer's disease there are different proteins that aggregate in their brain amyloid at something called how are you\nSo the protein that aggregates Louis by is a different protein but it's very similar in that way\nTends to occur in different parts of the brain say an old timers versus the Louis body disorders which explains why we see different kinds of symptoms in these disorders\nHowever those differences are often overlooked or may seem to doctors to be completely unconnected to what's mainly a ton of problem ... says as a result Louis body dementia is often misdiagnosed reportedly the average patient spend a year and a half looking for a diagnosis visiting at least a three doctors along the way\nWe see dementia with Louis bodies often diagnosed the Alzheimer's disease and that's partly no fault necessarily of the doctors who are trying to make that diagnosis sometimes it just looks like a pure thinking problem cognitive impairment problem\nAnd therefore they don't see some of these characteristics such as elusive nation seen things that are real something called REM sleep disorder where people act their dreams out at night\nWe don't see an old timers unless they have coexistence so have both all climbers and Louis body changes the bright little bit easier when it occurs in the context of Parkinson's disease because these people generally clearly already have a motor disorder\nAnd they're responding to therapy we know they have park and the man that context about eighty percent of patients if they live long enough will develop dementia\nLeBron says the cognitive deficits in ... body dementia may not be as severe as ... but the additional symptoms can be extremely serious hallucinations are extremely common they occur in about Seventy percent of patients\nThey're often very vivid they're visual people will see children playing in their front yard or animals in the house and they can be very vivid and very real looking\nInvolve various mechanisms to change the structure of DNA the code of the genome I liken this to saying the human genome genome that builds you and me has three billion letters\nThey come in just four alphabet ACT dingy and you could imagine the human genome as an enormous encyclopedia and if it was actually written as an encyclopedia it would be sixty six full sets up the Encyclopedia Britannica chicken imagine walking into a room and finding in every war one of these volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica\nBut most importantly in the last five or ten years scientists have begun to gather technologies that allow us to go into that code that master code of instructions\nPick out one volume of the encyclopedia pick out one word and in fact would be to erase it and change it\nScientists can do this in the test you for a few genes now but it's streamlined new technology and while gene editing could someday be an incredible way to eradicate genetic diseases we don't know the cost\nWe don't know what the side effects are but the capacity to change the human genome and this way is obviously a great significance\nBecause potentially could change the way we're exposed to breast cancer if you hadn't been back one mutation rapid imitation all of this is being evaluated now but my book is just to remind our says the precipice that were on and that we really should be careful about moving forward as we answer some of the fundamental questions of what all of this means\nFirst of all move charge you suggest that we should figure out the ultimate purpose of the use of these technologies\nBeing a doctor I think that the first kind of standard is that we should be really using this if at all to ameliorate extraordinary suffering and that they should not be used casually there's no casual role for using or intervening on the human genome\nThe ultimate goal is to eliminate extorting suffering number two I think it's important to realize that we should only do these kinds of events or the interventions\nWhen we understand to a large extent what the genes do in other words there should be a good correspondence between the gene and the disease or not trying to intervene on things that affect diseases ten percent of the time or have a large role of chance in them\nAnd the third and probably most important piece of this is that all of this has to be done with freedom and with choice and with the big public conversation around it so by freedom of choice I mean that they cannot be a state mandate to change someone's genome working for somebody look at your child genome before you decide to do anything about it\nHowever some of challenged the ethics of this kind of research they worry that scientists have indeed gotten to the point where they can play God but ... doesn't believe it's unethical to research how to edit the human genome at least on cells in the lab beyond that though it gets ...\nMain ethical boundary is if you have the possibility of doing this in a human embryo or even\nA human embryo and the future that's where the kids at the most stringent because we do not want to change the human gene pool in a way that might have unintended consequences or side effect that we have not understood yet so it's very strict barricaded but it's really barricaded right now particularly human embryos I should emphasize and it's important\nThat this kid may not apply to all countries so in China for instance they've been attempt to take non viable human embryos important in non viable in the long run\nBut nonetheless human embryos and an attempt was made to try to edit the genes of human embryos and that unleashed a kind of factor worry across the world\nAnd the realization that we might be able to potentially intervene a human embryos in a way that we hadn't been able to before\n... says we've been down the dangerous road of genetic manipulation before it was in vogue in the early Nineteen hundreds when it was called eugenics and Nazi Germany instead as an excuse for extermination of an entire race\nLook Archie says it's a reminder that we can never be

as well for us during the last had our ten years that we are in the air this and that plan essentially we went from for four hundred to ...\nAnd about ten or twelve years and that's really what the

family Detroit and the business all and hair allow\nThe book strollers referencing is her authority will debut called beer money a memoir of privilege and loss to understand her story you must first understand the family and the business she comes from\nGreat great grandfather Bernard stroke came over from Germany and Eighteen forty eight with a family recipe at a hundred and fifty\nGreat great grandfather Bernard stroke came over from Germany and Eighteen forty eight with a family recipe at a hundred and fifty dollars as pocket and the family recipe was\nA beer recipe that his family had been brewing\nUp there in adjacent to which was a small worry that they ran in Germany so Bernard came over and learned how to brew beer and Pennsylvania for two years and then he settled in Detroit and started a brewery there because the local water tasted so good and the great lakes\nAnd he built his life in Detroit started brewing beer initially in his basement delivering a door to door out of a wheelbarrow\nSaving every spare penny to buy a horse drawn carriage and his sons Bernard junior and Julius continued to run the company is\nContinued to be very successful and it grew exponentially during the early part of the twentieth century\nAs the decades past the brewery was passed through the generations stroke says during prohibition they survived by making ice cream in World War two her grandfather refused to water his beard down despite the financial costs are refusing to do so\nAnd eventually the company fell into the hands of her uncle's and father whether they wanted it or not\nThere were members of the fourth generation I think my uncle Peter included\nWho really didn't want to work for the family business Peter wanted to work for the CIA he was hit by a truck while he was in CIA training and limbs for the rest of his life and was not able to work for the CIA so he fell back down the family business\nAnd it just really was that where he wanted to be and the same is true for my father who's a very talented photographer he wanted to do that as a career he was discouraged by his family from doing that and joined the business sort of grudgingly\nIt was under the control of this generation that some poor decisions were made and the company's demise was set\nThe company grew exponentially and really had explosive growth all through the fifties sixties and into the late seventies when my uncle Peter strode took over and decided\nThat rather than growing incrementally the way we had been doing it he wanted to grow through acquisition\nAnd get very big very quickly so his first acquisition was the shape forever and Pennsylvania which brought us into the northeast and then one year later our company which was a hundred million market cap at that time\nTook out a half a billion dollar loan to buy the splits gray and suddenly we were the big national brewer with ... all over the country and\nThirty five brands when we'd only had a few brands prior to that this was a very big and bold move that essentially men Peter was betting the farm\nAnd it was very risky we didn't have the marketing budget to market all these new brands that we had along with fire on brands and we're competing against publicly traded companies at this point and we just got too big to quickly\nBut growing up strode didn't know just how big the company was how big it would get or what it would mean for her life\nAs a child I was obviously aware that we had this company that was recognized in our community at that time in the late sixties and seventies we were
