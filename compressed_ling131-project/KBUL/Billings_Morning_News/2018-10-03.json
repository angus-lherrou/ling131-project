of the things I Love about getting out and traveling getting out on the road and chatting with people in person you know we we did a live show from great falls lumber on Monday and then we're live from the heritage in yesterday caught up with a whole bunch of people a cross town and we were in great falls and then driving back to billings\nAnd uh I think I heard one of the best pieces of of feedback on the show that really put it in perspective because we were um you know at least ... will what we're hearing from folks are not not just across buildings but really across the state\nIs how successful the the show's been doing since we launched it in January ah you know run into folks that will say yeah you know I there I was tuning into the station one day and and you know you had this national program on at first\nAnd then all of a sudden I heard this new show on and they're talking about Montana stuff in there hitting all the top issues there covering the local news news and the local issues but they're also covering them as a national issue so ... started tuning in him and just haven't stopped since that point so that was great to back here\nBut I think the best perspective that I got a I won't say who a shared this perspective with me but let's just say a with somebody I ran into in great falls and they and we were we were chatting off off on the sidewalk while I was in

after the presidential election which by the way after a presidential election not in mid term elections that was a precedent started by Senate Democrats so again Crimea river cry and Chuck\nOver that one but the second point here is how dare you compare this to Merrick Garland I mean somebody tell me but I I don't seem to recall all of a sudden a the Senate Republicans somehow claiming that Merrick Garland was was a a rapist\nOr that he you know I don't recall them basically trashing the man personally\nAnd cooking up all these last minute allegations doing whatever they could to trash Merrick Garland yeah they they used their power to delay his nomination in good for them you can use whatever power you have left\nTo try to delay Kavanaugh's but what you have done by by attacking this man and his family is out right despicable and shameful and you have no regard for facts whatsoever that's been very clear from the start of the side of the ... the whole [noise]\nThey did distant Merrick Garland yeah let's go ask Merrick Garland hey hey do you feel like you've got the same treatment that Kavanaugh's gotten no alright here we go Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton she was

much better and smarter than the rest of us and did you hear that that I'm I'm assuming he must have been some sort of a news moderator said you know I put news in air quotes here\nTackling alongside Hillary Clinton ... oh yeah they're saying that somehow we the Clintons started all these allegations thirty six years ago\nUh hey Hillary these allegations didn't come up thirty six years ago\nThese allegations came up in twenty twelve after judge Brett Kavanaugh was uh was named as a possible or a judge on the shortlist for Mitt Romney to be a Supreme Court justice if he were to be if he were to become that that's when ... but the fact\nOr join the shortlist for Mitt Romney to be a Supreme Court justice if he were to be if he were to become that\nThat went well but that that's when apparently that's when allegedly these these claims first came up\nBut but now Senate Republicans are saying that that that that the attorneys for Ford won't even turn over those therapists notes so they're afraid to share the therapist notes that that apparently document this so it didn't even allegedly get brought up until twenty twelve\nIt only officially got brought up at the very last minute here within the last few weeks and the eleventh hour or so they could try to block judge Brett Kavanaugh\nUm and and so so ... you sit here and laugh and tackle and say oh yeah it's our fault that these

the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer had\nAnd who delayed the nomination of Supreme Court justice Merrick Garland rubber three hundred days without us rub shoulders give me a break\nOK okay fair point here or a ... point\nYeah they blocked Merrick Garland because they could or they delayed that make good on them I mean that was a precedent that was set by Senate Democrats uh several years prior that in a presidential election year they'll hold off on a Supreme Court nomination until after the election\nNot in the midterms but in the president's election okay so Democrats set that precedent so so okay hey they wanted to play stupid games and now in twenty Eighteen or it back with mark Merrick Garland then twenty sixteen they because of the stupid games they played before they won stupid prizes and\nTwenty sixteen and and so I I'm not going to fall Senate Democrats like Chuck Schumer and others for trying to de to lay\nThis confirmation process pay\nYou know conservatives

I. N. X Steven great to hear from it\nWell thank you very much I can draw a straight line between what John Chester trip\nTo admiral Jackson in in the spring of this year and what they did to a judge Kavanaugh I think it was a ... I think it was a practice run to see what a guy who fairly confident he could win reelection what kind of blowback will be on the street\nAnd I don't think that what Dianne Feinstein did was\nAn eleventh hour ordeal it was it for\nAfter the ... but it's I'm so disappointed and Matt Rosendale not linking Custer to what's happening\nTo a cabin on because there is the parallel is striking exactly what what happened from one person to the other smaller accusations baseless charges eleventh hour accusations I mean that's beyond reprehensible Jon Tester may be ashamed to be a Montana\n[noise] it's uh it it really has been shameful and I think I think another word is just just despicable what what they did the judge Brett Kavanaugh here and it is very clear they don't care about facts they don't care about truth they don't care about evidence\nUm and so it really comes down to look if Planned Parenthood is telling them to vote against Kavanaugh he's going to vote against Kavanaugh but I think I think they're exactly right this\nSee they because they were successful in getting admiral Ronny Jackson about out\nThey thought they could do to the same to judge Brett Kavanaugh but I think the difference that we're seeing is that you know admiral Ronny Jackson\nHe didn't need to be a secretary he was asked to be be a secretary\nHe was on his way out retired\nYeah he was ready to retire enjoy life with his family after I'm sure a busy time being the the lead doctor physician personal doctor for not only President Trump but for President Obama so so he said hey I've been asked to serve all serve\nA but he didn't really want the job I mean he is in like a lot of us hey you asked me to do a job I'll do it and I put my all into it but man I'd rather be doing other things so when all that nonsense that was false they was unsubstantiated even Secret Service record ... and he said you know what I don't need this nonsense\nBut but I also so I I I've got where he was coming from but I also see where judge Brett Kavanaugh is coming from oh really oh you want to launch these fake false attacks me bring it on and I think that's why people they love the fact that Kavanaugh fought back against those hypocrites in the United States Senate\nBut tester has no problem at all just throwing a completely innocent person for political purposes and that is a shame of it right there\nI think we've done a pattern don't we yes\nTopic you can even thank you good to hear from you for a six to nine four zero nine Seventy if you agree if you disagree if you're like oh I Love I Love John what's he do call into it will we used we certainly want to hear from you as well the phone lines are open\nFor you us go to John in Columbus listening in a new stock Ninety five point five and eight and nine Seventy KB U L John good to hear from you\nUh she can just get away with anything with the establishment media Sullivan um but but on this note on the conversation that we we left this with just before the break there and I I Will go back to to uh Lance in whitefish it or to follow but more because we got cut off by the break but but going along with\nWith what land so whitefish had it has to say about how how they're attacking his daughter now they're attacking judge Brett Kavanaugh's ten year old daughter and her prayer or for the for the accuser\nAnd just how shameful that is I mean I didn't like it when they did that when they did that to Chelsea Clinton for example when they\nWhen they attack wasn't it Saturday Night live that would basically you know made fun of Chelsea Clinton when she was just a young teenage girl I thought that was shameful back in the nineties when they did that to Hillary Clinton so this isn't just a liberal or conservative thing here you don't attack\nTheir kids I mean come on you know we're we're questioning your sanity in some regards but now are questioning their their humanity here uh let's see Lance in whitefish latch you still there\nYes sir so how you were talking about how you're more a more motivated now than ever before uh to to get out in and get involved in these midterm elections talk a little bit about that because that based on the poll numbers that we're seeing a in the north Dakota Senate race for example\nCongressman Kramer over there is now up ten points in the latest poll or against Democrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp in this is the poll that came out after the Kavanaugh confirmation battle\nYou know I think that's kind of there's not just North Dakota Missouri also your state as well to me I'm not only am I going to make acquaintances going and\nVoting to house people back this line of thinking but you know I'm calling on people you know hey get a hold of your senator or congressman members of the house even here at the state level\nYou know and where is the accountability for Rick was journalism I mean whatever happened to standards\nOf libel and you know and and just being all\nWere meat is held accountable for erroneous and you know terroristic ways of you know journalism that they're doing\nIf I was to go out on the street and say something about one of the local you know city council members in that matter I mean we view me there would be everybody coming at me for slander liable and you know and the repercussions from I Would be astronomical but it seems as though there\nThere is an unwillingness for people in the legislature in ... in Congress and\nIn in ... divisions just stand up all these people accountable for falls ... I mean yeah\nYeah ... not only were have the standards gone boom has the accountability and that's what I'm really you know pushing has you know I don't care if I completely agree with those running whether they're from out of state and they're running for my state Senate seat or whatever\nYou know I Want to vote for people that are going to get in there and all these people that are the old chewing on troops accountable\nYeah I hear you there last thanks so much for your call today um and you know on on that specific front I'd I'd I'd take it in ... and another angle here to wear regarding press coverage and all of this I mean do you imagine if a Republican\nMade a made unsubstantiated allegations against say say like Democrat governors the book let's say let's say you had you had anonymous sources come to you with information and you simply shared what multiple sources were telling you about governor Steve bullock\n... well first off most of the media and Helena wouldn't even cover it first off second off they would probably attack you for daring\nTo make a ... allegation and make allegations may stuff anonymous sources but Jon Tester does it about a navy admiral and Iraq War veteran am hey he's just doing his job is the is the the argument they try to make completely absurd but I'd take it on another angle to which is let's talk about this big trade agreement this week\nMember how big of a news topic\nI mean so often agriculture gets a ignored in a lot of the mainstream media you know because they just you know if it doesn't happen at a in a coffee shop in downtown Missoula it's not if they didn't see it on Twitter is not news\nAnd so even though it's Montana's number one or a driver of our economy agriculture but man they made I so they sometimes they don't cover agriculture all until oh boy we think we can use this trade situation against President Trump and against the Republicans and now all of a sudden you know everybody is talking about agriculture in writing stories about\nTrade and oh is this going to hurt Republicans in farm country\nAnd and now or what have you been seeing and hearing by and large about this a huge trade agreement with with the U.S Mexico and Canada positive reviews from the grain growers positive views from the national ... beef association a positive across the board the labor unions ... saying wow this is stronger than any other agreement ever before\nAnd where's the coverage you're hearing barely up people that aren't ya isn't that crazy or does it I hate to say see I told you so um that one All right let's go to Daniel in Bozeman listen to fourteen fifty K. MS Danielle good to hear from you\nGood at it as as you've noticed a lot of these calls are not really the old than any predictable\nFor philosophy but I I probably will look for carbon now because he's a worker who is prepared for this kind of job for a lifetime\nUm however there to drawbacks I see and this man\nIs on a regular on with heavy beer drinker I feel alcoholic an old friend man a ... and the way he lashed out at the liberals and left is helping to try to think his nomination\nSubject of thinking ... is supposed to keep objective in neutral and not lead their own emotional life bubble up and do their public work or do that or you\nKnow what if somebody calls you what if somebody calls you a rapist Daniel ... he's a rapist and a man just an awful human being and now we're gonna we're gonna talk about him being a rapist on national TV for the next two weeks and wall to wall coverage you just say well I appreciate hearing your opinion\n... or ... why did the associate that with a plot of the left is uh those people are making accusations from their own life or not necessarily a they're aligned with a\nA a great or a left this for a plot just like Hillary\n... cats they're the irony in this case was hosting democratic fundraisers they were already announcing a democratic fundraiser that they were going to be hosting before all of this\nThe coordination an attack against that started on day one of the cabinet confirmation hearing Chuck Schumer was on the phone with all of these George ... a protest groups to coordinate that protest on day one of the hearing so I mean this is very well coordinated attack on judge Kavanaugh\nOkay I couldn't see it as a a observer but ah I don't think that a a new group probably working ... 'cause I did a follow up into his own views in a public or work time\nNo alright\nOkay well I appreciate your call Daniel all that good to hear from you yeah I I don't care who you are um\nYeah I think what we saw on display was Brett Kavanaugh's humanity not the absence of\nThat when he testified but I don't care who you are whether you're a judge I think I think we hope there is a level of humanity that is deciding on some of these cases I ... I Hope that if anything he hasn't even like going back to this whole concept of do we want to justice who's going to be a hammer\nChipping away at our rights or do we want to justice who's going to be a shield defending our rights in defending the constitution who doesn't just see it as a living breathing document where he can come in and just decide how he wants to see everything\nUm I I Hope that he's even stronger shield of justice now as a result of these attacks on him All right next to them in the queue Marilyn in low low listen to AM nine thirty\n...
