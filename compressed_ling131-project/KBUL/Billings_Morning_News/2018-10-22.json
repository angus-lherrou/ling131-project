share that I haven't read or heard about that anywhere else until I heard it here on the show from you so interesting info um but taxes what what what are the revenue collection is looking like when it comes to the bed Texas\nWell I'm you know the bed tax imposed in Nineteen eighty seven and unfortunately I can remember that far back and so when they say that Montana was dead last and and the amount of money the state's spent on promoting the state's tourism\n... absolutely right there sometimes they got a little bit of money from the state legislature sometimes they had nothing um and so they the industry itself came up with the idea of imposing\nAttacks on themselves to use that funding to promote Montana and bring tourists at the state and um so that fund the amount of taxes they collect from the tax each year\nIs up to thirty one million dollars and uh as was pointed out most of Montanans don't see how that money is spent because it's spent in other states promoting this state\nAnd um some of it is spent locally um the CBD like at the chamber of the convention of visitors bureau you know right or they they get some of that money to promote billings and bring in events like the uh\nIn a ... a real you ask about will turn on a great showing for that um they they help underwrite the cost of bringing high school tournaments to billings which is\nHuge in fact they showed this chart that showed\nThat the ... the the difference in um room rentals about a year that they didn't have a basketball tournament compared to one where they did and it was it was dramatic so yeah you know I'm not a big fan of taxes but\nYou have to say this might be one tax that really served to specific purpose and has\nAnd it was supported by the industry it was very targeted not only a targeted tax but also head of fairly very targeted um\nAh what purpose and designation for those funds as well right and just like hey we want to raise taxes to to do Blanco like among them lay on the money goes somewhere else and they're like hey what about the money that was supposed to go for this hour we don't know whatever\nThey raise so much money with a three percent that taxed at the state legislature decided they wanted and on the action and so\nThey um in one or two thousand three they increase the tax to four percent with that one percent difference going into the general fund so\nThe issue of postage rates how how business shippers here in Montana for example are here in the United states\nPay more for postal shipping than say a a foreign company like out of Paris, France and how President Trump is working to tackle all these things that don't make major national news or even major state news but are huge for business people in small business owners so I'm interested in what what other things are being tackled to\nTo modernize and upgrade an update the small business administration clear out some of the bureaucracy even inside of there so we're talking with Linda McMahon she is the SBA administrator at the national level\nA course of the founders CEO of WWE she's in Montana today we'll talk with her more right after this quick news and weather break here on

choose bread crumb\nNews every ten minutes and when and bring this is talk with Aaron on news talk to find\nMy point was now live with\nLinda McMahon head of the U.S small business administration and would again great to have you\nOn the show here this morning so there there's all of these things that the Trump Administration is doing to reform the bureaucracy and and and do away with you just crazy anti small business regulations rather ... what are you doing to reform the small business administration and upgrade the upgrade them and their procedures here as well\n[noise] well I Can't tell you that it SBA one of the things we've looked at is eliminating either paperwork that's involved in our SBA loan so everything now done is electronically amounts of paperwork that used to have to be in play we now have\nElectronic applications but I can tell you what the president continues to do for small businesses not just small businesses but for businesses and the economy in general\nBut one of the ... and that is to help with workforce development one of the things that I hear most often now from small businesses around the country is having\nA enough skilled workforce you know three point seven ah unemployment rate is wonderful and that's the good news but also it means that businesses are competing more and more for the workforce so small businesses\nSometimes at a bit of a disadvantage because larger companies can offer health care plans retirement plans or those kinds of things and so the president charges apartment of labor ah with coming up with more\nAssociation tight health plans and so those are now in place which means that small businesses can go to their chamber of commerce they can go to an association for instance the restaurant association\nThat are now buying health plans you know in bulk they're out in the marketplace they can buy across state lines the Costa premiums will come down and for the first time a sole proprietor\nOccupy counted as a group and be part of the health planes so it's going to bring down health care costs a you know a measurably for small businesses and now allowed them to get into the you know the big marketplace of buying insurance and that's really going to be huge\nUm and I think the president you know is aware of how\nWe need to change the paradigm and our education so that we are looking more at a print to shift in internships from a you know our big businesses back into the community also from our small businesses working with community colleges even with high schools\nOn what exactly do businesses need and how can we structure curriculum ... so that we are setting the labor requirements in the marketplace and the president signed an executive order for print is shipped development\nUm and we are working very closely with those community colleges now to help put this initiative forward and in addition\nTo an executive order he he formed a I'm a workforce task force\nFor the American worker and I'm On that workforce task force and that again is helping to bring thriving industry and educational environments together so that we can a structure and educational system that's going to fit the needs of what businesses and industry need in our country\nAnd we can tell the strength of the economy and the need for workers need for employees just based

to the [noise]\nThe fake news\nThings up because of liberals complain the Associated Press will change headlines a change stories you know they're not illegal immigrants are not illegal aliens undocumented citizens ah yeah that's right well\nApparently a bunch of liberals complained about an Associated Press headline regarding this illegal caravan are trying to come up to the United states\nA caravan of illegal immigrants and so the liberals all complained and so the Associated Press changes the headline or because you 'cause that's what they do a ... there there are the arm of the Democratic party some might even say they're the heart of the Democrat Party so what about this caravan of migrants\nPattern from Central America to the United states to try to break across our border or how else would you like by the way ... else would you describe them other than an army if there are four thousand plus and most a lot of it\nUh how else would you ... else would you describe them other than an army if there are four thousand plus and most a lot of the military age males trying to break into this country illegally\nOh I guess maybe wouldn't call them and army maybe you just call them invaders or what the heck are you supposed to call Amir anyway I have a growing caravan of Honduran migrants streamed through southern Mexico on Sunday heading towards the United states after making an end run around the Mexican agents who briefly block them at the Guatemalan border\nThey received help at every turn from sympathetic Mexicans who offered food water and clothing hundreds of local driving pickups vans and cargo truck stop to let them climbed aboard\nThe caravan of Central American migrants has anywhere from five thousand ten thousand people according to estimates\nPresident Trump tweeted on Sunday the border security officials continue their quilts full effort to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens attempting to travel to the U.S southern border via a large migrant caravan will also describing such caravans as a quote disgrace to the Democrat Party\nOf so ... what about in fact the President Trump talked about this of course a ... at the at the rally in Missoula on Thursday ah affect your part of what he had to say about a border wall\nIsrael as a wall\nMean that you know\nHe said it was Ninety nine point nine percent there were all they have a big wall [noise]\nIn the form of a very tough [noise] but that humor noses and Nancy Pelosi knows this but they just don't want to give us the I Know for a fact they said you know what we can't let them out of the wall because that would be another campaign promise fulfilled\nSo here you have this army of illegal aliens trying to break into this country making blatantly obvious that they're trying to break into this country [noise]\nWell apparently the Associated Press on Sunday this is a a report by Peter ... Hassan with the Daily Caller the Associated Press on Sunday changed a headline\nAfter a backlash from liberals serious at the a P for describing a caravan of illegal immigrants heading towards the United states as a quote army of migrants\nA ragged growing army of migrants resumes march toward us read the original headline on the AP story the a P later changed the headline to her foot replace the word army with caravan\nThat's just a little party wagon little party caravan here\nAlthough the eighties use the word army to refer to large groups of people besides my rents including nurses and political activists\nThe Y.

this point but you're not breaking into this country illegally you know in in in I I think if if Montanans think of anything here these these next couple of weeks if you're one of those voters that says you know I'm gonna wait until\nElection day to vote I'd just like going to the polls I don't want to fill out an absentee ballot and mail it back or hand deliver it well\nEither way if you got one make sure you deliver it make sure you vote it is it is so critical\nUm but I I just think about this this caravan this army I don't care what word you think of it just this image of thousands of

business people ship your product a new this but if you're a\nTo believe I mean there's there's a say yeah we can just run right over their border nobody's gonna stop 'cause nobody's gonna care because they had been watching politicians like liberal Democrat Senator Jon Tester vote for sanctuary cities vote against funding for the wall\nThey have seen a party or a party Jon Tester's party\nThat cares more about illegal aliens than it does about our own citizens so of course they think they can just you know hey come on everybody else hop on the party wagon we're we're heading

E. M. M. S. and my question or comment for ah Grover Norquist this morning\nHow are you guys doing and I talked to go over my um [noise] so I just want to tell everybody that while this while about those shows are over here doing one thing the money to do and another thing and they need to watch the money\nAnd if this work the cigarette companies would not be putting in the millions of dollars into the ads against it because they know these things work to bring down smoking they don't care if you go to Wyoming and buy cigarettes you're still buying cigarettes so they know it works we'll watch for the money and not the politician everybody thank you\nAll right Mike when you hear from you I'm a grown or I get out of the\nMoney as I pointed out doesn't go to medicate that's actually in the actual initiative that money goes to other different groups um so this is a tax increases and more obligations to to spend more money on Medicaid\nWithout the dollars to pay for him there's another tax cuts coming as soon as this as you said you got to spend all this money\nNow you have to raise taxes again he said what about that other money we spend on other stuff\nWell in a you know going back to my point if if it my point is in my really appreciate your phone call but at this point is okay well the tobacco companies are spending money against this well there's also other big businesses that are spending money in support of it too but but at the tobacco companies are spending money against this because\nIt's going to lower the smoking of of of cigarettes well then it won't bringing the revenue that it's supposed to bring in so that means the rest of us are going to have to pay for this this thing that's being mandated by this by this initiative so even if you're one of those folks who says ... what's the sticking to all the cars I you know I I hate cigarette smoke myself I\nIf I'm running down the road I can I can smell it fifty yards away I don't like it myself but I don't want to stick it to the people who are often times a lot more in in poverty\nUm with higher taxes and things like that because you're just ... I think harming folks in poverty through this process but but if it did what he said it's going to do than it doesn't bring in the revenue\nIt won't ever has the Canadians in New York the Canadians and the New Yorkers raise cigarette taxes people quit buying there\nHad to cut them again and I said even like the Canadians can figure it out\nI thought it was interesting you started off the show by talking about a democratic governor Steve bullock you know the things he can run for president twenty twenty that's what he's spending all of his time doing you know we've got Rand Paul Donald Trump junior Kimberly ... Lindsey Graham Cory Gardner all these all these folks are coming back to Montana to campaign\nFor Republican candidates here in Montana and in it so I I was chatting with some folks were asking the question where where Steve bullock I mean is he not campaigning for his fellow Democrat a candidate here in Montana two weeks before the election and then I just saw this this headline\nMontana governor joining local candidate a campaign rally this week the only problem is it's a new story out of Iowa says no he's not helping Democrats in Montana but then again I don't know if he would help them if he joined them on the stump [noise]\nThat is interesting but you're you do need a governor and your state at some point right now you got a candidate for president and not a governor\nWhat do you think about Cherlin switching topics to trade the U.S Mexico Canada agreement I mean I\nAnd it it for president and not a governor\n[noise] what do you think about Cherlin switching topics to trade the U.S Mexico Canada agreement I mean I talk with green growers Farm Bureau stock growers agro him and others and I don't think a lot of folks although one of the stock ... by the president pretty good here but but very good remarks about\nThe changes being made to NAFTA especially especially when it comes to Canada um how do you think the president's doing when it comes to trades especially right here in our own backyard\nWell he's certainly trying to get better deals with the Europeans and the easier now says that they're willing to negotiate down to zero tariffs Sarah Turk barriers\nAnd a zero subsidies which would be very helpful to agriculture and are dealing with Europe because that's not what we've dealt with air so aid he rock the boat with Europe and they've come back and said they want to negotiate to what the president watch which is fair and open trade but also a low tariffs for in both directions not just\nIn this post out um Europe or the expert on on that al ... is affecting a Montana I always worry that when you start a\nFight on tariffs that it can bounce and bad and not helpful ways uh we seem to have dodged a bullet and gotten things to work in the right direction Europe we do need to focus on uh on on China and they're stealing our intellectual property how do you see that the changes are these heavy Canada\nYeah well the reaction we got from the Montana green growers was was basically this is how I kinda summarize it so we're sending our Montana grain to Canada or sending them Cadillacs and then it gets to Canada and the Canadians are saying well those are ... are so we're going to we're going to write those ... does when they're Cadillacs and so now\nPresident Trump said hey we're sending you can like you better call I'm

the balance or they're calling it with what I'm what Brett Kavanaugh and the fact that center I Can't voted against and we had pointed showed sixty percent of North Dakota or with Brett Kavanaugh\nNo I'm going to use my judgment rather than vote with the will of the people which\nIs always a head scratcher and then I'm sure you saw the news last week where you know her big a thing through much of this campaign and says look I'm I'm going to go out there I'm going to stand for victims we've seen what's happened with this move to me too movement\nUnfortunately it's been a in my opinion you know over politicized with what happened with Dr Ford\nAnd you know just the the heartbreaking situation where you see Dr forego look I don't want to be here I don't want to Republican yeah she was outed by Dianne Feinstein what happened with\nMultiple women do the center already I gambling she says there's not me uh being reckless in her campaign by out in sexual assault survivors without their consent some of the women on this list I won't even survivors but we're on the list\nI heard stories were a dad's phone was blowing up when the newspaper I came out and and he didn't even know his daughter was a sexual\nAssault survivors always find that out from friends and a political campaign out of it has been\nA debacle to put it nicely and what's interesting is that we actually were in the field as a company all of last week and so we're release and poll results tonight and you'll see the impact that this you know newspaper editor hat on center I\nCan you give us any sort of a ... or any sort of a of an idea which will be releasing later tonight\nUm gosh how do I say this or that given it away out when you put it this way we did a poll a few weeks ago and this was actually before the Kavanaugh vote a center campus down by ten um it's it's all the states in that ballpark again\nWell yeah in that ... what the what she did there with her campaign did was just atrocious I remember I saw one story I think that the rump board was also a commenting on reporting on here too where there was a woman who\nNow she was afraid that she had to move out of our current Cindy because her name\nHer new married name and her location we're uh we're public place down there\nBy the high camp campaign so now she's afraid that her attacker is going to track her down an attacker again no high camera course apologized but see to me I I guess I I see too many similarities because here you have a high camp you know wanting to campaign as somebody who stands by sexual assault survivors yet just\nBlast their public in from you know their information out there probably but then you look at what happened here in Montana was Senator Jon tester in what he did to Iraq War veteran and navy admiral Ronny Jackson no concern for the truth there no ... no no attempt\nTo substantiate the allegation and jumps on CNN pollen and the candy man all these other ... attacks and so if you care about veterans why would you launch an attack like that on a veteran [noise]\nUm but do you think that that now resources will begin shifting towards Montana instead of North Dakota as a result of of I Can't\nGive it a lot of people asking that question and I think one of the things that we we forget oftentimes is that North Dakota the media here is so\nCheap compared to Florida or other races that may be tied that I think that's probably part of the things are kind of going you know what okay so we put you know three hundred five hundred granted the north Dakota sometimes for some of these organizations you know that's a rounding error although senator high camp has raised over Thirteen million dollars or she clearly can\nUm you know do her own work if you will all over the airwaves so I don't know I mean I think they're probably thinking about it they're going to see our numbers today and go man at a time for us to move that money to Montana or other\nClose states uh but again it's very inexpensive here but how do you like it does have her own war chest and when you see the numbers tonight uh they made a say okay this race is over it let's move on\nYeah very interesting um well I Would certainly be following you via Twitter and elsewhere to to try to track down\nThis race is over it let's move on\nYeah very interesting [noise] um well I Would certainly be following you via Twitter and elsewhere to to try to track\nDown those numbers when they come out later tonight and of course we've got a lot of listening in eastern Montana is you know lots of cross over you know people send their kids to school in North Dakota ... cultural connection there but also in both of these races are are that important um I have seen some internal polling I haven't reported on this but I got some internal polling here for more information\nThat's been pulling on the Senate race in Montana\nAnd and basically the bottom line of what I saw their internal polling than that we share with me is that\nThere is definitely a cabinet effect Montanans already supportive justice Kavanaugh but after the confirmation hearing and and that whole uh the you know saga there there's actually an even greater support for cabin on I think it went from like fifty percent before now fifty four percent strong support for\nCabinet have towards other certainly and at least to him in a four percent bump could be could be a game changer in a state like Montana were were considered kind of a cheap date like north or a media spending [laughter] [noise] so I think\nYou know the other piece that you have even had a chance to talk about because there's so much obviously going on but is this caravan crisis at the border I mean\nIf that thing hits our southern border and world because we have early voting that starts one week from today in North Dakota as far as\nWe can go out and in cash or vote physically somewhere early fat caravan and you know hits the U.S Mexico border within the next seven to ten days in my opinion I ain't that bodes well for the Trump base and Republicans who say look you know what we're not going to sit there and let this\nMob run into our borders it's time to build a wall and get this thing handle and of course change are ridiculous immigration laws\nYeah in fact this was the president President Trump of course was talking about that caravan on Thursday night here in in Missoula, Montana you're part of what are you in and say\nHey vote\nIs a vote for more jobs more well\nAnd more products made right here like the old days in the usa [noise]\n\nIt is and to respect our laws and to respect\nThe heroes of law enforcement [noise]\nAren't there you go that's a part of what President Trump has said the other night uh I I heard even the boost to the ... festival in North Dakota was all cabinet or they didn't have time to butter they're less before they were talking cabinet with these can [laughter]\nI'm I'm assuming you read the New York times piece Romney conversation around here with uh\nThe cabinet situation and and again I think you know if you look at his decisions I mean I I don't know where you stand on the political spectrum but I think you know if you're over conservative I think you could make an argument that Canada is not conservative enough but sure yeah hey we want to have\nMen there is is a potential swing vote and um you know we'll see what he does when he's on the bench everyone thought Roberts was going to vote particular way and then ended up changing the Obamacare statute to where now could be a SCOTUS care so we'll see what he does when the time comes\nWhile I was I was actually hoping that the the nominee would have been the the woman who's Catholic and her name is escaping me at this point but I guess it's probably smart they'll save her for the really big battle if a liberal happens to step", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "city": "Billings", "day": "22"}
