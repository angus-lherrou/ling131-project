S. M. C. A. and so kind of makes me wonder as if this is if this\nSpeech is going to be focused on stick with me through the rest of these trade battles that we have to fight or if\nIt's in part to be a victory lap by the president on trade and in for farm country as well your thoughts\nWell I think it's a little bit of both uh it's it's way too much\nTo relapse by the president on trade and in for farm country as well your thoughts\nWell I think it's a little bit of both uh it's it's we do it's Montana beat farms it's it's corn it's a it's very [noise]\nUm I can tell you that the deal with with China a deal with with Canada and Mexico are certainly helps a Midwestern states that produced dairy because of the ongoing battle with with\nA pricing and retaliatory prices a tariff pricing on on on very so [noise] uh it it it's a big deal I'm the agriculture department economic Research Service estimated that are twenty Eighteen and that farm income\nIs going to be about ten million dollars it's about Thirteen percent lower than a year before adjusting for inflation farm income is barely above the lowest level since two thousand two and and so if current trends continue some agriculture economists\nPredict that farm income could could fall it again and twenty Nineteen so it's important that the president and message\nThat a ... you know what we've heard from other farmers across the country that you know we we know tariffs are hurting us we know tariffs aren't fair and and some of them are willing to go in and dig deep with this president has this out to make it a more fair\nTrading system others you know not as willing to jump on board but at the same time uh the the end run around this so called a trade war with with with these countries it's believed to be a worth it\nFor for many farmers out there\nYeah because the the lower prices and you'd probably see it first hand there in Chicago with a lot of the major you know egg markets are right there in in your backyard but uh the the the prices were already in a downturn in regardless of of terrorist battles and things like that so there's kind of a two front war here there's one just prices period and to\nTheirs in which is relatively global economy and trends and things like that but then there's also the terrorists battles are ... what are you seeing at the ... at the markets in particular [noise]\nAh I I'm not really following the markets to be honest with you um I I could just tell you that when you when you look at a let's say the ... the the corn market right now uh the futures are obviously it's it's\nIt's optimistic on the news that he fifteens going to be expanded\nUm and and when when when you look at when you look at what President Trump has done with Mexico and and with Canada and the ongoing battle with with China uh there's there's optimism or right now and and so you know we'll see\nYeah All right well in fact the President Trump was in Missoula, Montana last week and he was talking about how the American economy is continuing to grow and the Chinese are suffering as a result of of this battle so maybe they'll maybe they'll break just like the uh the Canadians broke as Well Jeff ...

national parks are very interesting read and and she talks about these uh these uh agents who are assigned to the investigative services branch the I S B doesn't that sound kind of interest it sounds like something out of a movie\nAbout how often times these these I. S. B. agents who investigate crimes are on our national parks they'll they'll show up and local police and even FBI agents are like wait your who your with what\nUh so it is so very very excited to talk about this story with racial Monroe should be joining us here any minute um there there's another crazy story out there in fact I think Jeff how in our news breaks this morning has been talking about\nUh some some more of a grizzly attacks a grizzly attacks on hunters and other things like that out their horses we kick into the\nEnd of the rifle season here in Montana\nAnd uh did you hear about this story this is crazy the spokesmen review out of Spokane, Washington has a follow up member that guy uh ... I think he's from Hayden, Idaho and he was a it was hunting a grizzly or no he wasn't it wasn't ... because it was right way to liberal judges say you can't you can't do that\nBut he was he was I think elk hunting here in\nMontana and he got malls\nBy a grizzly bear got mall by a grizzly bear well uh uh here's the story so after the the muddled after the mother grizzly bear finished modeling him after he rubbed the bears spray from his eyes and hyped half mile cradling a broken arm\nBobsled gossip found himself under attack from a meaner more unpredictable and entirely more vicious animal online commenters\nI have never been so threatened to in my life ... said there are literally hundreds of threats wishing that I Would die wishing that I Would die a slow painful death it came from all people the peaceful\nGrass eating vegan a community yeah the ... the vegans we're attacking this guy who was going out cutting a and they were there are wishing that he would have died\nOr by that grizzly bear [noise] um so so apparently he has a meat eater is bad\nBut grizzlies as meat eaters are good I this is the peaceful loving a piece of love a V. guns that are out there but yeah they're they're literally are attacking him wishing he would die\nA now of course all the kids are not like this has got to be clear there but yeah this was a story the spokesman review spoken I shared it at the on my Facebook page Facebook dot com slash Flint report he was a guy who was attacked by a grizzly bear back on October thirteenth while bow hunting for el ... here in Montana\nAs he and his partner walk through tall sagebrush between six and eight feet they struggled a grizzly bear cub and its mother then the ... the mother bear charged ... to his hunting partner great gifts in sand point Idaho sprayed them both with bears spray\nBut not before the bear tackled ... gossip air grab the gases armed with their mouth Claude at his face\n\nDuring the show anytime my calling the room rocks cabinet company phone line as thorough six to nine four zero nine Seventy says Montana talks on TV well am nine Seventy news dark Ninety five point five [noise] aren't\nVery excited weve got Rachel Monroe with outside magazine on the phone line now so we're in a chat with her about that is very interesting piece of the FBI of the national parks are talking about that here just a second but real quickly I wanted to go back just because we we got that call from Steve in Laurel about I one eighty five\nIs unconstitutional is unconstitutional so real quickly to or we could probably get it as a little more later on in the show 'cause we've got till ten AM\nHere but any way Anthony Johnstone a former state solicitor who teaches at the University of Montana law school or he says that\nSimilar arguments were made about edition of one forty nine during the two thousand four elections where basically they raised back taxes to fund a certain programs\nAre in but the the judge and Helen at the time upheld the challenge saying that it was constitutional because it dealt only with the issue of where the money from tackle tobacco taxes are spent\nAnd did not effectively authorized the spending so he said the well the these issues are kind of similar so it should be OK your butts ... state senator Scott sales are added some other things the Harry ... he's basically says hey this is a little different here\nUm and and and I think the different argument that opponents to I wanted if I could say is that a yes this raises tobacco taxes to to go towards medicate and yes the legislature might still have to actually appropriate those funds but the other thing that I one eighty five that's why it's a little butter it also mandates\nOr the Obamacare Medicaid expansion so it ties lawmakers hands it basically already mandates that program so it mandates that spending so they have affected believe mandated that so I think there is a very strong argument that it is unconstitutional\nBut first let's go to Rachel Monroe with outside a magazine outside on line dot com yeah and as I'm prepping for\nOr the radio show here of course I'm pouring through every source I can possibly find ... you know Fox News Politico oh even quote CNN stories and then I'm going through all the Montana sources other radio\nShows other uh or there's not too many out there but anyway and then uh other you know news outlets or newspapers everybody TV and so I'll I'll come across it just a lot of interesting stuff some of it will talk about some of what we want some of it it's like ... that one side and uh spend or will spend a little bit more time talking about this one\nSo here's an excerpt from this piece the nine one one call came in at five fifty five pm on September twenty two thousand twelve the woman had fallen from a legend Rocky Mountain national park she was alive but unconscious\nI Need an alpine mountain rescue team immediately said the woman's husband a slight a clever in his voice\nAt first the accidents seem tragic in a routine way many people follow their desks and national parks every year\nBut over the next few days is is the investigator to deeper into the case several things struck him as strange for instance the timeline the man gave didn't wind up with the evidence and other details seemed off to like how Harold insisted that he'd given his wife CPR\nThe ferret he recalled that her lipstick had been on smudged when he arrived on the sea apparently this man's previous wife also died in an accident anyway a just a very interesting\nRead Rachel munroe now on the phone was with us Rachel thanks for joining us here in Montana talks\nI made it easier yeah so tell us your stories about um these special agents who were assigned to the investigative services branch one of the things that stood out to me from your piece here is that\nThese are special investigators will show up on the scene and other cops and other even FBI agents will be like wait who are you guys you do what you work for who [laughter]\nThat's true that said they work for the national Park Service and I think a lot of people assume that the national Park Service the most complex crime they have to deal with this you know littering um but it turns out that there's a lot more going on in our national parks and then just that\nYeah you could you could almost picture the scene like something out of a cop movie you know when they're when different agencies class well who were you know who's the Smokey the bear are going to tell me what to do with the best shifts but [noise] um well and we've seen a high profile crimes here in Montana I mean there was a a case a few years ago they went to federal court in Missoula there was ...\nNewlyweds were hiking in Glacier National park in the end the bride\nPushed the groom off the plane I remember that\nIt's sort of a learning how many um yeah married couples somebody falls mysteriously in a park and um can be difficult to prove that it makes you think maybe like go go hiking unless you're very secure about your relationships [laughter]\nDavid Wells or be careful if they take a hike and then they want with\nI don't know um but there's no what kinds of a range of different in criminal cases where did you hear about that have taken place just within our national parks [noise]\nWell there are a few different categories of kinds I mean some of them are just the regular\nKind of human to human crimes on\nPeople people who would have committed crimes that come that come up to a park on vacation and and they commit a crime so that everything from from drug dealing to sexual assault to aggravated assault 'em all those things people bring bring their problems with them and they come to a park and then\nBeyond that you have particular kinds that are specific to um\nTo the park so you'll have people there\nAnd uh beyond that you have particular kinds that are specific to um to the park so you'll have people there was a woman who a few years back was\nI'm kinda for her arts I think was doing these big paintings on boulders I think in Joshua tree and maybe some other national park areas which obviously you're not just in the face um\nThe face the nature and the national park so she got into some trouble for that there there's poaching you know so there was a there was a um a man who had a reality t._v. show a hunter who had a reality t._v. show up in Alaska\nAnd um it was like filming handful of shooting these grizzly bears on national park land you're not supposed to do that [noise]\nUm and then you also have a certain category of criminal I think this is much more rare but you have people who\nUm gravitate to parks because they have some grandiose idea of some terrible crime they are going to do there was a serial killer and Yosemite for example and they think you know this this grand landscape matches mine my grants sinister plan\nI'm One of the messages are the two there's this element of you'd probably let your guard down when you're in a national park because you're saying hey we're out here and join the great outdoors and it's a happy time it's a friendly dog um and so it's kinda good I I guess the phrase you could use is kind of good cover for action for for bad actors\nI mean whether it's drug dealers or people to do stage murder because you just assume that if you're in the outdoors you're a good person if you're enjoying the outdoors in national park you would think that that type of stuff what happened there tell us a little bit more about the the ISP\nOr these these agents side of the national Park Service is I is because\nI felt was really interesting is just a few months ago we talked with us more harm and it was a federal judge they actually have a federal judge the ... national park and most you know a lot of the keys he's doing whether these crazy people or you know he's a vice and like the guy with the short shorts he's in the vice and recently and a half so he gets a lot of cases like that but so\nYeah it's a little bit more about the ISP\nSure so because of the way that um jurisdiction is so complicated and the United\nStates with local state federal and and um because of the national parks are federal land the national Park Service actually has jurisdiction not in every park it's kind of confusing but in most national parks so national park a sin NPs has the jurisdiction and so um\nWhen there's a crime committed that's it's the Park Service has dropped to figure out like the gather the evidence and and build the case um and\nOf it's the highest feed it\nStarted back I'm about ten a little more than ten years ago um and it's just a group of special agents that they realize that the the typical park ranger even if they have flown enforcement experience are they were just over tax they couldn't do these complex investigations for the\nMost complicated crimes it was it was too much work they had basically they were beat cops they couldn't also be homicide detectives um was it that you can't it's hard to do both jobs at the same time um and so there was this realization that they needed people who could service as special agents\nUm and work these cases over long periods of time so I'm that needed it um so that's that was kind of the genesis of the ISP and there are thirty three agents to cover all of the the national park\nLand which includes you know national monuments and other things like that um throughout the United states and and they're just thirty three of them which was a that was also really surprising to me they do they have a few field offices but they're also traveling um all around the country there's one that's based in Hawaii\nThat seems like a pretty good gig\nAlaska I'll requests to transfer their yeah\nBut they also a lot of a lot of them were alone that woman in Hawaii she's just an office at one and I think that's that's what some of the downside of the job is um but I heard from from speaking to some of the agents is that it's extremely isolating you know if they're only thirty three of you and\nAnd your mostly spread out all around the country you don't have necessarily as strong a support network um you're doing is you're dealing with it the dark side of humanity and I'm In an isolated place and you're kind of isolated even in your

S. C. and of course a investing heavily here in big sky country because of the importance of the Senate race especially when it comes to\nPresident Trump's agenda back on Capitol Hill up the largest saw a headline just this morning Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner apparently\nThose K Street lobbyists are just funneling as much cash as they can\nTo the Democrats here are pretty pretty obvious that that uh that that K Street is trying to prop up\nOf folks like tester here\nWell then they lose money from lobbyists and the insiders in Washington DC wrapped around the country\nParticularly in Montana I Believe John ... received a more money than any other Senate Democrat candidate from lobbyists\nAnd let's start contrast to a promising worked are quite as obvious money he was going to stick to Montana but it's pretty clear that the Washington DC Los Jon Tester the question is do we want somebody to Washington DC rubs or want somebody to Montana laws\nYeah great question great question from the interests these perspective too I mean you're looking at the map all across the country how confident are you that Republicans will pull off a victory here in Montana\nBut the question is can we wrote about Jordan that's why we're working so hard to states like Montana you know that's got a great busts the sporting started at eight o'clock\nI think they're going through hell on uh Kalispell and uh gosh Bozeman Missoula Hamilton they're going all over the place I think they're making eight stops Donald Trump junior Rand Paul a Kim Jong il world they're all going to be on this Steve danger great senators the veins\nBut uh I I feel that we can win Montana if we work hard enough to get out of every vote early voting started we just need to make sure that we pull Matt Rosendale across the finish line because\nYou know in Colorado I say something like this I said we need to rush of Washington and Colorado and more Colorado and Washington and I think the people in Montana probably think the same thing about it they're ... Montana values in Washington and get Washington out of the way of Montana\nAre so that was a Colorado senator Cory Gardner who's a boots on the ground in Montana or as we speak also All right let's jump back in the phone lines here phone lines are open for you this is where Montana talks for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy compete in jolly yet on the line Pete what's your thoughts this morning\nThat there is a follow up the phone call and already had him for his mail a lot of it I mean I'm not I'm not more and more than in Montana and I've been here for nearly twenty five years I might consider myself a mind having\nA but in the water going back to what he said as\nNot being born in in this state or this light on that doesn't make you know you part part of it I mean every culture in the world at one point as either been\nConquered were armed and conquer or the ... the person doing the conquest\nAnd they're they're very big thing was no health care health care Bill Clinton and conditions says no no\nNo my cats are abortions and all this mean that that's part of what we're fighting for right now\nAnd they found that the Democrats in what are you going to give it to them\nThey want Medicare for all and I heard what thirty two trillion dollar for Medicare for all\nThat's a new low in ... when are already twenty plus ... year\nThen that's the low end for Medicare for all at one we're already Twenty one plus trillion dollars in debt and that's for sure right Pete good to hear from you as well as the speaking of a of a ... you mentioned the topic of abortion that's come up a couple of times already here this morning\nA ... okay ballot initiative I one eighty five we've talked a little bit about that here on the show that's one of the ballot initiatives or that you'll be voting on if you haven't already voted in these elections here in Montana\nI one eighty five and this would raise the tobacco taxes but it would also make\nThe Obamacare Medicaid expansion permanent well why is Planned Parenthood giving big bucks to I Want to eighty five\nOr you might have missed this big news it was buried in a larger report about I one eighty five by the Montana television networks Mike Dennison but here you go other big donors to the pro I one eighty five effort is according to Mike Dennison include the fairness project in Washington DC groups supporting medicate initiatives around the country\n...
