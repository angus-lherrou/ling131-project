kept asking me to help her with the guest list but she wasn't used to asking for help so she got very frustrated and a little teary\nAnd then what happened was she would rip up the paper and started a

your age doctors would say to her not the doctors that we returned to necessarily and then some doctors would say with normal aging process and most doctors would be thought oh she was misdiagnosed with\nIllnesses no one ever diagnosed her with Alzheimer's because she didn't have an official diagnosis until about a year or two before she died\nShe was put on a lot of medications that can be harmful\nShowman figures that for about eight of the ten years before her mother's death she was misdiagnosed she clearly had dementia but with hallucinations and jerky involuntary body movements that are not characteristic of ...\nOne of the things that started happening was she started losing her balance before the jerky movements\nShe would fall and she would lose her balance and actually in the last two years of her life she did get up and fall and break her hip and she was never able to walk again\nAnd the balance issue looks a little like Parkinson's and that's why it's so hard to diagnose so towards the end of her life she would have these jerky motions with her hands\nAnd sometimes we'd have to put mittens on their hands so she wouldn't scratch herself\nThat the part I didn't know how

Sylvie is death in two thousand nine showman has concluded that her mother suffered from the second most common form of dementia suffered by about one point four million Americans or twenty percent of people with dementia\nIt's called Louie body dementia spelled Elly Yu W. why after the pathologist who discovered the triggering changes in the brain\nHowever Louis buddy dementia is really an umbrella term for two disorders\nOne is actually Parkinson's disease demand shifts so to mention that occurs in the context of somebody who already has classic Parkinson's disease with the motor symptoms that you typically see without such as the tremor the slowness of movement stiffness the fossils\nThat Dr James ... director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou ... Center for brain health and chair of the scientific advisory council for the Louis buddy dementia association\nThe other disorder a dirty Fattah ... dementia with Louis bodies and these individuals'\nUnlike the Parkinson's disease to match patience for that with a cognitive thinking problem they may later developed motor symptoms of Parkinson's or some of the other non motor complications of Parkinson's but the big differences they present with cognitive impairment versus the voter\nComedian Robin Williams was known to be depressed before his suicide in twenty fourteen but since then blame has been centered on Louis body dementia Williams widow says he was being treated for early Parkinson's disease and an autopsy confirmed the presence of Louis bodies in his brain\nLouis bodies are a change we see in the brain it's actually in the brain cells that aggregation of protein that is called alpha ... and we see Louis bodies both in Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease with\nOddities that's why we kind of put them under that umbrella term of Louis body dementia and Alzheimer's disease there are different proteins that aggregate in their brain amyloid or something called power to you so the protein that aggregates Louis by is a different protein but it's very similar in that way\nTends to occur in different parts of the brain say an old timers versus the Louis body disorders which explains why we see different kinds of symptoms in these disorders\nHowever those differences are often overlooked or may seem doctors to be completely unconnected to what's mainly a ton of problem ... says as a result Louis body dementia is often misdiagnosed reportedly the average patient spends a year and a half looking for a diagnosis visiting at least three doctors along the way\nWe see dementia with Louis bodies often diagnosed the Alzheimer's disease and that's partly no fault necessarily of the doctors who are trying to make that diagnosis sometimes it just looks like a pure thinking problem cognitive impairment problem\nAnd therefore they don't see some of these characteristics such as elusive nation seeing things that aren't real\nSomething called REM sleep disorder where people act their dreams out at night we don't see an old timers unless they have coexistence so have both all climbers and Louis body changes the bright little bit easier when it occurs in the context of Parkinson's disease because these people generally clearly already have a motor disorder\nAnd they're responding to therapy we know they have Parkinson's disease in that context about eighty percent of patients if they live long enough to develop dementia\nLeBron's as the cognitive deficits Louis body dementia may not be as severe as ...\nBut the additional symptoms can be extremely serious hallucinations are extremely common they occur in about Seventy percent of patients\nThey're often very vivid visual people will see children playing in their front yard or animals in the house and they can be very vivid and very real looking\nThey are not always disturbing and because the medications for treating them can have some significant side effects if they're not disturbing we often don't treat them but if we have to we use the medications that were originally developed for disorders like schizophrenia\nInvolve various mechanisms to change the structure of DNA the code of the genome I liken this to saying the human genome genome that builds you and me has three billion letters\nBecoming just for alphabet ACT dingy and you could imagine the human genome as an enormous encyclopedia and if it was actually written as an encyclopedia it would be sixty six full sets up the Encyclopedia Britannica can imagine walking into a room and finding in every war one of these volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica\nBut most importantly in the last five or ten years scientists have begun to gather technologies that allow us to go into that code that master code of instructions pick out one volume of the encyclopedia pick out one word and then secondly to erase it and change it\nScientists can do this in the test you for a few genes now but it's extremely new technology and while gene editing could someday be an incredible way to eradicate genetic diseases we don't know the cost\nWe don't know what the side effects are but the capacity to change the human genome and this way is obviously a great significance\nBecause potentially could change the way we're exposed to breast cancer if you had to be back one mutation reputation all of this is being evaluated now but my book is just to remind our says the precipice that were on and that we really should be careful about moving forward as we answer some of the fundamental questions of what all of this means\nFirst of all ... suggested we should figure out the ultimate purpose of the use of these technologies\nBeing a doctor I think that the first kind of standard is that we should be really using this if at all to ameliorate extraordinary suffering and that they should not be used casually there's no casual role for using or intervening on the human genome\nThe ultimate role is to eliminate extorting suffering number two I think it's important to realize that we should only do these kinds of events or interventions\nWhen we understand to a large extent what the genes do in other words there should be a good correspondence between the gene and the disease or not trying to intervene on things that affect diseases ten percent of the time or have a large role of chance in them\nAnd the third and probably most important piece of this is that all of this has to be done with freedom and with choice and with a big public conversation around it so by freedom of choice I mean that they cannot be a state mandate to change someone's genome working for somebody look at your child genome before you decide to do anything about it\nHowever some of challenged the ethics of this kind of research they worry that scientists have indeed gotten to the point where they can play God but ... doesn't believe it's unethical to research how to edit the human genome at least on cells in the lab beyond that though it gets ...\nMain ethical boundary is if you have the possibility of doing this in a human\nAdd beyond that though it gets ...\nThe main ethical boundary is if you have the possibility of doing this in a human embryo or even potentially something that can become a human embryo in the future\nThat's where the kids at the most stringent because we do not want to change the human gene pool in a way that might have unintended consequences or side effect that we have not understood yet so it's very strict barricaded but it's really barricaded right now particularly human embryos I should emphasize and it's important\nThat this kid may not apply to all countries so in China for instance they've been attempt to take non viable human embryos important in non viable in the long run but nonetheless human embryos and an attempt was made to try to edit the genes of human embryos and act unleashed a kind of factor of worry across the world\nAnd the realization that we might be able to potentially intervene a human embryos in a way that we hadn't been able to before\n... says we've been down the dangerous road of genetic manipulation before it was in vogue in the early Nineteen hundreds when it was called eugenics and Nazi Germany instead as an excuse for extermination of an entire race\nLook Archie says it's a

stroke came over from Germany and Eighteen forty eight with a family recipe at a hundred and fifty dollars out of pocket and the family recipe was\nA beer recipe that his family had been brewing up there in adjacent to which was a small worry that they ran in Germany so Bernard came over and learned how to brew beer and Pennsylvania for two years and then he settled in Detroit\nAnd started a brewery there because the local water tasted so good and the great lakes\nAnd he built his life in Detroit started brewing beer initially in his basement delivering a door to door out of a wheelbarrow saving every spare penny to buy a horse drawn carriage\nAnd his sons Bernard junior and Julius continued to run the company is continued to be very successful and it grew exponentially during the early part of the twentieth century\nAs the decades past the brewery was passed through the generations stroke says during prohibition they survive by making ice cream in World War two her grandfather refused to water his beard down despite the financial cost are refusing to do so\nAnd eventually the company fell into the hands of her uncle's and father whether they wanted it or not\nThere were members of the fourth generation I think my uncle Peter included\nWho really didn't want to work for the family business Peter wanted to work for the CIA he was hit by a truck while he was in CIA training and limbs for the rest of his life and was not able to work for the CIA so he style back on the family business\nAnd it just really was that where he wanted to be and the same is true for my father who's a very talented photographer he wanted to pursue that as a career he was discouraged by his family from doing that and joined the business sort of grudgingly\nIt was under the control of this generation that some poor decisions were made and that companies demise was set\nThe company grew exponentially and really had explosive growth all through the fifties sixties and into the late seventies when my uncle Peter strode took over\nAnd decided that rather than growing incrementally the way we had been doing it he wanted to grow through acquisition\nAnd get very big very quickly so his first acquisition was the Schaffer ... in Pennsylvania which brought us into the northeast and then one year later our company which was a hundred million market cap at that time\nTook out a half a billion dollar loan to buy the splits gray and suddenly we were the big national brewer with ... all over the country and\nThirty five brands when we'd only had a few brands prior to that this was a very big and bold move that essentially men Peter was betting the farm\nAnd it was very risky we didn't have the marketing budget to market all these new ground we had along with our own brands and

guest is with maximus lighting and we're talking about security and technology for the outside of your home or mark we were just talking about the maximus lighting with the camera and all the video\nHow cool that stuff is and how easy it is what is your website if people want to check out some information 'cause they get step by step on how to install\nRight so which is maximus sliding dot com and then there's videos out there there's lots of information about the products\nThere's also a section called the news and reviews where you can you know you can read some of the reviews that experts say about our product and just you know opinions a lotta times as refusal compare ours to other products in the market you can see out there for a while if you'd like sure\nIf somebody wants to buy one ... are they in stores\nYes you're absolutely the probably the biggest consumer or customer we have ... the coach light would be Costco and the ... the coach lights in the ... stores in us and Canada\nAnd then for flood lights um we're about halfway through the rollout with all the Home Depot stores in the U.S over within the next two weeks every Home Depot store us and Canada will have the flight in stock is well\nOkay and um somebody says is there a phone number for the first of all I mean you got to have the Internet in your home correct absolutely\nYeah this is a wife I based product so you use your um use your phone's Bluetooth a feature to to set the device up but then once the device is set up and basically the device where the cameras are connected to the cloud so you got to have ... for that\nRight and um yeah yeah so this is why it's a smart home if you got a whole life I for a smart TV too right you got to have a wife or yeah All right so what happens I've got my coach light I got my maximus coach light up I got a camera what happens if I have two lights by the way\nThat will ... we have another um another product called the companion light guy basically all of our porch lights come with companion lights in the same uh actual fixture\nOr seem designed same finish that are in in essence it just doesn't have a camera on it but it pairs with your life with the camera so if you've got a a left and right a light\nOn your front door you've got lights on your house as you walk up the sidewalk towards your your front door that you all want to map that you wouldn't have these products old man should be the same most light fixture you can do that and it's called a companion like\nYeah I guess if you had one coach light and you actually at the camera facing towards the driveway and the other one right on the porch you could do that again\nAnd again you know limitation you can have as many with cameras as you want is that if you you know you don't always need cameras on every light but you want to have more lights that sort of match and um for the design of your home and and so forth\nSo I mean nears couple different ways to do that I mean certainly um\nAny any customer can share their their log in and password with someone else that's the easy way we again then you can't take it back so right well we ... what we've offered or what we've been included in our ... is called share camera where you can actually share one camera to cameras with someone else\nFor some period of time and then they can see their your camera along with theirs\nAnd then you come back from vacation or whatever then you can ensure that camera so it's a way to show you Sharon contacts on your iPhone ... and but the beauty of that is as you're not actually pass along your log in a password and it's temporary and I'm In it and you can delete that sharing a anytime you'd like\nTo cook so what happens when a stranger or friend or foe walks up to the door and I have ... most cooks like their whatever\nSo the first thing that happens is you get a notification someone's at your door and there's another feature cold medication or I'm\nA greeting someone someone comes to your door you can actually have a automatically set up in the in the app you can have a greeting play for that person it can be a barking dog it can be a time you can be sorry we're not interested\nToday we've added or over the weekend we added over Halloween greeting so you can have something seasonal and then they automatically here that greedy and when they walk up if you want that you know the winter and you can turn it off or on okay\nNow okay I mean I think of at the end most importantly recording starts okay so no matter what happens the recording starts because the motion sensor was triggered says recording starts am I watching that on my phone that if you want okay yeah so you get that\nYou get to like if you want to watch it live you can and if they still goes to the club okay and so is there\nHow long do I have access to the club a cloud to watch that video\nYes so depending on your level of service if you're if you don't have any kind of a paid subscription which does not require that device works a hundred percent without any type of paid subscription\nThe um the video will remain in cloud for a minimum of two hours okay if you have any kind of a paid service and they can last for up to up to a month if you if you have some kind of ... in the services very inexpensive\nAnd one of the thing I might mention to um I don't want to forget this this is very important feature\nIs that when they're recording starts um you can watch the person lives but when the clip is actually loaded of the cloud we actually put ten seconds onto the front of that video okay one of the things we've noticed is that the the beginning of the\nVideos of critical kind of the the video so [noise] um we put ten additional seconds on the front and

solution to keep your gutters flowing\nAnd he has actually we need points Lenny we need boys not sealing it really does not a big process this is easy\nYeah feeling is a\nYou know we have a water ... that's easy for the consumers that do themselves they don't have to wear any special gloves masks or anything it's a neutral ph\nAnd um it's always good to work in sections when you seal stone because if you spray it on the entire countertop\nMe come back and try to wipe it down it's going to dry on the surface before you work at in and if that happens especially with darker stone you get this like Hayes on top of the surface which will come out with you know react the sealer use and a half its own but\nKind of you know paying to do it that way so I always suggest do like a three foot section but to see their on their way to Terry cloth working at the stone flip the cloth over buff till dry\nMoved to the next section kind of go down to counter tops that way\nFolks that really are like me in all about easy you know new granted gold is making a a three step process even easier\n[noise] yeah you know when we talked about the the cleaning shy of trying to make things more convenient easier um we did launch this is kind of a first for the industry as a we have three different wipes we have a clear and the first and only sealer white stone countertops him to see the waves are great cars\nPull out of out of the er at a pouch wipe the carrot top down buffet dry with a paper towel her claws them you're done and it's actually the most cost effective way to seal your countertop so a pack a sealer will reign anywhere for nine Ninety nine to fourteen Ninety nine so to counter tops for ten fifty dollars is\nHeard of it in the industry and that lean seals and publishes so we have three separate white so we have one for cleaning wonder ceiling anyway even have a polish wipe yeah\nThere you go [laughter]\nYeah it is I mean maybe the and doesn't get any easier and that so where does folks get the grand a gold um products\nSo um if you go to our website and get our started locate or you could find if you're looking for a specific products are but we do have like our core

I'm so courts is still\nAround Ninety three percent natural course material and then seven percent of the rather than a proxies and it's a it is man made but it's with natural materials\nThat you don't need to seal it because the absorption rate is so low uh but you still need to clean it feel ... polish it um you also\nYou don't want to use a any harsh chemicals because it's still Ninety percent natural materials so we actually just launch court Sprite course ... is a two and one clear in college where your court counter tops and specifically made for courts\nBecause it's so sensitive doesn't absorb so we had to work with a formula to make it or didn't streak on court said it was easy to use [noise]\nExcellent so here's another question I have an ... if you don't mind maybe they
