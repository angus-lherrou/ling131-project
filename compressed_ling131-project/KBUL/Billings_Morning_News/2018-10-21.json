Stein distinguished professor of public health at the city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually say most people are faced with such high co payments from the doctor bowls that they are in deep financial trouble even if I have covered\nPolicies that have a thousand or even two thousand dollars deductible before the insurance\nKicks in and even after that a lot of policies say when you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and a hospital stay can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now than did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar deductible in this country\nAnd that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so deductibles are rising and co payments are rising\nAs you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which have help people but have still left from\nIn deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of six thousand dollars now for most families of six thousand dollar hat that comes when you're sick and frankly in danger\nOf losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected\nBut how common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all that what's the average bill for example that's left for someone to pay out of pocket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews sought to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we wanted to know what are the financial consequences of that\nAnd does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do this really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports just like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies we merged all of those credit report records with\nHospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat's Dr Matthew ... associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also co author of this study which search millions of hospital in financial records he\nSays there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise\nBut the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well\nWe do see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average\nMan their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with the deductibles and co payments on their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis they had was that some individuals just might not understand exactly what they need to pay or there could be ongoing disagreements about exactly what they need to pay and some of those disagreements might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency\nHowever it's a little different for those without insurance the average patient is in the hospital for five days or so according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and no till we did go says there yet with higher unpaid bills as you'd expect yet it something else that hurts them the most financially\nAfter going to the hospital if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills and most of that almost all of it goes away if you are in short but whether you're insured or uninsured both groups seem to be affected by\nLabor earnings their earnings declined by about twenty percent on average and that lasts for a number of years so it takes quite a while for people to go back to normal and for many people we also see some evidence that they ended up retiring early claiming Social Security earlier and in some cases even applying for disability insurance\nNo till we did go says that the most ... finding of this study it's not medical bills that put the average family under financially when they're sick for\nMany people that seems difficult for them to return to work after they go to hospital and you know once we saw that it's not really that surprising I mean for some individuals when they go to the hospital's a serious\nEvent it might make working more difficult there might be short term or even long term disability maybe it's not so surprising but it's not something we were thinking about it ahead of time which is just that after you go to the hospital and suffer\nSome kind of health shocked that so serious that you end up needing medical treatment\nPeople return to work slowly and they end up experiencing earnings losses reductions in income for them to actually for their entire household that persists for many years\nIn many ways he says the labor dislocation after major illness looks like a town where the major industry has suddenly closed\nAnd everyone loses their job and then they have to go back and try to find work in many of those case studies people take a long time to get back to where they were before and I think what was surprising to me it's just for how many people that looks very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\nHe almost Stein says that's a major reason debts that occurred during a medical crisis or potentially much more damaging and lasting ... from things like credit cards every thing falls apart at once\nIt comes at a time that's the worst time in your life so sheer gravely ill and running up big medical bills that's a time when your earnings are going down at the same time that the bills are coming in and of course\nThe stress of illness and the disaster of illness is coming at the same time as the medical bills are coming yeah so that's different from buying a house or running up a bill on your credit card for other things\nAnd the other thing that's different about it is that we know that it's stopped people from getting a care that they need and that that can have\nIt's done in a capsule form or tablet form and we recommend that people take a tablet over a period of Ninety Days if your hormones aren't balanced\nAnd it's going to have some effect and creating some kind of a burden to your system [noise]\nWe've found that ... and ... the delivery of those messages to all the organs that are affected and as a result we think it's a great complement to your body let's put it that way\nBut how do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance or not it's hard to say but even if you doubt men she says poly ... supplements are still safety is\nThe concept of overdose doesn't apply to a certain number of things right\nAnd it turns out that you just can't eat enough vegetables\nTo poison yourself on festivals we've never even seen that before my goodness we've actually seen people drink too much water and actually poison themselves with water but we've never seen in individual eat so many vegetables that they poison themselves on vegetables it's just not possible\nAnd this is the the safety factor of the ... poly means\nThese are things we normally get in plants and in the plants that we need the most so we have no toxicity level to them if we're eating or vegetables and we're taking the policy means we're still not going to have an overdose circumstance will just be more stress resistant more bullet proof when it comes to\nThe stress that we face every day\nThe key factor many people don't realize that they do or don't have a hormonal imbalance until it's tested and that's done through saliva test\nHowever the breakthrough science have Polly means isn't something you may hear much about since the end result isn't a drug it's a supplement then Darrow says supplements operate under FDA rules that generally prevent manufacturers from saying much about them\nAnd certainly there are barriers that the FDA has put in place obviously their interest is safety and with a supplement their interest again is basically safety as far as making claims we can claim that we've been able to help assist promote\nBut at the same time you're correct there are certain disclaimer that obviously the FDA has in place that prevent us from really getting the real total message wrote there as to what the product couldn't do\nThere's a reason for that men she says it's important to notice the difference between supplements and drugs\nAre not treatments for disease and these are promoters of wealth\nSays it's important to notice the difference between supplements and drugs\nThese are not treatments for disease and these are promoters of wellness you don't cure anything

between incarceration rate of Finland and Denmark\nSo this has been a decades long process to get to this title of the world's incarceration leader and started really in the seventies eighties through the nineties and it was mostly due to political changes policy changes in terms of\nChanging mandatory sentencing so crimes that previously didn't carry a prison sentence having a mandatory sentence extending the life of sentences\nRules like three strikes laws where a third convicted felony could lead to for example in California twenty five year to life sentence these changes in how we punish certain crimes are the main factor in the rise of mass incarceration\nAnd says that now there are about to point two million people incarcerated in the U.S and it's not just the fault of the politicians he says that the public with the help of the media took a tougher line on law and order during the last part of the twentieth century\nAs the crime rate was going up in the sixties and seventies and media was covering this media tends to cover crime in a certain way can sue over report violent crime focus more on violent crime\nTends to focus on the specific nature of the crime as opposed to talking about the broad picture at ways to maybe address the roots of crime or social issues\nThe media reporting on rising crime rates in a very specific way was a major factor in why the public became so punitive and the first place\nAnd says that ironically the big headline crimes are the ones that put the majority of people in prison\nSo a lot of the increase in the incarceration

S. O. within the next two weeks every Home Depot store us and Canada will have the flight in stock is well\nOkay and um somebody says is there a phone number for the first of all let me ask you you got to have the Internet in your home correct absolutely yeah\nThis is a wife I based product so you use your um use your phone's Bluetooth a feature to to set the device up but then once the device to set up and basically the device or the cameras are connected to the cloud so you gotta have wife for that\nRight and um yeah yeah so this is why it's a smart home you got to have a life for a smart TV too right you got out of my life is\nAll right so what happens I've got my coach light I got my maximus coach light up I got a camera what happens if I have two lights by the way\n[laughter] yeah well ... we have another um another product called the companion light basically all of our porch lights come with companion lights in the same uh actual fixture\nA same designed same finish that are in in essence it just doesn't have a camera on it but it pairs with your life with a camera so if you've got a a left and right a light\nOn your front door you've got lights on your house as you walk up the sidewalk towards your your front door that you all want a map that you want to have these parks oh man should be the same light fixture you can do that and it's called a companion like\nYeah I guess if you had one coach light and you actually at the camera facing towards the driveway and the other one right on the porch you could do that again\nAnd again you know a limitation you can have as many with cameras as you want is that if you you know you don't always need cameras on every light but you want to have more lights that sort of match and um for the design of your home and and so forth and have the other lights where you need lighting up so we offer the companion lights um cuss words like that\nNow here's a question if my daughter has not in my home town and she said enough to the beach she's not gonna ever phone with her can I can I be paired with her life and cameras shin I'll watch our house chores I mean nears couple different ways to do that I mean certainly um\nCan share their their logging and password with someone else that's the easy way but we again then you can't take it back so well we ... what we've offered or what we've been included in our ... is called share camera\nWhere you can actually share one camera to cameras with someone else for some period of time and then they can see their your camera along with theirs and then when you come back from vacation or whatever then you can ensure that camera so it's a way to share my you're sharing contacts on your iPhone ... and ... and but the beauty of ...\nIn the past where it's temporary and I'm In it and you can delete that sharing a anytime you'd like to\nCook so what happens when a stranger or friend or foe walks up to the door and I have ... took like their whatever\nSo the first thing that happens is you get a notification someone's at your door and there's another feature cold medication or I'm\nA greeting so when someone comes to your door you can actually have a automatically set up in the in the app you can have a greeting play for that person it can be a barking dog it can be a time you can be sorry we're not interested\nToday we've added or over the weekend we had an over Halloween greeting so you can have something seasonal and they automatically here that greedy and when they walk up if you want that you know the winter and you can turn it off or on okay\nNow okay I mean I think of that and most importantly recording start okay so no matter what happens the recording starts because the motion sensor was triggered says recording starts am I watching that on my cousin that if you want okay yeah so you get that you get to like if you want to watch it live you can and if anyone is still goes to the club\nOkay and so is there a how long do I have access to the club a cloud to watch that\nVideo yes so depending on your level of service if you're if you don't have any kind of a page subscription which is not required device works at a hundred percent without any type of paid subscription\nThe um the video were men cloud for a minimum of two hours okay if you have any kind of a paid service and they can last in the cloud for up to up to a month if you if you have some kind of ... in the services very inexpensive\nAnd one of the thing I might mention to um I don't want to forget this this is very important feature\nIs that when they're recording starts um you can watch the person lives but when the clippers actually loaded of the cloud we actually put ten seconds onto the front of that video okay one of the things we've noticed is that the the beginning the\nVideos of a critical time motive for the video so um we put ten additional seconds on the front end do you actually miss anything\nVery good marketing is my guest he is with maximus lightning Randy Diane she'll please hang on I'll get your calls right on the other side of the break your at home with Gary seldom [noise]\nLevel it had no problem for Gary Cohn wind hundred eighty three taught us how white Gary selling\nDog Ninety five point five [noise]\nYou\nHear a Lenny with me talking about a granite gold and many of us have granted counter tops now and uh there needs to be

ordinary household cleaners that actually breaks down that protect the feeling that you have on there but also where's the finish\nI mean I don't think of the chair okay well ... actually today marks\nReady to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYeah so one one featured we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home no matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone and says that the the cameras off line\nSo at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's easier either their wife eyes out okay or the power's out we don't offer um any type of supplemental power at this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that\nI'm interested but we don't we did this point it does need power to to operate\nInterests and he had all kinds of issues there [laughter] that's wonderful though [laughter] All right um I just had a thought and\nJust that just ran out of my brain so we'll go to Tom\nTom welcome thank you Gary thank you thank you so much a question about system if it offers any kind of a local storage you don't have the video store the cloud [noise]\nYeah so we were strictly a wife byproduct um there are other products I'm On the market lower tech products that offer a local storage and um there's just so many limitations with local storage can you know mainly the biggest says you can't really you can't really view the\nThe independent which when you have you really can view it when you're somewhere else where you've got a full was a actual card if some sort but there is no local storage it's all it's all cloud based so this allows you to to view the activity from any place at any time in the world basically\nOkay well I just I just thought what for storage being fairly cheap maybe there was a way to plug it like a Usb drive or something like that on a different note on the wife I network in the house but my\nWell that's a good that's a good deceit gesture so you're saying offer an additional storage um keep it wife I base but offer some external storage that's and that's a good uh that's a good suggestion I mean you can you can download the videos and for them and save them um anytime but it is a good suggestion appreciate that I write that down\nThanks Tom ... to call 'em now we're\nGoing to go real anti technical okay because it's a Gary question I got all the cameras going on I got motion detectors can I just turned a porch light on of course that's a great\nQuestion yeah so beyond the\nThe camera functionality the video functionality it's a smart light so I'm within the ... um you can\nUm there's two things you can set a schedule for the light you can turn it off and on on demand ticket and you can also satellite schedule like dusted on or a specific time you'd like to like to go on or off and then the other the other features what you'd like to like to do when there's motion you went to ... motion\nAll the time just at nighttime or whatever but yeah so you so it's a smart light in addition to having the camera capabilities\nYou can have a lot of fun with that out by no I mean there's all kinds of features that's awesome that's awesome [laughter]\nAll right to mark kind of cut his my guess he is with smart

where the humidity's coming from my gosh you know it's water vapor so can be coming from just about anywhere\nIt could be coming from across space if you got to crawl space there it could become just from a\nYou know showers and using the dish washer and dryer and people in the house if you got a tightly sealed home and you're not using ventilation fans you could get sixty percent easily\nA catcher so I guess I guess my biggest thing was is I don't understand\nHow they so many houses around nearby how come they don't have the same ...\nWell no well the difference would be ... and I'll use a very simplistic not saying this is what's going on in your house but let's see in your house you had three teenage daughters and\nDifference would be like and I use a very simplistic not saying this is what's going on in your house but let's say in your house you had three teenage daughters\nAnd teenage daughters take showers for forty minutes for hate and it's usually ... and let's say they don't turn on the fan you then have a huge humidity problem but if your neighbors don't have teenage daughter's not just picking on teenage daughters but maybe there's one or two people in the house\nAnd they're real careful about always having the ventilation fan on\nA for a half hour after the showers and they turn to fans on when they're cooking and drivers vent it out and\nTheir houses and really a real super whether tight they don't have any humidity issue they may have a few where they'll issue but then on every minute issue\nA I got you know if your air can if you're crawl spaces not conditioned what I mean by that remember the other guy was saying he had this whole uh crawl space and caps later the plastic underground plus to get on the walls that said are the ants were closed up\nOkay if you're home didn't have that and your neighbors did you get the humidity issues so there's things you can do to control and knock down the potential for having humidity issues\nI got you\nAnd I would start with a simple ones again I don't know what's your status on across basis but see if that is in caps laid sea of\nYou know you can eliminate any ground moisture coming up and then I'd ... really concentrate on ventilation fans within the house again\nArab by her mother by but most people turn on their fan um when they shared but then they turn it off it really should run by half hour after the shower for all half hour afterwards as far as the closets and stuff maybe the doors to tied to the carpet\nMaybe we need to get some ventilation in nearby they're putting a vet and the door or shorten the door by half ... so we can get some air ventilation and air if that closet a war\nZone and outside wall maybe they'd say would house and we get some uh ... moisture can come in that way too [noise] so he just got the process of elimination\nIs the best way to tackle that issue [noise] alright coming up next we're going to have our friends in from middle sake we're

Nineteen years ago you built it or someone else someone else though a friend of mine actually I've got that you just build a couple of times a year and so we kind of did it encountered so um\nI had a a\nFifteen Years this which went bad waltz which I went to replace it and I pull the switch out and it's a three way well switch\nAnd that means there's two switches working one light\nAnd I'm going there is no three way wall switch on this there's not another switch there's only one switch that works those lights\nWhat in the world's going on\nSo I call a buddy of mine who was an electrician and I said listen there is just one switch at work she's lights but it's a three way switch in there and I can't remember now whether there's two whereas it was it was it was on the situation was odd\nAnd I said what what do I do and he said ... by a three way switching weren't exactly the way it's word I said but there is no other sweat you just do it at work is okay so I go home turn off the power I'd do it\nAnd I'm like it was his set up and I um put it in it worked forgot all about it there is no second switch\nWell\nAbout four years later hey K this summer I'm uh putting the TV above the

insulating um I heard a I'm In a kick out by a carpet\nIn a bedroom at about ... very close with a lot of air movement underneath a house and taught hardwood floor I heard of an interesting point here in our town\nYeah it's more of a rather than an insulating pain it's more like a ... barrier pain so it\nMinimizes\nUm solar heat gain and also reduces a kind of keeps the heat in the room it's usually a ceramic based paint\nA reflective I'm so they're so there's some marginal benefit to it um I'm not saying it's but it's not really an insult later it's it's more of a\nIt's like a ... it's like you kind of ... bottles you will\nRight right okay Hi what's underneath that wood floor\n[laughter] um it's an open state storage like eBay and\nIs it a basement or is it across space\nThe story force I've actually been to now because we just made a commercial you and I sometimes go a chair and Williams about that paint the inflating paint okay\nBut this story is about a half a friend of mine bought a long time ago and the state famine is full of junk that one room in the basement and he happened to notice all the sticker saying he's getting ready to get rid of it and he couldn't imagine why they had these little Sacred Heart stickers on all of these pictures and can you know a three star to open them and everyone was still with silver certificate\nNo yeah he must pay for his whole house\nNo yeah it was that when it was or if it gets its silver certificates were really valuable because now I don't think they are as valuable as they were maybe twenty five years ago\nIt this has been every bit of thirty thirty\nFive year oh my gosh and how many boxes of these scans the fine\n... did a while he found thousands of dollars worth of an actual money yeah and and so and at the house was in bad shape so I mean the house with a low cost but he\n... he was gonna say he's got a bigger remodeling budget now has a great story Mike thanks very very good how 'bout that [laughter] Martin welcome Gary ...\nGot a disturbing story here about a find a that happened here in our local area of doctor had been accused of abusing children ...\nAnd no evidence I mean there were many complaints I think he was even tried never convicted as far as I remember this was quite a few years ago mhm he passed away in house with salt\nAnd [noise] I forget how many times to how to clean hands and finally somebody decided three model the basement and same thing there appear to be a\nWhole fall though boy they cut into it\nAnd I'll call all the evidence from the all the ... why\nIs that right yeah yeah and he was long gone with long he was already paying the price of\nGood story there's a lot of things that uh I think are hidden in a lot of homes in some homes\nI told the story about just a crazy light switch story at my home which I still can't get over that we never knew this which was there and we were involved in building a house but uh yeah secrets or certainly stored in homes and when you buy a home and you start moving in a home ah people do find\nSome odd things that were going on or maybe just the things that you didn't expect to find so they've got a story like that share it it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five\nAnd got a question regarding your home sure you can calls also at eight hundred eighty two three to five ...\nNot a bad time either to be thinking we ... we started off the show we were talking about maximus lighting and then we went into we started talking about are all kinds of things for your home chimneys chimney repair also not a bad idea\nSometime next week or to get up and down daddy\nTake a look at your insulation I just do a quick addict inspection maybe if you get a furnace up in the addict and their handler but when that guy comes to take care of that problem are going to give it its annual maintenance\nGive me a yardstick and just say around there just just double checking them much insulation I have up there and again you can find with the department of energy a recommends for every inch it insulation it's usually like in our three and be being very general but if the department of energy saying and are forty two\nNow you might find out you got some work you need to do to make that home as efficient as you can but that's one of the things you can put on your list or to get done and again as I speak about often if there's no\nPaper beyond the bottom these are living quarters which is what's supposed to happen but if there's no vapor brown the top which there should not be a gold by and insulation whether they prepare you don't want to have a vapor beer in the middle of the insulation\nThat's important that's how you can trap water in the insulation we don't want to do that so if you have a um fiberglass insulation with a vapor beer vapor barrier facing down the house question I get asked often is can I add right on top of that and the answers absolutely you can blow within you can buy bats\nAh just don't put any vapor beer in between the two um pieces of insulation that's where you get in trouble and don't cover up all that solves admitting around your house or maybe even get samples if you don't have 'em where you can keep that insulation from blowing over uh the soft accent so\nThat's a little tip for you and not a bad time of year to kinda inspect and see what's going on along with\nJust seeing what kind of shape or you're a weather stripping Jim All right we're going to take a break in a bubble put you on hold we'll give you the\nPhone number is eight

got a garden I've been recommending for years\n... all of a insulation mhm so is that breed them all [noise]\nWell no I don't think it would be um how sick is that insulation ... it's not over three inches thick because\nI couldn't tell I wouldn't know without carrying the sitar pay for the call faces a giant that can be okay\nThere is more than a foot of they were putting a basement under house ran into Iraq there's more than a foot of crushed rock on the floor some plastic walls have been painted feel with some things\nAnd three sides in this house the ground subs away from it anyway so\nIt sounds like you get a really good situation but you're just a little concerned about the wallpaper or tar paper\nRight right it is\nBeating here's what I Would say about this you ever hear the phrase don't fix it if it's not broken absolutely not believe in it was so that's\nBeen functioning and you've had no moisture you would if you were there probably would moisture you their problem with mold and you've experienced none of them my guess is if you ... if you double vapor barrier in insulated wall\nAnd you don't extend beyond three inches of insulation you're not going to have a problem I guess as you probably go to three inches of ... the daughter papers\nNot cause we're on the issue at all you gotta you gotta be per beer on the outside part of that's who's totally new beeper getting in between in any way\nWell here's the other thing that's houses being remodeled when I bought it carpet had been down they tore the carpet up I had the floors rate than east they're beautiful every Borg no space no you know there there's no sign of moisture ever affecting this it's it's red oak flooring\nAnd I felt like if there was moisture on that under the house\nYou would have had problems with the wood floor\nI Would think of what it is down in the wood floor\nAbsolutely you would've okay it's the canary in the mine let me tell you that would float would react to a high water content for sure\nOkay great oh and by the way they're here to your house story um there's two houses ones in Hamilton one and liberty township when they were tearing these houses down and they found log cabin\nOne of the cabins them on and liberty township sits on the corner of liberty Fairfield road in Princeton well maintained\nSo they build a house over a cabin\nYeah these are old house is one of
