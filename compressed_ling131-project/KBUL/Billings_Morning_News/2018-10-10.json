stepped into it and once again\nA lot just him but but now his uh communication\nThe night this is a huge huge uptake here in the U.S Senate race here in Montana the\nNational Rifle association\nHas downgraded Senator Jon Tester's ranking to de So Jon tester now has a de ranking from the national Rifle Association or they just uh announces news yesterday so very very big news here\nIn Montana a Senate race or the national Rifle Association about fourteen hours ago sent this out via Twitter\nA downgrading senator testers rating to de after he voted against confirming judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court or the United states\nThe national Rifle Association ... association saying that Jon Tester cannot be trusted to stand with President Trump and support our fundamental right to self defense this was according to Chris Cox with the in our a so so of course the uh the spokesperson\nFor for a Senator Jon tester was lashing out or as a result of this and so so the spokesperson protesters or does he had to end this thing this has gone viral I mean does the spokesperson for for testers is a is just\nKind of get mocked left and right I mean even the liberals alike oh buddy the visuals on this year anyway\nSo he tries to take a shot shot at at at Matt Rosendale and he says well Jon Tester was making a living shooting hundreds of cows and hogs so I think Montanans know who gets guns\nAnd it's like okay so here's this guy who you know it has absolutely lost it\nJon Tester does not get the second amendment does not support\nThe second amendment now he gets a de grade from the n._r._a.\nBut hey I shoot cows ... the feds oh so so if you go out and shoot shoot some cows and shoot some pigs your your that's all you need for this that's what the second amendment's all about right this second about the second amendment is all about just going out back\nAnd shoot in old ... you know that's that's okay it has nothing to do with you know defending from tyranny\nDefending yourself from from maybe say I don't know illegal alien meth dealers that you know the good night\nWho was a one term liberal senator and they would now be called a blue state who was defeated because he was the major sponsor of the ah Nineteen sixty a gun control act that Lyndon Johnson put through a back in the day\nA he said later well I don't know why they're against me I shoot ducks well whether you shoot\nDucks or shoot cattle or shoot anything else is not as relevant as whether you think other folks ought to have a right to own\nFirearms use them for legal purposes and whether or not you believe in the protections of the constitution so\nThat's a a sort of an attempted humorous diversion but I don't think anybody can take seriously\nYeah well normally we would do a a news and weather break right now but actually it's been since we've got David Keene a former chairman right the German or president of the un or other president that's what I okay\nI can use the two but either way you play secular Montana so you make it back to the state but a\nLarge met over two months there this year and if it were up to me I'd spend more time there and I'd be there right now\nAll of that yeah he went on to telecommute that's what everybody's doing all the kids are doing these days you know yeah [laughter] well can you do and as for a few more minutes I I really pure avenue ... quick email late last night is all this news ah was breaking\nAnd so I appreciate you joining us from Washington DC Yeah David Keene a former president of the n._r._a. or also started up the American Conservative Union a heavy hit her back in Washington D.C.'s the opinion page editor for the Washington Times\nAnd it just always at an honor to have him on the show here um\nSo how big of a game changer ... do you think the Kavanaugh hearings or a Republican and we've seen some of the polling coming out of North Dakota do you think we'll see similar impact in a boost the Republican candidate here in Montana\nDo you do that a ... term elections off\nMid term elections are determined question ... votes because of the voting percentages down for presidential years uh and so the\nReal question is which party's base is motivated the Democratic base has been motivated because they don't like Donald Trump and their leadership does have liked\nWhich party's base is motivated\nThe Democratic base has been motivated because they don't like Donald Trump and their leadership doesn't like Donald Trump\nOr the Republican base has been relatively happy before the calving of vote there was something like a in terms of intensity and willingness to vote or anxious to get out and vote there was like a twelve o spread between the parties with a democratic advantage\nAfter the Kavanaugh hearings it was even and what's happened is that the the Democrats by overreaching\nOr have managed to innovate the Republican base so that the great advantage that they thought they were going to have going into November is dissipating in state after state\nUh it's it depends on where you are it depends on what race you are involved in a but the uh the the fact is that from a political tactical standpoint\nOf the way the Democrats handled all of this the the transparency of what they were trying to do\nHas a has not to do what it has done is it's energize the Republican opposition and they and instead of learning that lesson in the days afterward as these polls come in they've doubled down\nA show that they're saying if we get the house which they hope to do they're going to go back we're going to impeach judge Kavanaugh how we're going to issue a hundred and fifty subpoenas we're going to get everybody\nUp there we're going to close down this administration so\nThey have they have essentially a done a lot of work for the Republicans by as the as the voters out there looking at this they say oh my lord are we in for\nAre we in for two more years of this sort of thing with no attention to the country's problems so I think that ... it's at a major impact we don't know how these elections are going to come out because\nBoth of the Senate and house level there are so many races that are right on the edges is going to ... is the ... the races are going to be determined by who votes and by the way in which these folks have handled\nThe ah the Kavanaugh nomination they've made it more rather than less likely that the Republicans are going to win a lot of those races\nAnd now Hillary Clinton saying you can't be civil was a political party that wants to destroy would you stand for she was asked well what about these accusations against Kavanaugh your husband and accusations against him that well that's different she I think there is more\nOf them and they were and they were ever\nThan it was around writing evidence yeah they are ... or ... or was there a blue dress or does seem to have a little bit of evidence there but uh yeah I'm\n... I Wonder too it back to the ... elections when Mitt Romney was running against Barack Obama and\nJustice Roberts basically sided with the liberals on the Supreme Court to basically say that that that provision of Obamacare was constitutional\nI I feel like that depressed the conservative vote because they said well what difference does it make if we you know vote for Republicans and and yet the Democrats felt the bowl because they felt that they were justified with Obamacare\nUm I I Wonder if this might play out in a similar fashion to where the the ... the Democrats got their base all inflamed only to let them down and failure at the end whereas whereas conservatives still like All right are are ... finally didn't cave they stood by their nominee and and they once\nI think that's a large part of it and I think that the uh the judge Kavanaugh's decision not to take the attacks on him laying down\nA both shocks the liberals and the Senate and was what energize the Republican base a and ... and when the Democrats complained that why he should have just sat there and taking it out there in the country people were looking at each other saying would I've just sat there and taking it if they asked us what's happening to me or to my house\nThey are and taking it out there in the country people were looking at each other saying what I've just sat there and taking it up there this was happening to me or my husband or ... or you know my father and the answer is no the uh\nUh uh I think I think the way it was handled did energize the base and a lot of this as you go into these elections is psychological I mean if you get a if you if you it's a last minute and say oh look you know we we voted for these guys last time and it\nDidn't help they weren't able to do it why should I bother that may be going through the minds of some on the Democratic side now plush\nA lot of the a lot of what the Democrats are dependent on it and let's look back at why they did this the one weakness in the in the early polling that a subtle Trump and Republicans had is among educated suburban women\nAnd this whole pour it was an attempt to nail that vote down\nA except that they forgot the fact that these women are fairly independent some of them are Republicans many of them as a matter of fact and they were trying to drag drag drag them over but they're also educated and intelligent and when they looked at this they said\nThis doesn't make any sense at all ah and it looks like exploitation plus a lot of them are mothers and they were thinking\nYou know does this mean that forty years from now my son can just be accused by somebody doesn't even remember with no evidence and have his career and his wife destroyed I think the whole tactics or was not just overreach but it was badly sought out\nA and a and and and has not accomplished what they expected they were going to get out of it and as in fact helped the Republicans\nGets hurt the country it's hurt the ... the Congress has hurt the Senate hurt the image of the Supreme Court but mostly it's hurt the people who did\nWell David Keene really appreciate your calling in especially last minute notice here this morning on the show um yes how how invested do you think the the ... and the Senate race in the I think we're a lengthy areas\nVery invested in the in the race to test race is very important ah and has been as you know and most lives from the very beginning and it's and it's one state I was out there\nWhen the president went to great falls and went to billings uh and it's it's one state in which his popularity can make a real difference and I'm In I'm hopeful ah you know that to this this is one that we're going to be able to with\nWell maybe another ... a quick question for you to is you know we see how bad Jon Tester is right now how how liberal he is\nVoting in support of sanctuary cities voting for anti Second Amendment Supreme Court justice if we see how bad he is now what can we expect if he actually went to survive and get reelected\nWell if he has six years and if the if the if the Democrats think they have a chance to to uh\nTo either win the presidency or get a majority in the Senate or supportive majority in the house or he's going to go along with the leadership if you want to know what John tester is going to be like for the next six years all you have to do is look at the Chuck Schumer of New York because he's going to follow\nChuck Schumer's leads ah that's what he's done that is what he's doing that's what he's going to solve\nRuns the signs are all their David Keene really appreciate your phone call this morning on her to have you on the show\nAnytime thank you All right yeah greatly appreciate always always nice to get a surprise phone call like that here on Montana talks a great great phone call from David Keene hum yea just drop drop to email late last\nNight said hey if you've seen this scene is news from the n._r._a. here but you got it literally you've got a you know the n._r._a. giving Jon Tester now eighty grade and and\nThe response from testers spokesperson as well\nAt a you know the n._r._a. giving Jon Tester now eighty grade it and then the response from tester spokesperson as well\nJon Tester gets guns because he shoots hundreds of cows and hogs making a living shooting hundreds of cows\nAnd hogs anyway is while so but it was kinda funny to see some of the tweets that came back in response I mean you had you had people are sharing old videos from Monty Python up to ... to ... you know\nThe house and or the Senate that's when he can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process uh insulted a and attacked not only a Dr Ford but women who are speaking out\nYou know look I remember Republican operatives shutting down the voting in Florida a into south I remember the swift boating of John Kerry\nI remember the things that even the Republican Party did a to John McCain in two thousand I remember what they did to me\nBob Dylan alive which unfortunately people believe that the Republicans have put a lot of time money and effort and promoting them for when you're dealing with an ideological party that is driven by the left her power\nThat is funded by corporate interests who want a government that doesn't ... ... you can be several but you can't overcome what they intend to do unless you win elections\nIt's like she's living in some alternate universe isn't it she\nDid she ask you you almost think that she actually believes everything she's telling her self there\nAre ... you know the the the corruption coming out of the Clintons they're already back on the speaking to her really that's the reason she's doing this interview with Christie on them and for it's just a promoter book anyway so it all

just been dragging on and on and on and on as Democrats have delayed in the late ... laid it but but now they're trying to say well it was all just rush just like rush that things started back in July but anyway what's your reaction now with the U.S accessible confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nWell first of all is you know I looked into it and believe that a judge Kavanaugh on a justice Kavanaugh was eminently qualified\nI\nLike most Montanans extremely disappointed and the way that a certain people behaved in the United States Senate\nI you know we've just stoop to a new low where you can have people calling\nIn preparation hearings a you know across the people in the hallways and then come to find out we hear Hillary Clinton said that Democrats are not going to be civil unless they win the house or the Senate back\nAnd uh that's not how we do politics in Montana and it shouldn't be or we do politics in Washington DC\nOf course in your role is in front of general you oversee locked in the state and I've got to think that maybe not as much different than them and we saw some sit ins the staged by Democrat socialist in Missoula\nYeah maybe a quick thirty seconds before next

found a you end up you know people forget things that are memory is less clear evidence can disappear\nA lots of things can happen and so we have to be very careful that we um we don't have a system ah that that you know again a charges people wrongfully\nOr doesn't give them full due process of the law to clear their name et cetera so um [noise] you know these are difficult situations obviously and we have statute of limitations for very good reasons and we just want to be very careful that we don't um we don't make a mistake they're\nAll right well we're talking with a Montana as attorney

talk\nAnd attorney general Fox one you're going to be with us attorney general Jim ... is always a pleasure yeah so what was a hundred and forty million dollar settlement with super you ride sharing service over a does a data breach Montana score about what over half a million dollars look what happened there\nWell that's right era and this is a an interesting case um and unfortunately for over a very costly\nCase they learned back in November of two thousand sixteen that hackers had gained access\nTo uh some of the personal information that Hoover maintains on its drivers and um there were over six hundred thousand drivers nationally that were impacted here and rather than\nNotifying the drivers that their personal information may have been compromised and rather than notifying state regulators like the attorney general's office\nAs required by law that there's been a data breach a rubber instead tracked down the hackers and agreed to pay them some money or to destroy the information rather than\nTo release it uh well perhaps that's admirable if you can trust\nA hacker can yeah but\nThe what they should have done is notified us and so it's going to cost them a hundred and forty eight million dollars nationwide and um that share a Montana will receive over five hundred and Seventy five\nThousand dollars so a over a half a million dollars\nBut more importantly a our agreement with Hoover requires them to uh protect us information in the future or they have to\nTake precautions to a to a\nSecure the data that they store with third party platforms are they have to\nDevelop and implement a very strong data security policy have to hire an outside a qualified expert to assess their efforts and uh they have to also uh develop a corporate integrity program to ensure that Hoover employees that can bring\nEthics concerns uh without uh uh being retaliated against [noise] so [noise] excuse me\nI'm important lesson for herbal over to have learned the hard way but in this day and age is you know so many corporations big and small are uh you know\nBeing hacked and so we want to make sure that this doesn't happen in the future\nWell in this crazy that they would have basically paid off the hackers ... now you add a financial incentive to to hackers well they're not going to really be punished but okay here will pay you says\nThanks for for not doing anything with with our information that you still that's crazy and then there was a case involving in Bozeman property management company is well what happened there\nAnd what do other Montana companies can you can what can they learn from this\nWell ah yeah so uh we're learning obviously that these data breaches happened or organizations of big and small and I'm so even our local Montana companies or need to take care of business if you will we learned in mid September\nThat a a ... a company called legacy properties\nI'm a property management company experienced a data breach that affected between nine hundred and twelve a nine hundred in a thousand Montanans um and the hackers in this case actually posted the defected consumers personal information on several a publicly accessible sites\nUm so you know again a Montana businesses need to take care of their consumers 'cause it's\nUh 'cause she's really been one of the most popular figures inside the Trump Administration done a great job\nAs UN ambassador so so what what's going on behind the scenes what's the word on on why she really stepped down all hear about that from Rachel southern and some of

likely already heard the audio of Hillary Clinton saying that you cannot be civil was a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for so Hillary Clinton is basically saying you don't need to be civil a very clear message to her followers that are still out there whoever's left in or at least\nThe the radicals on the left to her you know occupying the streets of Portland\nOr who are occupying the a GOP offices in Missoula and the Democrat socialist movement out there that that that you do not have to be civil and it's basically echoing looked Maxine Waters was saying when when Maxine Waters to just get in their faces\nA ... do they show up at a restaurant wherever just get in their faces of the I mean that's basically what Hillary Clinton is that going here but the other a soundbite let's get on a lot of play from her interview with Christie on I'm a poor on CNN last night\nUh when she was asked this question about sexual assault allegation so one has thrown against conservatives but hey what about allegations that we're arrogant that were thrown out there against your husband\nDon't have to be incredibly strong first to get elected than to get reelected and to survive and it was not a\nEasy by any means obviously a but he really believes that Democrats have to be tougher and have to stand up to the bowling and the intimidation on\nSo I think still have things to say about his own experience and how it applies here I Will certainly have a lot to say about what's going on in the world today based on not only my secretary of state yours but my travel\nAnd might look what happened which came out in paperback which has an afterword where I talk about these threats to democracy\nI don't want to be serious because I think a lot of people will be coming to the U.S to show their support to be part of a a gathering of like minded folks but I Do want to leave some thought that I tried to do in the speech today about what each of them can do\nYou say the other talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the un through all these neat you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight the impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband had to answer those questions he ... them and\nHow do you see that senator or just\nPresident against your own husband for bed also those questions he ... them and how do you see that some of the different from what President Trump is being accused of and have it on others today\nWell there's a very significant difference and that is the intense long lasting part of an investigation that was conducted in the night\nIf um you know the Republicans are already with President Trump on down a want a comparison nation welcome such investments in them so\nYou know Hillary Clinton that was different there's a difference yeah I think the difference is called corroborating evidence uh but anyway a Hillary Clinton back on this speaking circuit their art ... here with Montana talk so what about the resignation\nOf Nikki Haley as UN ambassador she's really one of the most popular been one of the most popular officials inside the Trump Administration very strong leader at the helm or as President Trump's UN ambassador on the phone lines with us now Fox News Radio's Rachel Sutherland Rachel what are you hearing back in Washington great to have you on the show\nOh thanks for having me yeah it was a surprise to the press corps but apparently not to those inside the administration which is surprising in itself in a city that leak so much fat Nikki Haley will be gone as US ambassador to the un by the end of the year\nOr the president said that she had told him about six months ago that she would be a ready to to take a break and they leave on good terms that she's leaving on her own terms it appears\nAt the present this thing that he wishes she wouldn't go but he understands that she could come back and have a job pretty much what she wants she made it clear that she doesn't have any real plans going forward and she's not going to run and twenty twenty as in for president but a lot there's been speculation about Nikki Haley teacher she's been popular she mentioned as\nA un secretary UN ambassador but also as the the first woman governor of South Carolina and I just don't think we've seen the last of Nikki Haley\nYeah I mean she is a rock star mentioned now she's one of those popular figures inside the administration [noise]\nAh I mean she has shown a position of strength or on the world stage that I think Americans have been ... for for many years now so I Do think there's more to her resignation as they're more of a story there or is a ... ton of those jobs can really be grueling on people and you do a couple of years and then you pop smoke\nWell people are looking for something more I think in her ... a decision to leave by the end of the year\nAnd especially the announcement ahead of the mentors people are questioning that\nBut she is just said that really that government services are limited thing she believes in term limits\nShe believes in unlimited service and she uh during her time as governor of South Carolina she she dealt with a lot of challenging situations one of them being that terrible church shooting a hurricane she'd had a tumultuous past several years\nOr it may be that she really wants to take a break 'cause that something comes out later that the\nThat shed some data on that but really it it it appears that if we take her at her word she she just has put in two years in this job and is ready to do something else for a while\nUh but again I kinda think that we're going to see her again whether it's in a political capacity on the local level or on a on a larger scale than that I just I just think she's got a really bright future ahead of her\n... and what's the speculation for her replacement right now I Know there's a few different names for me bonkers Trump all the way to the German ambassador being thrown out there\nYeah that's right actually the president went ahead and that's the idea of his daughter Ivanka doing the job he he said that he thought she'd be incredible at it but that he'd be accused of nepotism or one person that's on the parts\nIt's a Goldman Sachs executive who is also was\nFormer deputy national security adviser for President Trump um another one that's being bandied about is you mentioned a current US ambassador to Germany recur now but the president said he kind of like ... where he is not as\nThe president said that about two or three weeks and he'll make a decision on a replacement as a person will have to go through a confirmation process but let's just hope it's not as crazy\nAs time went through for Supreme Court or you're breathing a sigh of relief on Capitol Hill as as everybody just or they just ... is a kind of like the week after the super bowl or everybody just kind of okay we had our big blow out\nWe ... we watch the game either your team won or your team lost them and everybody just kind of settles down for the next week is that what it feels like in Washington right now well\nIt it did on Monday and then that is the Haley resigning yesterday that they are\nAll ... all at once and um you know every day is different here in DC but uh it was it was it three weeks of high drama and it's every day around the clock coverage of this cabinet story\nAnd I think that among lawmakers and the press corps and maybe every American there's a bit of a relief ever although I I've been monitoring a a\nHomeland security hearing it on on threat the Senate Homeland Security Committee and there were protesters there this

rise\nA largely because a lot of the drug problem that's that's been on on the rise here in the past few years not just in buildings but really across the state\nAnd so ... and they're they're volunteers\nAs they're they're really the folks who are walking alongside these these kids who are having to deal with these problems I'm In and these ... in his problems in their families and then having to go through struggled through the court system and all of that so Kari ... who is now on that\nFamilies and then having to go through struggle through the court system and all that so Kari ... who is now on the cover of the latest edition of the ... valley woman magazine not only does she work as a social worker in the emergency room but she also a is a volunteer for casa\nI'm Terry what can you tell us about costs about what it's like to work with these kids who have to struggle through the court system how important programs like costs are\nSo right now there's I Know for sure there's over eight hundred and fifty children in foster care in Yellowstone county alone\nAnd a ... is their true voice so we so we go directly to the judge our report we act report directly to the judge and we are the voice of the children of my first case I started to become a cost the last year at the beginning of the year so I'm into my second year\nThe end of my second year and my first case I'm within four days I had to go to court\nTo talk to the judge about what the children wanted\n'em and then in my process um the children were each moved three times so as these children are moved from foster home to foster home from school to school whatever I Am there one true constant\nAnd I am their voice children's voices get lost within this ... a legal system and it's really important that the that the children have a voice as well I work very closely what the um foster parents and my first case I had three children um the beginning of last year\nAnd I wasn't sure that this mom could um get her act together\nAnd um you can try but they have to change for themselves and so a costs are typically works with the children but we can also work with the family and um I just wasn't sure this mom was going to do it but as a court appointed special advocates\nThat it's the goal is to reunite with the family we go and tell and untold child protective services deems that it's not a safe environment and then they'll\nUm terminating parental rights and so I have to tell you my first case was a huge success mom ended up realizing that she needed to change or she wasn't going to get her three kids back\nAnd within a year and a half um actually two weeks ago the case was closed mom was reunited with all three kids and I am so very proud of her for working so very hard to get her children back um and I in the end was her biggest advocate as well\nUm because she deserved it she had jumped every who had done everything she needed to do um and I know that um they can that family is and the healing process and can move forward\nOr there's some days where you just want to quit or your are your lead singer so why did I get myself into this\nUm you know um what so my second case I'm working on now has four children and the mom um doesn't really care for me um and I think she doesn't care for anybody that isn't being manipulated by her\nAnd so she actually went into casa and there hasn't been very many um biological parents that going to cost that into the costs of office and demand for that causes it to be removed\nAnd I thought that must happen a lot right no [laughter]\nSo she's not um and so you know there's a part where you know is she going to hurt me you know is she going to be aggressive with me you know how how how does that play out\nAnd what I've decided is is that if I Can't stand up to these parents how can these children stand up to these parents so no matter how bad the situation as no matter how stressful it can be um I have to stand strong for the children so they're not put back somewhere where it's not safe and then I\n[noise]\nEnjoying the show anytime my calling the room rocks cabinet company fall in line at four O. six to nine four zero nine Seventy says Montana talks on GB well am nine Seventy and news talk Ninety five point five\nErrands here with Montana talks coming up in the nine o'clock hour of the shows we take a statewide from Glen dive to Kalispell\nWhere it's going to the phone lines open anything and everything you want to talk about here on the show so it's always a very fast moving out to see the entire morning just flies by here but\nBut definitely when we go state wide uh it'll it's just gonna fly by so you always tried to front load your phone calls ... ... you folks listening here to Ninety five five and nine Seventy ... you kind of get the advance lead time here you get to know the phone number ahead of time\nSo ah so you can always kinda stack the deck and call it had early but a ... student for zero nine Seventy the phone number\nIf you ever want to jump in and the conversation ... can open up the phone last year and a few minutes to anything and everything you want to talk about so the big news and commentary pieces of the day will jump back into that but the first thing they want to go back to our guests here in Studio with us here is the latest edition of Yellowstone belly woman magazine\nIs now out the on newsstands across the city of buildings across the county here\nUm we're talking with Cary written the who is on the cover of the Yellowstone belly woman magazine she's in an E R social worker and also a volunteer for a great organization costs of the court appointed special advocates I'm helping kids who are\nA system and all of that she's there walking alongside these these kids and we've also got Julie Gerber who heads up the Yellowstone valley woman magazine with us ah we were talking about this during the break um carry you made a great point about doing all these random acts of kindness and\nAnd so I if you could recap kind of what you said about how um it's not just about helping other people\nSure so you know I'm volunteering and volunteering your time and doing a good deed as people kind of perceive it as me helping somebody else or us helping somebody else but really in the same breath it helps you as a person\nTo take the time for me to help somebody and need\nThat could maybe not figure out a system that I can figure out\nUm it's not only helping them and helping better their quality of life but it's also helping me as a person it's filling my soul cup is how I see it and even my family um they don't understand why I work like probably fifty to sixty hours a week and then I still find time to volunteer\nAnd so it's really important to me to fill my soul cup every single day\nAnd helping others not only helps them but helps you and I really think that it is a um it kind of comes back to you\nYou know I'm as you become a better person good things come to you as well and so it's really important to me to fill my soul cup and volunteering my time to help others in need um the story with the twenty most inspiring women\nI'm penny running set at best and I didn't even realize it until I read it\nThat I Am drawn to the most vulnerable population I did not realize that and I had an a ha moment when I read what penny wrote about me\nAnd everybody's going to be different um like my passion is elderly and the most vulnerable population and maybe airing your is yours is animals and maybe Julie yours is children if we all just focus on that one part of us that's going to fail our soul cup\nAnd we all do that one area can you imagine how different are community let alone our world be\nYeah yeah well and there's more great stories that we didn't even get to yet I'm too but you can read all about it in the latest edition of the oldest in valley woman magazine so Kerry we really appreciate you coming into studio is always fun thank you get to meet the folks behind the story here Julie ... river\nUm talk in one of the things I like to do the show to especially as a chat with\nYou know kind of leaders out there in the community like you and others as hey what else are we not hearing what what are the other stories that maybe aren't getting a lot of attention or what something that people haven't heard about really yet um you've got a few of those in in this latest addition out there too\nYeah we do actually um one story that really really touched my heart in this issue is that of I'm Carolyn Jim Keenan um their daughter died a couple of years ago from an opioid overdose it was an accidental opioid overdose um because she actually\nYou know when we when we got into the story we discovered that the pill that actually ultimately killed her wasn't opioid at all it was a counterfeit opioid pill that was actually set now um and I don't know if you've been following it you know legislation that's been going\nThrough ... allowing a when attorney general Jeff Sessions was here at the ... foundation alongside the U.S attorney colonel mean others um as you as a talk with state local and federal law enforcement all the way up to the attorney general not only from Montana but also for the U.S and yeah and those been you know front line issue as well\nAnd and what was so alarming to me was the fact that when they ...\nNot only from Montana but also for the U.S and yeah ... you know frontline issue as well\nAnd and what was so alarming to me was the fact that when they rated this home\nThat I'm with the home where the pills came from that ultimately killed Mary Kate um it was a mail order China operation so they weren't getting through the U.S postal service setting all\nDelivered from China to this home in Colorado where they were then making it look in stamping it with the the stamp that made it look like an opioid pills\nUm more ... Coto and I guess it was so I'm Carolyn Jim we're kind of these parents that were just going about life they noticed a change in their daughter um knew it was drugs tried to get her into treatment she did get into treatment for about Eighteen months before she fell back\nI'm ... and and had this relapse but what was interesting was they wrote this really passionate obituary and Asia Gore I'm Katie be accused former reporter Asia Gore Saudi obituary and out of the book called them thinking that there was a deeper story there\nUm that deeper story prompted a whole bunch of chatter in the community and before they knew what they were asked to speak on panels as parents of someone who died from an opioid overdose overdose\nI'm doing this to wait you know Carolyn Jim Will tell you I don't know if we would have been propelled\nInto that kind of um position in the community or you know thrown out and so that that arena had it not been for Asia and when I talked\nTo a loud and I was a great reporter I Know he wasn't afraid of the practice or hurt yeah and\nYou know something that I didn't even mentioned in the story as she became so close to the family and I don't know if you know it but Asian Asia is an artist or didn't do that and I'm so Carol sitting at her home one day and here's this kinda knock on the door or kind of like at the door opening and she goes in Asia at the front door with this package in her hand\nAnd she said I just wanted to leave this for you I didn't I wanted to surprise you and I I didn't want to bother you\nI'm Carol opens up the package and it is a sketch that Asia drew of Mary Kate oh well I'm a I mean isn't\nThat just brings tears tries but it just goes to show there's heartstrings around every single story and that's one of the great things to you know I'm ... a lot of the discussion\nAbout the media the media the media but there are you know when you have reporters it's oftentimes good to separate\nNews reporting from editorial reporting but also even there is some reporters that do these incredible feature stories and and and feature stories just like this\nAnd you really develop a relationship with these people you almost it's almost like you feel like you're part of the family like I I remember doing a a a a story actually back when I was working for for Kate DBQ\nWith a woman who who ah she she basically a sheet anyway basically her her ... her first husband\nWas killed in Vietnam and and long story short they ended up finding his remains they located him but she never got the word so the government massively dropped the ball here\nBecause that's you know it was incredibly important for her to have some sense of closure there because she was just you know Eighteen Nineteen years old but anyway I still see her on Facebook and in love sooner updates and everything like that but\nThere's another story in here you've got a with a this is with a retired army lieutenant colonel ... and I've I've chatted with at on the radio has been a number of years now but I'll have to circle back around with him but\nYou were saying apparently she's got a book out here that the headline the headline for this pieces leave no woman behind right retired lieutenant colonel fights to preserve the memory of Montana's World War one service women so I'm looking forward to reading the space yeah what is the story here\nWell I you know I did not right\nBut the story but um that's got a new book out called map second relative is um and it basically is kind of bring to the forefront those forgotten women\nUm I you know he was just out I'm putting flags on the grave sites of that trends kind of just to show honor and stumbled across Florence aims um headstone and she was I'm a woman with an amazing past\nUm you know like the army I now I\nNow you're going to put me on a ... or yeah thank God I'm like I'm going to get that Ron right in front of you here yeah yeah\nBut I mean this man and his mission to make sure that these women get honored and recognize its tire less and you know he was one of the the folks that was key in getting that cemetery outlaw rural town or ... and so I just think it's it's amazing when\nYou step into his space and you see almost like an Energizer Bunny effect for that for that costs just [noise] um\nTo take your great ideas for your home over to Ron Ron cabinet company

shortly if if I don't I'm not sure Travis Lee our producer out of foresight Montana\nWill come over here and smacked me on the back of the hey tell them the news okay so we'll get to that but I Want to jump right into the phone calls here before we do anything else let's go to Eric I'm On line three Eric good to hear from you what's on your mind this morning\nMorning I just wanted to say real quick my wife and I went to the president's last night that the ... they were that was a fun show really enjoyed it my question is sometimes you're just kind of hard to make an informed decision judges are hot topic now we're going to get some legit information you know you see the commercials you see the signs\nBut you get into the polling booth and you think wow I really do anything I just don't want to get the next on oil on the bench or something work at a\nGuy get some information good good good question good point yeah so one thing that I Would recommend to folks and and this is helpful for whether you're liberal conservative or could care less um and so the Montana Family Foundation\nI'm actually on their Web site what they did is they follow the money because with judge candidates it's hard to find out okay where do they really stand you know um but one way that you can find out\nIs is you can see how they have donated politically so do they give all their money to Republicans do they give all their money to Democrats [noise] um and and so yeah Montana Family Foundation you might say well that's a conservative organization so they're going to back a conservative candidates yeah typically of course they will but\nBut what they compiled is just just the facts just the information that says hey here's\nWho this judge candidate voted for or or gave money to\n'em and and they'll show you percentage wise this person gave all their money to Democrats this person gave all their money to Republicans so I think that is probably the only the\nBest advice I could give right now to anybody looking to how to vote for these judge candidates because otherwise you you just don't know what their philosophy is because they're so tight lipped about it in and they're all these generic nonpartisan races\nAll bars and all we know full well that's the case I Will I appreciate the information\nAll right well I appreciate your phone call yeah you know what I have yet thanks recall air good to hear from you\nYeah you know another option too is you know if you're a member of of any of these organizations so like let's say for example if a you know if you're a pro life voter for example you go to either to the Montana Family Foundation or ... you know pro abortion or you know a little more more on the left\nThey go to go to Planned Parenthood they'll probably tell you which judges they're backing right\nUm or or maybe if if you disagree with Planned Parenthood you might even just called hey who are you guys back in for judge and\nNot one but even if you're like OK say if you're a member of a Farm Bureau stock growers\nYou know any of these so you know the Montana chamber of commerce sometimes you gotta be careful with the the individual the local chambers of commerce 'cause sometimes they can get hijacked politically but but anyway to reach out to some of those organizations and they may not be able to tell you on the record but they might be able to give you the wink and a nod to say hey if well this is who work\nWe're looking forward to seeing in that position there\nAre some lines are open for you know six to nine four zero nine Seventy will get Clarence in Columbia falls on the phone line Clarence what's on your ...\nOr ... I just mentioned judge there and I could be wrong as I understand or\nA judge Miller got Max Baucus for some time as a party does make a different guy that's understand it that a Mac a picture in my lower back and there are a lecture or show\nImportant Internet and Colombia falls regret to debate going between jury or Neal Sean Wyoming and Zach Perry show a folk singer planted here why here what are our dates that are running for the legislature\nWhat their viewpoint it'd be a good night feminine o'clock to Rome and Colombia fall\nYeah uh what are the big issues there in Libya falls that you think people will be talking to their local legislative candidates about you know that that may differ may or may be similar to what what what people are picking their candidates on elsewhere across the state\nWell you know there there's a lot of people are just spoke party line here is why they hold over the water contractor still fresh in people's minds and kind of a bad or good taste and and the wider you're paying money to take for water right from the first place\nSo a lot of issues that are\nAre the log your niche you a ... a larger resource or go out and burn it or burn power she managed drier that gets out of control and burned out\nThere it's just it's it's so important to vote because of the people that are that are being laid\nYeah [noise] and ... in in on the judges of course the ... you're exactly right judge ... federal judge a who's kind of credited with basically being a blank check on the bench\nFor the environmental movement and shutting down so many uh good jobs and industries in northwest Montana because he was a blank check for the environmental movement\nBut yeah he was because he's a federal judge he was appointed to that seat by a Max Baucus simply push the nomination and was when Bill Clinton at the time\nI'm so is right you how you vote for United States senators\nAnd decides who those judges are going to be so windy so when you now have like the judge in great falls Brian Morris making rulings against the Keystone excel pipeline potentially making rulings against coal development in in South central and south eastern Montana but who do you think put him there\nBrock Obama and John tester so that the elections matter when it comes to those judges and has an immediate link 'em but going back to Eric ... of course of course the point error was making was was talking about the judge's at the at the county level and the district judges that we will be voting on here or absentee ballots coming out a friday so\nThe new things\nI ... bridge due to Montana loses Montana talks with their influence you know it wasn't a cow el ... was shooting it was just shooting cows that like all ... you get a note from a from Jake balances I like guns\nHad a hunting license and decades but I'd shot cows just comical\nYeah yeah yeah you should read or eight years of the n._r._a. downgraded Senator Jon Tester's a rating from the national Rifle Association to eight D I mean for a United States senator from Montana do get a deep from the n._r._a.\nOr that's that's bad folks are but his his response from his campaign spokesperson as well\nHe shoots cows he shots ... shot hundreds of cows are\nAll right good for you buddy I don't know what that has to do with the second amendment\nIt is not referring to ... the only time he ever has had a hunting license was thinking that\nThe twenty twelve election cycle because he had to tell people who bought a hunting license or whatever but anyway\nUh talk about that much more here on Montana talks will get a lot of phone calls about civility here a so civility\nUm and so just to recap this is what Hillary Clinton had to say about civility last night on CNN with Christiana ... I don't know about you but to me this is that well I'm not gonna play unless\nI get to be in charge you\nCannot be liberal with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and toward that\nThere there was another soundbite that she also is making some news on so Christiana poor asked her\nHey okay well you and your husband your back on the speaking tour you know you get your book it's you're pedaling all that this is my re phrasing of Christian on the question of course but but then but then I mean I'm a poor or asked her this\nUm the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband from head to answer those questions he ... them and how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and ... and others today\nWell there's a very significant difference\nAnd that is the intense\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted\nIn the night if um\nYou know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down a one or a comparison nation welcome such an investigation themselves\nAre so busy Hillary Clinton's basically saying okay well you're you're jumping in on these this discussion about the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh justice Kevin on now\nIn and allegations against President Trump but what about these accusations from your hunt a husband and she's basically wow there's there's a big difference here [laughter] so now this is not me saying this list is the reaction from our our great producer Travis Lee he says\nWell here's my two cents worth a no Hillary or the difference between the two investigations is a stained blue dress Travis his words not mine I did not stay to\nVote you know the way to put it at corroborating evidence that might be another a big difference here between the two as well but anyway let's jump into the phone was let's see who we get patiently waiting here I Know it's somebody out of Kalispell bill in Kalispell patiently waiting billionaire\nYes I Am All right good to hear from you\nHey good to hear from you and I wanted to thank you for your service to our country I appreciated\nWell thanks and we got a lot of great great listeners who have done a heck of a lot more than I've done so appreciated\n[laughter] hey I got a very serious question er and um I don't know if it's been asked or people even thought about it you hear about all this unrest and their lives and dams or taking a violence and be hurting and stuff like that when we\nWe just adopted or two grandchildren\nThat Iran daughter's seven and rain watching the news which\nI let her watch and she's seen all this fighting going on and pictures and stuff and she goes up a um [noise] are we going to have a war here\nAnd you know I got there really thinking about it I mean you've got extremists on both sides oh it's going to take my opinion is\nPeople to get out there and start shooting at one another which is possible\nWhen when you own which is already happening in some instances right and you look at what I Do congressmen us deeds to lease and what happened to actually if there wasn't a good guy with a gun there to stop the bad guy with a gun they're more would have died yeah\nRight and like I'm saying I mean people aren't thinking about our children I mean there's seeing this I mean I'm fifty years old I've been through a lot but I mean\nI I'm a strict conservative and like I said I mean I hear these things like the thing that I'm scared for my grand kids I mean I Am scared for the future I mean I Am and then I hear these ads by tester running and they were talking about having a drinking\nWell test or sitting in a commercial drinking at a brewery\nI mean you can identify with with he's just he's got to look like the regular Montana and you can't let people think that he's you know that he's the top receipts\nYou can identify with with he's just he's got to look like the regular Montana and you can't let people think that he's you know that he's the top recipient a lobbyist cash and he bought the big house in DC so he's got to show a picture and drinking a beer yeah right\nI just got one quick question I'll let you go yeah like I said I Want people to start thinking about the future of our grandkids and all the violence I mean I don't understand I mean from democratic friends\nAnd they're really down or the old ... and\nUm this country is falling apart I mean I support Trump one hundred percent I support Republicans and conservatives one hundred percent but I just want people to Montana to start thinking we could watch the news and children watch this and it isn't good\nIn their home and I wonder if there had already done yeah they're having these conversations in their schools as well well thank you thank you bill appreciate your phone call things for ... yeah um I I'll have to see where I saw this story at I feel like it was maybe a CNN eggs or or something like that but\nThe but exactly what you're talking about ... ... they are literally having the discussion on in mainstream news outlets that\nThat that uh you know do some of these left wing activist basically want to cause a civil war in this in this country as a result of all of this ah where is the story but but but the the the term that has been\nUsed so far is that we're in a ... that kind of like the Cold War we're in a cold civil war where where\nIt's just you know the two sides aren't talking together and things are tense and there's hostilities here and here are kind of on the hinterlands but there's no major outweigh\nOutright war right so this is a cold civil war\nUm but I but there's people that are obviously very very afraid of it because because it goes back to exactly what Hillary Clinton what Hillary Clinton said right there is so wrong on so many fronts it's kind of like those of us who we didn't support Morocco Obama getting elected president in two thousand eight\nBut but you have a peaceful transition of power he is still the president you know like I got shipped off to Afghanistan ah actually I was I think one that I get there I got it okay he got elected while I was in Afghanistan he got sworn in while I was in Afghanistan\nI I couldn't just say well I'm just going to set the rifle down here now you know what I'm not going out on patrol the day because\nHe's not my president not my president that you hear from these resist jak wagons is serving in our government getting our taxpayer dollars that are actively undermining a democratically elected president hey what do you agree with him or not just like ... when Obama was president didn't have to agree with his policies or not\nBut but at the end of the day hey you're serving your country and if that's who they elected president then you serve that President when you're serving in uniform or you're when you're serving in a government agency [noise]\nUm but but Hillary Clinton is saying there well we can go to that when we when when we when we'll have severely when we when we'll work together\nYou that and that's how it all that that's how the media is constantly biased on this topic because they will celebrate Republicans who cross the law this was a good sign of [noise] of Republicans and Democrats working together [laughter]\nBut if it's on but if a Democrat crosses al ... Joe mansion if a Democrat crosses the aisle they will demonize\nA Democrat or that little push 'em at a party I mean Joe Lieberman had to get pushed out of the Democratic or maybe he was glad to leave any way given the anti Israel antics coming out of out of that side of the party are a mixed up on the phone lines we've got Brad ... in Laurel Brad good to hear from you\nKnow first I Want to clarify Charlotte her marriage thing\nMark in Laurel Brad did you hear me\nWell first I Want to clarify that I have Charlotte Carl harvesting nobody's ever called me still wear my of course\n[laughter] well I don't know if that helps your election chances down the road or hurt somebody either way\nI'm going to have to pay thirty five dollar a pilot right yeah\nWhat I wanted to chime about or that the whole ... thing was\nStrictly about do we put\nA strict construction of on the court or do we wait to hear from two weeks and get somebody that thinks the constitution as a living breathing document yeah and yeah ... ... yesterday endorsed Jewish ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "city": "Billings", "day": "10"}
