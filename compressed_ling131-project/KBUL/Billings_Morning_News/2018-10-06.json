organizing a big holiday dinner\nShe couldn't get the guest list right and she would forget names and she would cross them out she wanted to get a count with are going to be twenty Twenty one twenty two and she kept asking me to help her with the guest list but she wasn't used to asking for help so she got very frustrated and the little teary\nAnd then what happened was she would rip up the paper and started gap\nThat was unusual for her mother ... a professor of writing at the new school in New York figured it was simply part of natural aging she wasn't too worried after all her mother was still driving and even golfing regularly but then the other things started going wrong\nShe did start hallucinating she had the sculptures and her living room and she thought the sculptures for moving

one\nDoctors had little to say about Silvio condition and what they did say wasn't very helpful\nShe lives misdiagnosed you know in the beginning it was well what do you expect to your age doctors would say to her not the doctors that we returned to necessarily and then something doctors would say it with a normal aging process and most doctors will be fought old she was misdiagnosed with\nIllnesses no one ever diagnosed her with Alzheimer's because she didn't have an official diagnosis until about a year or two before she died she was put on a lot of medications that can be harmful\nShowman figures that for about eight of the ten years before her mother's death she was misdiagnosed she clearly had dementia with hallucinations and jerky involuntary body movements that are not characteristic ...\nOne of the things that started happening was she started losing her balance before the jerky movements and she would fall and she would lose her balance and actually in the last two years of her life she did get up and fall and break her hip and she was never able to walk again\nAnd the balance issue looks a little like Parkinson's and that's why it's so hard to diagnose so towards the end of her life she would have these jerky motions with her hands\nAnd sometimes we'd have to put mittens on our hands so she wouldn't scratch herself\nThat the part I didn't know how to help her with the balance the jerking movements that were so upsetting so she was being treated for the ... nations as those who were ... which he wasn't there isn't a lot you can do mainly you need to keep\nOur loved ones safe\nFrom falling but you can always watch some on\n... done a lot of research into those symptoms in conjunction with the book she's writing titled raising my mother since ... death in two thousand nine showman has concluded that her mother suffered from the second most common form of dementia suffered by about one point four million Americans or twenty percent of people with dementia\nIt's called Louie body dementia spelled L E W why after the pathologist who discovered the triggering changes in the brain\nHowever Louis buddy dementia is really an umbrella term for two disorders\nOne is actually Parkinson's disease to match up so to mention that occurs in the context of somebody who already has classic Parkinson's disease with the motor symptoms that you typically see with that such as the tremor the slowness of movement stiffness the muscles\nThat stuck or James ... director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou ... Center for brain health and chair of the scientific advisory council for the Louis buddy dementia association\n... other disorder underneath that relatives dementia with Louis bodies and these individuals'\nUnlike the Parkinson's disease to match patients present with a cognitive thinking problem they may later developed motor symptoms of Parkinson's or some of the other non motor complications of Parkinson's but the big differences they present with a cognitive impairment versus a voter\nComedian Robin Williams was known to be depressed before his suicide in twenty fourteen but since then blame it has been centered on Louis body dementia Williams widow says he was being treated for early Parkinson's disease and an autopsy confirmed the presence of Louis bodies in his brain\nLouis bodies are a change we see in the brain it's actually in the brain\nAnd an autopsy confirmed their presence of Louis bodies in his brain\nLouis bodies are a change we see in the brain it's actually in the brain cells that are aggregation of protein that's called alpha ... and we see Louis bodies both in\nParkinson's disease Parkinson's disease with dementia and dementia with Louis bodies that's why we kind of put them under that umbrella term of Louis body dementia and Alzheimer's disease there are different proteins that aggregate in their brain amyloid or something called how are you\nSo the protein that aggregates Louis by is a different protein but it's very similar in that way\nTends to occur in different parts of the brain say an old timers versus the Louis body disorders which explains why we see different kinds of symptoms in these disorders\nHowever those differences are often overlooked or may seem to doctors to be completely unconnected to what's mainly a ton of problem ... says as a result Louis body dementia is often misdiagnosed reportedly the average patient spends a year and a half looking for a diagnosis visiting it leads to three doctors along the way\nWe see dementia with Louis bodies often diagnosed the Alzheimer disease and that's partly no fault necessarily of the doctors who are trying to make that diagnosis sometimes it just looks\nA pure thinking problem cognitive impairment problem\nAnd therefore they don't see some of these characteristics such as elusive nation seen things that aren't real\nSomething called REM sleep disorder where people act their dreams out at night\nWe don't see an old timers unless they have coexistence so half of all timers and Louis body changes a bright little bit easier when it occurs in the context of Parkinson's disease because these people generally clearly already have a motor disorder\nAnd they're responding to therapy we know they have Parkinson's disease in that context about eighty percent of patients if they live long enough will develop dementia\nLeBron says the cognitive deficits Louis body dementia may not be as severe as ... but the additional symptoms can be extremely serious hallucinations are extremely common they occur in about Seventy percent of patients\nThey're often very vivid visual people will see children playing in their front yard or animals in the house and they can be very vivid and very real looking\nThey are not always disturbing and because the medications for treating them can have some significant side effects if they're not disturbing we often don't treat them\nInvolve various mechanisms to change the structure of DNA the code of the genome I liken this to saying the human genome genome that builds you and me has three billion letters\nThey come in just four out of its ACT dingy and you could imagine the human genome as an enormous encyclopedia and if it was actually written as an encyclopedia it would be sixty six foot sets up the Encyclopedia Britannica chicken imagine walking into a room and finding in every war one of these volumes of things that could be the Metallica\nBut most importantly in the last five or ten years scientists have begun to gather technologies that allow us to go into that code that master code of instructions pick out one volume of the encyclopedia pick out one word and then secondly to erase it and change it\nScientists can do this in the test you for a few genes now but it's extremely new technology and while gene editing could someday be an incredible way to eradicate genetic diseases we don't know the cost\nWe don't know what the side effects are but the capacity to change the human genome and this way is obviously a great significance\nBecause potentially could change the way we're exposed to breast cancer if you had to be back one mutation rapid imitation all of this is being evaluated now but my book is just to remind our says the precipice that were on and that we really should be careful about moving forward as the answer some of the fundamental questions of what all of this means\nFirst of all ... suggested we should figure out the ultimate purpose of the use of these technologies\nBeing a doctor I think that the first kind of standard is that we should be really using this if at all to ameliorate extraordinary suffering and that they should not be used casually there's no casual role for using or intervening on the human genome\nThe ultimate goal is to eliminate extorting suffering number two I think it's important to realize that we should only do these kinds of events or the interventions\nWhen we understand to a large extent what the genes do in other words there should be a good correspondence between the gene and the disease or not trying to intervene on things that affect diseases ten percent of the time or have a large role of chance in them\nAnd the third and probably most important piece of this is that all of this has to be done with freedom and with choice and with a big public conversation around it so by freedom of choice I mean that they cannot be a state mandate to change someone's genome water forcibly look at your child genome before you decide to do anything about it\nHowever some of challenge the ethics\nWorry that scientists have indeed gotten to the point where they can play God but ... doesn't believe it's unethical to research how to edit the human genome at least on cells in the lab beyond that though it gets ...\nThe main ethical boundary is if you have the possibility of doing this in a human embryo or even potentially something that can become a human embryo in the future\nThat where the kids that are more stringent because we do not want to change the human gene pool in a way that might have unintended consequences or side effect that we have not understood yet so it's very strictly barricaded but it's really barricaded right now particularly human embryos I should emphasize and it's important\nThat this kid may not apply to all countries so in China for instance even attempt to take non viable human embryos important in non viable in the long run but nonetheless human embryos and an attempt was made to try to edit the genes of human embryos and that unleashed a kind of factor of worry across the world\nAnd the realization that we might be able to potentially intervene a human embryos in a way that we hadn't been able to before\n... says we've been down the dangerous road have genetic manipulation before it was in vogue and the early Nineteen hundreds when it was called eugenics and Nazi Germany instead as an excuse for extermination of an entire race\nLook Archie says it's a reminder that we can never be too cautious [noise]\nOur

who are publicly traded companies that's worked very well for us for about the first hundred and thirty five years and then it didn't work as well for us during the last ten or Fifteen Years that we are in the air this and that\nPlan essentially we went from for four hundred to ...\nAnd about ten or twelve years\nAnd that's really what the story is about what it was like growing up in the family during that major to climate and the emotional fallout and family and what was going on within the family dynamics the collapse really of the family Detroit and the business all and hair allow\nThe book strollers referencing it's her a story all debut called beer money a memoir of privilege and loss to understand her story you must first entered\nAnd that she comes from my great great grandfather Bernard stroke came over from Germany and Eighteen forty eight with a family recipe at a hundred and fifty dollars as pocket and the family recipe was a beer recipe that his family had been brewing up there in\nAdjacent to which was a small worry that they ran in Germany so Bernard came over and learned how to brew beer and Pennsylvania for two years and then he settled in Detroit\nAnd started a brewery there because the local water tasted so good and the great lakes\nAnd he built his life in Detroit started brewing beer initially in his basement delivering a door to door out of a wheelbarrow saving every spare penny to buy a horse drawn carriage\nAnd his sons Bernard junior and Julius continued to run the company is continued to be very successful and it grew exponentially during the early part of the twentieth century\nAs the decades past the brewery was passed through the generations stroke says during prohibition they survived by making ice cream in World War two her grandfather refused to water his beard down despite the financial Costa refusing to do so\nAnd eventually the company fell into the hands of her uncle's and father whether they wanted it or not\nThere were members of the fourth generation I think my uncle Peter included\nWho really didn't want to work for the family business Peter wanted to work for the CIA he was hit by a truck while he was in CIA training and limbs for the rest of his life and was not able to work for the CIA so he style back on the family business\nAnd it just really was that where he wanted to be and the same is true for my father who's a very talented photographer you wanted to pursue that as a career he was discouraged by his family from doing that and joined the business sort of grudgingly\nHe was under the control of this generation that some poor decisions were made and that companies demise was set\nThe company grew exponentially and really had explosive growth all through the fifties sixties and into the late seventies when my uncle Peter strode took over and decided\nThat rather than growing incrementally the way we had been doing it he want it to grow through acquisition\nAnd get very big very quickly so his first acquisition was shaved forever and Pennsylvania which brought us into the northeast and then one year later our company which was a hundred million market cap at that time\nTook out a half a billion dollar loan to buy the ... gray and suddenly we were the big national brewer with ... all over the country and thirty five and brands when we'd only had a few brands\nPrior to that this was a very big and bold moves that essentially men\nPeter was betting the farm\nAnd it was very risky we didn't have the marketing budget to market all these new brands we had along with our own brands and we're competing against publicly traded companies at this point and we just got too big to quickly\nBut growing up strobe didn't know just how big the company was how big it would get or what it would mean for her life\nAs a child I was obviously aware that we had this company that was recognized in our community at that time in the late sixties and seventies we were really made a western ...\nIt was before we had gone national but of course the same way that and how they're Bush you know and by the wiser was a huge name in St Louis that's

smart guy no it was used to have all kinds of just ask questions well that that brings me up to this\nTrees in the summertime trees minimize solar heat gang yeah in our homes because of the shade decree we all know the benefits of\nStanding under the tree on a hot dog is day two laws is not lightening the another good point by really on did they ask me so much you're really on the day\nI'm you've had and you had a show on about a favorite tree\nAnd it forward for you you just want it and I want something you know realistically you know and and the amazing though how fast treated or outside as time goes around it does a a robust but looking at a tree but if you want a fast growing tree lot of times they are in a very good tree to use All right so there's often would then Kennedy or raking or they don't last as long\n[noise] but there's a series of maples ... that there was developed probably ten twelve years ago he only has about twelve years ago um called the Freeman series and I think on and blaze is one of the first ones came up with a ... there are a hybrid between a red maple and a silver maple I Would never recommend silver maples anybody\nLifespan shorter lifespan fast growing but real weak with it you know just a lot of issues but here we got the best of both worlds red maple was great fall color\nHarder would great branching habit great structure of the tree with a faster growing tree of the silver and then they called the Freeman's selections and audit blaze is one of the first Sienna Glenn came after that\nFantasy celebration there are several of them out there right now but here's a tree really impressed with and it was the urban says the um [noise]\nAh the ... the municipal Arbor society tree of the year about ten years ago when that right after they first came out with a forty five fifty feet high forty five feet wide so good sized tree so good for streets stricter tree or or for a larger yards but fairly quick pace as far as giving you something a reasonable amount of time\nSo this particular series is called Freeman this particular series of of these hybrid maples really\nComing on strong and a lot of folks use him in a wide range of zones they do a very good job so a excellent three there you know one of my favorites I and I to trees are my favorites get go which grows about anywhere and baroque which grows about anywhere but they're both very slow growers\nI heard some of your experts talking about baroque um I don't know what a baroque is you know there are so many great oaks of ads they're baroque when you look at it has a huge relief I was just going to ask that the one with the big Lee yeah looks like a ... a pretty good size ache or as you get hit with one you know you got hit when it's a very\nMasculine very bold\nVery wide horizontal branching tree rounded out crown takes a while to get any size or when they do it's a majestic tree that you'll never forget when you see it because it's absolutely outstanding but gang country great history behind ... or the fans shave leaves great fall color to re trees there and I'll tell you the other one is really\nBecoming more and honor used but becoming more popular and that's dawn redwood now this is a regular redwoods clip destroys just like there are other ... so red wills that grow ... yep try or wet so if you get a body or they'll actually growing up in a moist area\nBut dawn redwood and it gives you it's a it's a deciduous conifer so he loses the needles at the end of the year\nBut you know here though it doesn't have leaves at Scott nice guy needles but in great shape tree great larger growing tree\nBeing used more and more all the time and then like I say the needles actually dropped at the end of the season they're not as thick and break down faster than pine or a some ruse would but that is becoming very very popular and rightfully so\nHow about the speed of growth on that Saturday older fan yeah once they get started there very fast grower\nSo again gives you something I read them out of time and and you think it's an evergreen additives and so how did I mention that Ron I don't I don't know I mean are you using that a lot yeah landscape and yeah I mean you'll see that in ... in Ireland plant things in parking lot just even now as a street tree\nI'm giving up plenty of room to grow because these are big they get they get huge but it's a it's an actual redwood any adjusts so well all different types of soil isn't that great tree so CNN when used a lot more out there as well I guess I gotta quit looking at all the houses in the entry\nI I got a new one on me to contractors and even some landscaper sometimes you just get locked into a certain palate er trees and they don't look at what else is available out there\nYou really if you if you if you have a house that has no trees at all do your homework to invest you visit two or three nurseries does it two or three garden center see what they suggest see what's out there and is what's available\nAnd of course plant that you can go you know right up to the holiday season with no problem well as long as that grabs not for long as it can ... a time of year right you can play at any time during the year so you know you can go you know it's up to you as long as they're available to plant so I was workable\nYou can get out their plan and I always tell folks to things when you're looking at a new home\nGet the turf established wherever your lawn is going to be a cause that you want to get that's your base\nAnd plant trees and evergreens first forget about the like the foundation forget about the patio plant they\nPlant trees and evergreens first they take the longest amount of time to develop and do anything for you know five years minimum they start to get any effect on on\nSupplant those first got back to your patio plant things in your foundation planting later because you know two years your foundation prize built in the field and on the hill is likely go do the trees and do the evergreens first and then you're good screen plant they get those in right away ... obviously very important to Burr Oak\nNarrowed on red ... or my two favorites are bigger trees but Don redwood and I'll get the Freeman's selections of the red maples okay it's a hybrid\nI think that's what I put my backyard about three years ago I I'm not very likely from eighty four you\nKnow what's funny if you look at how we fall colors passport you look at that that fall colors they last longer than the things that are flower mhm you think about him yeah color

something you're gonna have problems with the separation on it\nI Would go to the top grade residential or even go to a commercial and high traffic area certainly wouldn't need the master bathroom you would need a twenty eight mill but I still wouldn't go lessen the twelve\nOkay okay my concern yeah I just didn't wanna over by a right I understand it it man be then not satisfied with the way it goes away or you know that with my big concern sure over by\nYeah I think about it too when you have flooring moon when\nYou usually replace it is just because you know I mean you know it's just it

at roe while I don't like to go by what you found out I wanted to ugly out before it\nRight right and I guess that's you know so I don't ever really mind by an over buying per se because\nI don't want to have problems with the scene separation I don't want to have problems with Dullness on it where I got to replace it and it's really not super outta style or anything if you're going you know so

thing that it'd be you know when it's hot it's if it's power coming to it\nI don't know maybe I'm getting from phantom power from something else but they're not being around it but when I was my computer and threw it or radio no power as if I'm going to get to that um device\nWell I Would probably have a check further quite honestly by an electrician I I mean if you're having power through the wires I I Can't tell you if you're having phantom power in there or not but one thing and you bring up a good point there will be too it's not a bad idea really to walk around with your hand\nTo your outlets if you have an outlet does wore them they're not supposed to be warm ever\nAnd it doesn't say you know lose wire in a screw will create warmth in could produce a fire that's why we have

it's painted yeah okay\nSo we don't see any paint that's a cracking blistering peeling or anything like that that's allowing the would become compromised\nWell it it they it is um cracking and\nOkay so if we got in there and we started digging away at the ... and getting rid of the paint\nAnd uh there there are certainly ways to repair it\nUm but I Can't tell you if it's if you should repaired or you should replace it that's going to your decision but we can talk about repairing it if it looks like it's a little too much maybe it is time to go ahead and replace it\nAnd then the other question is how did it become compromised to begin with was the just the paint was\nCompromised in the water got all that and that's what causes the robbers there's something\nGoing on above the door that's
