show a family's financial health is also likely to be severely weakened even if they have insurance [noise] some people never do recover medical bills or the number one cause of bankruptcy according to a number of surveys and insurance may not help as much as you might say\nWe know that from surveys people say they are in deep financial trouble even if I have covered so if you read the insurance policy carefully and if you talk to people about what their experiences our insurance at this point doesn't offer real protection\nThat Dr David ... distinguished professor of public health center city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually sick most people are faced with such high co payments from the doctor boats that they are in deep financial trouble even if I have coverage so many\nTry co payments from the doctor bowls that they are in deep financial trouble even if they have coverage so many of us have policies that have a thousand or even two thousand dollars deductible before the insurance kicks in and\nAfter that a lot of policies say when you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and a hospital stay can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now than did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar deductible in this country\nAnd that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so deductibles are rising and co payments are rising and as you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which have\nHave help people but have still left some in deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of six thousand dollars now for most families a six thousand dollar half\nThat comes when you're sick and frankly in danger of losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected\nBut how common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all that what's the average bill for example that's left for someone to pay out of pocket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews sought to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we want to know what are the financial consequences of that\nAnd does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do this really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports just like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies we merged all of those credit report records with\nHospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat stuck or mask you know do we do do associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also co author of this study which search millions of hospital in financial records he\nSays there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise but the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well we\nDo see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average\nMan their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with adoptable then co payments on their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis they had was that some individuals just might not understand exactly what they need to pay or there could be ongoing disagreements about exactly what they need to pay and some of those disagreements might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency\nHowever is a little different for those without insurance the average patient is in the hospital for five days or so according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and no till would did do says they're here with higher unpaid bills as you'd expect yet it something else that hurts them the most financially\nAfter going to the hospital if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills\nAfter going to the hospital if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills and most of that almost all of it goes away if you are in short\nBut whether you're insured or uninsured both group seemed to be affected by a hospital admission in terms of their labor earnings\nTheir earnings declined by about twenty percent on average and that lasts for a number of years so it takes quite a while for people to go back to normal and for many people we also see some evidence that they ended up retiring early claiming Social Security earlier and in some cases even applying for disability insurance\nNo till we did go says that the most noteworthy finding of this study it's not medical bills that put the average family under financially when they're sick\nFor many people it seems difficult for them to return to work after they go to hospital and you know once we saw that it's not really that surprising I mean for some individuals when they go to the hospital to serious event it might make working more difficult there might be short term or even long term disability\nIt's not so surprising but it's not something we were thinking about it ahead of time which is just that after you go to the hospital and suffer some kind of health shock that so serious that you end up needing medical treatment\nPeople return to work slowly and they ended up experiencing earnings losses reductions in income for them is actually for their entire household that persists for many years\nIn many ways he says the labor dislocation after major illness looks a lot like a town where the major industry has suddenly closed\nAnd everyone loses their job and then they have to go back and try to find work in many of those case studies people take a long time to get back to where they were before and I think what was surprising to me it's just for how many people it looks very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\nHitler Stein says that's a major reason debts that occurred during a medical crisis or potentially much more damaging

time when you're earning ... going down at the same time that the bills are coming in and of course\nThe stress of illness and the disaster of illness is coming up the same time as the medical bills are coming yeah so that's different from buying a house or running up a bill on your credit card for other things and the other thing that's different about it is\nIt's going to have some effect and

that before my goodness we've actually seen people drink too much water and actually poison themselves with water\nBut we've never seen an individual eat so many vegetables that they poison themselves on vegetables it's just not possible and this is the the safety factor of the ... poly means\nThese are things we normally debt in plants and in the plants that we need the most so we have no toxicity

maybe Eighteen Inches great\nOK okay what have you tried to get it off ...\nWell watch my back go to the pressure was right but I don't know that you're probably taken away mortar fresh\nOr not if you don't you know might go to on that might be a pressure washer to Dan but yeah you just got to be\nYou know how to use a little common sense on the amount of pressure you and use from the pressure wash or what they mean by that is I probably would use like if you used a twenty four hundred PSI pressure washer and then you used a twenty five degree nozzle and you were Eighteen\nSo go ahead [laughter] well I mean by a pressure wash or that's like a twenty seven out of the U.S is I think that'd be a problem still\nOkay so if you have that let's backing off to a forty degree now so [noise] forty degree yeah okay\nSo you guys have already degree nozzle and then you still say Eighteen to twenty inches away from it\nAnd I it it'll probably be enough pressure to go ahead and take it off you may have to play around putting that you'll be fine if you go to a wider\nSand or of that uh nozzle that in terms of a cleaner oxygen needed bleach would be the cleaner you would use\nA United believe yeah and you hear me talk about one in there's different degrees of it I talked about the masonry defender dot com which is ... they have a masonry cleaner on that website which is a high grade oxygen needed bleach so\nIf your wife or they're ... they're All right so in it's a powder you mix was water you'd spraying on splashing on mopping on led said about ten minutes scrubbing rinse\n[noise] okay All right hey thank you so much great reach a\nVery good about things they care Bye bye good point by him two\nReally good point\nWhen you use the pressure was certain that I Love using pressure washer and people that have pressure wash or they love using pressures to ... game loop toys little fun but you can do a lot damage if you don't use it properly so if you have like a twenty seven hundred and they all up to like four thousand PSI\nProbably more than that\nYou don't want it I mean if you get thirty five hundred PSI pressure wash or twenty five degree nose will\nStart hitting a concrete driveway your twelve to Eighteen Inches away from that concrete you actually etch that concrete\nBut if you rent twenty four hundred twenty five degree knows well he changed the way you not\nNew clean it\nBut you might wanna sealed after that so you got to be just a little careful with it but you can use it you change it to a wider fan nozzle back off a little bit how close you are\nBut even if even use the water or a pressure wash your own brick inspect the brick and he said missing mortar in that is a problem you got to make sure that you don't have missing motor ever\nOn your house like a couple of good stories about that too but a pass we'll get to Dan Dan welcome\nGary thank you so much for taking my call you have a great detail\nThings are a I Need your help here but\nI Do a lot of myself and I'm working at a vile crank [noise] in my\nDay on on the floor [noise] and I got about eleven hundred square feet down there\nAnd it ended up here to all be about the crap and leveling the floor always is\nUm [noise] I'll have a problem with grinding coffee grinder on the scene and getting that helped me out with the level and um\n... how about you how far away [laughter] it can be a big deal it can be a big deal\nYeah they're not we're not bad guy or the back on the vinyl plank is three sixteen over ten feet and I'm right on that edge I might have a little bit more than that but overall I'm In pretty good shape but I Do want to get a good\nWell there is floor level lawyers that are on the market either pre mixed or the ones you have to mix and ... and ... it's self leveling for the most part um or if you wanted to you what I usually use the two by four you get yourself an eight foot two by four used as a slow\nYou pour the floor level are on there and you just run that two by four over with\nThey put two by four used as a float you pour the floor level are on there and you just run that two by four over which will spread that evenly in level it out\nOkay I Will I been guys on line using ... and I didn't I mean more like our then\nYeah well you know if you got a two by four I think that's the perfect way I mean that's the big long float get somebody on the other end of that and just run that over perfect\nPerfect 'cause ... you know it's the floor in Europe put on there's you know it just needs to be level just means dirty and level and that will certainly accomplish that task okay in ... and ... sometimes be way of an inch inch and a half that's a problem\nYeah yeah um how ... how about the craft it's the talk I feel that with the level or\nUm what you're going to have to it it'll probably just crack right through I mean but it'll be level right right you know ... yeah you know if I Do know that\nI didn't know there is a different uh [noise] a different product\nThat I just remember that that salt cut their is designed to be the weakest joined a slave in case you have some movement it'll correct in that crack mhm and if you put Flora level or overt it's going to correct so but that's OK you're floors can be over but you wouldn't even know will correct\nOkay so I was just concerned with using that much horror level in that middle crack a cart why indeed huh how white or they ah well at the top of um they got to be a good half that of course why real yeah\nAnd where you at all I've got all that was something oh\nOkay uh any ideas who suggests [laughter]\nI think what I Would do is if there that white I just haven't seen them that way I Will get a backer rod\nIn a backer rod is like foam rope\nOkay that comes in different sizes half inch five age three quarters inch in just push it down in there get it down below the surface and them run your level or over that they'll just keep it from you know going into nowhere land\nRight you won't waste the floor level or social just sick simply a backer rod is called back or rod cost saver things like that\nOkay I'm kind of almost looks like it's a tall or close to\nAn actual ... okay All right let's put it won't matter just put that back or ride in there if it's real deep they'll just say from wasting the floor level [noise]\nSo I'm great thank you
