usually get a chance to hear from somebody so they've got a fairly flexible schedule for us this morning a buck President Trump himself what did he have to say about John tester\nA last night via Twitter a he said this quote ever since his vicious and totally false statements about admiral Ronny Jackson\nThe highly respected White House doctor for Obama Bush and me [laughter] that sounds like a documentary doesn't Obama Bush me Senator Jon tester looks to be in big trouble in the great state of Montana\nHe behaved worse than the Democrat mob did with justice K behaved worse than Democrat mom did with justice Kay what do you think about that ah what\nWhat situation was worse here are the way the way the the Democrats like Feinstein and others treated justice Brett Kavanaugh better than ... confirmation hearings here\nOr or what Jon Tester did to admiral an Iraq War veteran Ronny Jackson anyway throw that question out to you for oh six to nine four\nZero nine Seventy ... cabinet company phone lines if you ever want to jump in on the conversation but uh yeah so the up\nSo the story out of out of North Dakota I think this is ... is really interesting not only because we have a lot of you know a lot of people were closed business and family ties between Montana and North Dakota ... a lot of people in eastern Montana\nUm aside their their radio is the only thing they get that has Montana news and information right\nAt the TV stations combat or North Dakota in some of these places are our friends and Glenda they got it all met our friends at the a K ex GM and in Glendale they got they carry Montana talks on the radio they also ... and\nThey also carry the uh the local TV news out of billings too so they they got it all Montana in in Glen dive but uh but there's parts of of eastern Montana particularly northeastern Montana where\nYou know a Montana newspaper may not even show up until nine or ten o'clock at the corner store\nAnd uh of course by that point the news is all new anyway but and and the TV stations come out of North Dakota and a pencil radio really is there only Montana news and information they they sometimes you're getting in these areas aside from social media but the but that's why there's a lot of close connections between Montana North Dakota plus\nAs Heidi Heitkamp is basically cannot recover in this Senate race over in North Dakota I'm that means resources will also shift to places like Montana\nUm where where are you as far as what we're hearing it's neck and neck between liberal Democrat Senator Jon Tester and the conservative state auditor Matt Rosendale here in Montana and so the and that's that's the deal here to look if the race was not close\nPresident Trump would not be coming to Montana there's other places he can go if the race was not close um if if conservatives did not have a chance of winning this US Senate race here in Montana President Trump would not be coming here they have the data they have the inside\nUm they also know that everything has changed post cabinet confirmation hearings even further just given how nasty the liberal Democrats like Jon Tester and Dianne Feinstein were\nOr what their treatment of justice Brett Kavanaugh but for ... goes back even further I mean\nKavanaugh was just round to\nRound one was the way he shame fully treated a navy admiral Ronny Jackson but the but

they wouldn't be ... you would not be able to fit all of the people even there but could you imagine a the traumatic stress that that would cause for some of\nSome of those liberals on the campus if that were to actually happen because they would literally the campus would be filled full of of of Trump supporters I'm uh in fact I thought it was interesting last Saturday I told you before the trumpet a rally was even announced in Missoula\nThere was already a couple of ... students who are planning a pro Trump rally the rally in support of the president\nAnd they ended up getting about a hundred people that showed up for this thing which is actually a pretty decent turnout now of course it got down blade and in some of the news outlets but uh uh the ... part of the Montana television network had had good fare coverage on it but some of the other outlets kind of downplayed a but yeah a they\nHad like a hundred people just show up just without him even being there\nUm but that'd be interesting but yeah it's going to be a in fact I'm going to check it out that there was a a a story I think it was by Hawley Michael's\nUh for the ... newspapers that said that they are expecting about eight thousand people\nA tonight so they must be figuring out a good way to get a ... a as large of a number as possible inside the hangar but I Know when he was in billings they had you know a loudspeaker set up they had large video screen set up a cause that was something that President Trump basically said that he wanted to see happen from here on out because when he showed up in great falls\nIn only about sixty five hundred people were able to make it inside the expo center there were six thousand other people outside wanting to see President Trump they couldn't make it in and so he so even set on stages like next time out\nWhat we're gonna have some video screens or something and he's like this is this just unacceptable I felt bad for all the folks who couldn't make it in so I'm so it sounds like they're doing everything they can do to be able to pack the folks in to the Trump rally in Missoula tonight\nUm but yeah they're expecting to eight thousand people at that rally tonight so uh so should be a good turn out there are some of the top stories at Fox News radio is tracking for us here all morning long I'm a Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein\nHere she goes again

I'm with where I'm like okay there's there's the political story which yes there should be accountability demanded for here okay you're you your campaign out at the sexual assault survivors but you won't out the campaign staffer who is responsible for this\nAnd I think it's important in fact I think authorities should investigate that question\nBecause where did she get these names from I mean if these women didn't want to be publicly identified and if some of them weren't even a survivors where did she where did they get these names from\nUm because if if there were people who were sworn to follow the law when it comes to hit the health privacy act protection laws those people need to be held accountable\nOh I was so I mean what what is the point of having HIPAA laws if it's not going to be enforced um especially for something\nLike this I mean it's not like they said oh yeah that that ballot that a senator a gal that guys on the you know he's taken some sleeping pills when he travels overseas ...\nAh you know it's not like that was that don't know they publicly identified survivors of sexual assault a wrongfully so and so somebody news and how they're gonna but also okay so now if we find out who and which organizations\nOkay did they violate HIPAA laws or was there something about these organizations that was deliberately collecting data on these women in about these women and then deliberately and maybe according to their little disclosures\nGiving that information to third parties like political campaigns and candidates or a day of that is the case\nThat as an even bigger controversy here I'm In something that needs to be called to account for a so so either either the the people that provided these women's names to the high camp campaign broke the law\nOr there's a bigger controversy about maybe the organizations that they work for or a part of a are are doing our part of an even in even bigger scandal here uh that's the deal so that's the much bigger more important story about protecting not just these women but but other women in their same situation\nUm then there's also the political story which is okay\nAh voters I think I've just had it with this hypocrisy from Senate Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp like Dianne Feinstein like Jon Tester we have just had you people will step on anybody say anything to do anything\nJust to get reelected\nAnd and and the reason why incumbents like Heidi Heitkamp have have typically survived in the best and the reason incumbents like Jon Tester have survived in the past is because they have a press corps they grumbled at their feet three hundred and sixty four days out of the year\nThat cheer leads for them three hundred and sixty four days out of the year that copy and paste their press releases into their news stories three hundred and sixty four days out of the year and so voters here their names over and over again\nIn ... oh yeah oh okay well hey you know I Know the name\nAnd so um but but at least in North Dakota not and I'm hoping so here in Montana it's it it it's just gotten so bad that their records are so bad that Heidi Heitkamp have gone so far to the left that Jon Tester has been so far he Jon Tester is more to the left of Heidi Heitkamp\nThat voters are finally they're seeing it and they're seeing their seeing these these guys for what they actually what they actually stand for and their voting records do not line up with Montanans and with Montana values so\nSo they need to be just as just simply voted out you know apology or no apology with this whole big commercial about it\nBut but John ... is he worse is what John tester did\nTo to adjust to ah the Iraq War veteran a navy ever run into is that worse than what was done to justice Brett Kavanaugh that's what President Trump says he says ever since as vicious and totally false statements about admiral Ronny Jackson a highly respected White House doctor\nFor Obama Bush and me Senator Jon tester looks to be in big trouble in the great state of Montana\nHe behaved worse than the Democrats mob did with justice Kay [noise] um you know I I [noise] situation which situation is worse um you know it's it's hard to peg that\nUh you know here here you had John tester who trashed a good man and his family Iraq War veteran admiral Ronny Jackson\nThere's so much about veterans why did he treats that veteran that way\nYou know and is it worse than what Heidi Heitkamp did you know publicly exposing a sexual assault survivors putting them in harm's way now potential is result now now\nThey're former abusers know where they live maybe even know what their new name is they're married name now compared to most their previous named might have been\nSo you've now given their attacker their name and their location\nOr you know um but at least Heidi Heitkamp is apologizing Jon Tester has refused to apologize for what he did a Ronny Jackson\nEven after Secret Service records came out and said\nHey that incident did not happen you know ... and not only did that incident not happen but but Ronny Jackson has has a stellar remarkable career at the White House not just under President Trump but under all eight years of rock Obama he was the White House doctor\nNo apology from Jon Tester ... it's it's just complete arrogance at this point it again it's not even about being a Democrat or Republican it [noise] it it's just about your humanity at this point\nIt will if you allow somebody to get away with stuff like this and they just and they don't even have the humanity to apologize and just say\nHey I screwed up I you know I was wrong now Heidi Heitkamp her credit she's she's in North Dakota saying hey I screwed up our campaign screwed up I take responsibility for it a ... year Jon Tester won't even woman up like like Heidi Heitkamp as at least a woman now now now the voters of of\nNorth Dakota they they might forgive Heidi Heitkamp for this campaign ad you know they might forgive her for that but uh what what they're not going to forgive her for what they will hold are accountable for at the ballot boxes or as her voting record\nIn voting against justice Kavanaugh on Trump's nominees and things like that I'm now you made but at least Heidi Heitkamp was a woman enough to apologize assassin screwed up you know 'cause I don't care who you are if you can't just say well yeah\nYeah I I I screwed up then you know look yourself in the mirror start to question yourself I'm\n... and and that is I think it is\nThat almost worse than I Do know is that worse than Jon Tester's voting record in your view do you think do you think is worse that he refuses to admit he's wrong when he's wrong the fuse that refuses to apologize when he wrong fully um trash somebody's name and character reputation I mean\nWhat what's what's worse his liberal voting record where he's not voting the way Montanans want him to vote\nOr the fact that he isn't humble enough\nAnd and just you know I guess has the common decency to just say\nKnow what I screwed up and I apologize why why why is that so hard\nI don't know I mean I don't know I don't know about you but [laughter] yeah I don't know it's like you know if it should be a relatively easy thing to just say if if you grow up in Montana\nYou know I I I Love the old Conrad Burns quote Conrad Burns he had a lot to pull up the actual quote like Conrad Burns he had wanted he always had these great one liners but one of his one liners was hey we all screw up\nYou know some of us on a daily basis the key is not to exceed jerk quota [laughter] you know we're all going to grow up the kids not to exceed you're going I don't know I'm I'm sure I have exceeded my quota\nOr a time or two in my uh less than forty years are plenty of plenty of of ah of screw it up and doing stupid things but at least they say hey yeah you know what screwed up but the him a fix it moving forward you know what I mean like that's that's why I Love\nBecause you learn those types of things you learn like hey yeah hey the ref didn't make throw the flag you wanted the raft call and yeah maybe the rats should've thrown the flag there\nBut so what ... focused on the last play because you got three more place sitting in front of you until you got to kick the ball to the other team so get back in there\nYou know what I mean and and I don't know but these these poly\n... that's why it's ... it's almost like these these politicians it's just like you know they they get back to Washington DC and you know Jon Tester's been back there for twelve years now he's got this nice little row house million dollar cosmopolitan row house on Capitol Hill and\nHe's got people kissing his running every day because he's a United States senator\n...

which\nWe needed personnel and money for them for people guys down there protecting our southern border\nAnd you know he votes against that\nAnd but yet people tend to forget that I guess and they don't realize that when you hear these ads that he's running right now that he's for veterans and for a border heat up homeless is\nA up for the\nPeople come across the border where GM Ford and he says he wants to than you know I have followed me that that's their memories are so short I mean remember remember certain parts of their life but yet when it does involve their life and their future they can just forget all of\nA ... year voted\nMessage thing point um and I think timely too because well I mean what do you think do you think if if President Trump were to hammer one point home tonight what do you think it should be should be about border security and building a wall or what what do you think is one point that he should amber tonight should be\nWell I talked to a lot of people even the guy that I work with the prime of the election at the time of campaign and I\nSaid I Would almost if I could possibly get down here I Would just love to go pound a concrete safe down here on that southern wall so we talked a lot of people\nThat if we knew that our money would go into a special fund and not somehow get into a democratic can forget a ... year old fuel or somewhere else or some scam artist gets a hold of it all\nI send a hundred dollars through a special fund to go down there and build our stinking wall\nYou know it needs to get full yeah you know going back to

males why do I say that because\nI get these folks are fleeing maybe they're fleeing socialism and south as south or Central America maybe they're fleeing violence in their country but you know what I just want to say these military age males\nMan up like the rest of us have had to do and defend your country defend your family's defend your village defend your town\nAnd why are you fleeing a man of like Americans have done time and time again and defend your own town instead of just fleeing from it I get leaner women and children okay ah I get it but but why should these military age and it just drives me nuts\nI Know like I said\nYou know I don't know what they're doing if they're doing it so they can get the voters and people in this country do not realize it but if the Democrat ever ever as their plan with the illegals and everything else they've been doing it in this country if they ever get control of this country\nThe Republican base has known right now is you'll never get a fact because they all have the illegal and the other corruption so it'll be there forever and there were we won't be able to go after\nAll right well Steve appreciate your phone call you and you're talking about abortion security immigration all that yeah I mean I remember those back what January February and member when they had the government shutdown and the government actually shut down a for a little while\nAnd and it was Senate Democrats that wanted to shut the government uh down over illegal immigrants and and then finally they were losing that battle it was probably the first time ever that Democrats have lost a government shutdown debate in the PR world they were losing the PR a side of it\nSo they finally caved in and voted to reopen the government but some a minority of some liberal senators voted to continue the government shutdown choosing illegal immigrants over our troops to illegal immigrants over us\nUp in and that was John tester you write voted to continue the government should do well in cold it's interesting that you bring up border security especially as President Trump is coming back to Montana cars and told her the conservative commentator Ann Coulter yesterday via Twitter\nNow um yeah I'd love to mix it up more with him but we get our phone lines are completely full right now so I I definitely want to get to some other callers here also but

I I feel like I'm I'm familiar with is not the shorthand survey for the census says it\n[noise] um I'm not sure it just a lot of personal questions about people in your health for a first\nIs your ethnicity or do you speak English well\nAnd then they ask you about your\nRaised you have what's the value what are you paying taxes is just a lot of stuff that I feel for the first or not anyone and I'm just wondering you know if you're required by law they make it sound like you are required\nTo them just doing quick search yeah I Believe that is the that is the official name of the census basically the the the official census survey if I'm not mistaken I Know we've got people who've worked for the census before who listen to the shows that they can call ...\n... ... which which is funny is yeah so they're asking you all these questions like well how many how many rooms do you have in your house and uh [noise]\nUh tell us all the details of your firstborn child type stuff\nBut yet the one question that that folks on Capitol Hill are freaking out about was the citizenship question are you a citizen of this country they were freaking how dare you asked people live there are a citizen in this country\nWhen is the official census for this country but yet they're they're not raising any hey about well how many rooms do you have in your house or what what is the easiest way to enter in the middle of the night do you have a security system you know what I mean it's almost getting back to the U.S [noise] yeah\nFor under a lot of stuff that I really don't care below wandering off I'm required\nYou know I don't I don't know if you're required to do I would encourage you to do so because because the more Montanans that responded those surveys taken effect is that the number of dollars that Montana guess so I'd rather have the dollars come to Montana than to go to California\nUm so we can effect that if you can also affect representation in the U.S house of representatives but if there's questions you don't like\nUm you know hey fill it out to everyone I won't give you guys there\nBut now when it comes to like ethnicity though you can check any box you want now because I mean based on a Elizabeth Warren's we're all Native American now are almost all of us are because they just to trace a DNA sample and boom we get to call ourselves whatever we want to smoke so ah it\nUnfortunately it's not a George Strait song it's not just to check yes or no it's a well are you this or are you that are are you this and meanwhile the rest of us like\nI'm an American okay uh so would you just asked me if I'm American or not where I live and then we just be done with it here or a thorough six to nine four zero nine Seventy is the phone number if you want to jump in on the conversation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "city": "Billings", "day": "18"}
