T. Q. candidates are running for office so they got this of this big piece all focused on the fact that there's elegy B. T. Q.\nCandidates who are running for office\nAnd they did an interview with the self described democratic socialist transgender candidate Amelia markets so apparently grew up here and buildings as Alonzo Marquez for anybody who for any of you might have known Alonzo\nNow Emilia running as a Democrat socialist candidate for the legislature a hearing in billings and up any way up up up apparently\nThe focus is not on well what are you going to do for the voters apparently all the talk at NPR is about pronouns\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanting to make that the big issue of this raid wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nI I have practice in all of the major areas that face a district court judge in Yellowstone county I always tell people when we talk look there are three major areas they're civil there's criminal and there's family law I Am the one candidate in my race\nThat his practice in all three areas have been a prosecutor I've been a criminal defense attorney\nI've done family law extensively represent fathers representing mothers representing children and civil litigation on both the plaintiffs and civil dependence size\nSide or additionally I've worked in significant numbers of areas of law that all appear before the court a bus like I said civil litigation criminal law property law real estate law all types of manners and individuals who are going to face I have worked in those areas\nWill and I don't imagine over years whether it was as a first sergeant in the military or as an attorney or here here in town\nYou've heard all the excuses if you've heard all that well I didn't do this because of like a year and that's that's what I kinda like about you being a judge here in Yellowstone county is that\nIs that hey you you can empathize with people you've obviously got a great commitment to this state into this nation but you're also not going to tolerate a bunch of nonsense and at the end of the day\nWe want to judge is not going to tolerate a bunch of nonsense from some of these criminals out there when they will talk more with a judge a judicial Kennedy Tom party joining us right here in Studio plus I've got the numbers are you

news talk thirty five point five\nThere in Flint here was Montana's talks a coming up an eight o'clock hour we're going to plenty of time to take your phone calls about anything and everything you want to talk about four or six to nine four zero nine Seventy a in ... and then coming up in the nine o'clock hour congressman Greg ...\nIs going to join us for the entire hour taking your phone calls answering your questions as a good elected officials shouldn't be doing right you know being accountable to the voters so ah so anyway so keep that number written down but also right now if you want to jumping on this conversation as we talked with a judicial candidates Tom party\nA PA already why that's a salad or he spells party or you give us a ring to nine four zero nine Seventy [noise]\nAh Yeah Tom party that great to have you here in Studio\nI'm so a lot of people they don't know I was I was just a meet with a group of guys yesterday and they're like hey you vote on these judicial races and I was like well look here here's the numbers that have been put out really the only information we have to go off of other than Kennedy questions and profiles\nIs this information compiled by the Montana Family Foundation where they went in track and this is and they're conservative group but but but this information is even helpful tool or you know to folks maybe more left is they went and compiled all the campaign contributions the political\nContributions from judicial candidates to political candidates of the various parties and they say okay well this judicial candidates are gave this much money solita Democrats this judicial candidates gave money solely to Republicans now we don't want our courts to be Republican courts are Democrat courts\nBut what I found interesting is I Believe in your race according to this data compiled by the Montana Family Foundation um\nYou gave zero political contributions which I have for for somebody running for judge that's that's fine with us because that shows that maybe this guy isn't beholden either political party is he's just going to be a fair judge\nBut your opponent or according to this data uh she's contributed about six thousand dollars of political campaign contributions\nOne hundred percent to democratic candidates I mean does this does this raise a question among the voters that hey you know and no matter how great of a person is this person may be\nIt's solely to one party will there be fairness on the bench I to be fair to everybody involved we've come down to the last four candidates I'm comfortable there will be fairness on the bench no matter who is selected [laughter]\nI don't get into contributions and things like that it's inappropriate for we candidates to discuss those things\nAre the thing I Would point out is most contributions that you see are being publicized are pre judicial race contributions\nBecause as you digital candidates we're prohibited under the\nRules of conduct for the judicial code of ethics et cetera to contribute to other candidates\nYeah that kind of makes it nice to have any kind of get left and right yeah yeah when you first get into your initial thought a as a candidate you know this whole process is a minefield that you got a tip toed through\nYour initial thought is well that would make sense that we cannot accept contributions from political candidates that are partisan political candidates that makes sense because it's good to have a perception as correct as it may be that you're being influenced\nWell then you learn as you go through this process or you're just so candidate you cannot contribute and I didn't learn this right away\nI found it out subsequently you cannot contribute to parties and candidates because then it looks like you're endorsing them but once again I Want to be clear that once you become a judge or become a judicial candidates prior to hire contributions are completely legal and ethical\nYet but uh you know for the voters that might give you a at least an indication for people who are looking for more information that might give you an indication of well maybe this person Neal maybe his opponent leans more to the left based on those contributions maybe he's more down the middle a you know it it it's just it's just an indicator\nOf this so this came up there so there's a another judicial race on the ballot this uh this November also a few days ago we spoke with Ashley her rada\nWho is also running for a for a district for a separate district judge a seat in addition to yours here\nAnd um her her she took issue with something that her opponent said her opponent said that she believes the constitution as a living breathing document and ... that's\n... that the that cannot be the case you have to rule on the constitution as it is you can't just well now I I don't like this about the constitution so I'm just going to change it but do you uh where do you fall or when it comes to you know is the constitution and living breathing document or or not\nIt is not it is my position that I Will follow the law the law says I must I Will the law says I Can't I won't\nAnd frankly the U.S constitution and the Montana constitution are the law as I've said previously I took an oath to support and defend the constitution of the United states in the state of Montana and I will do that again and that doesn't mean I get to change it I Will support independent and I will\nFollow it that that I was just kind of laughing when you're talking about taken an oath to to defend the constitution yeah it wasn't an oath to well been the constitution or maybe shredded up or just kind of change it yeah I'd take an oath to make the constitution whatever I Want it to be a a where I decided to do and I woke up this morning\nA art what's ... what's been the most fun about this or I mean we're we're we're coming to a close I mean absentee ballots are out right now what do you think eighty percent of the voters in Yellowstone county may vote absentee what's the number\nI I think I heard a bread on the radio that they face a Seventy five thousand ballots went out as far as we know this race maybe over right now but we can't count on that yeah it does an additional what twenty five thousand up for grabs\nWe're going to be stand my wife and I are going to be standing on the street corner with are big signs bowl party for judge are still going to whatever functions we can go to visibly\nAnd I are going to be standing on the street corner with our big science bowl party

your paint party a for judge shirt so you've got a good so you'll have a lot of a gym clothes after the end of this race\nAbsolutely ed and ed kind of as a follow up to you said what's been the most fun part getting out talking to people meeting to people\nThat's the fun part uh going to these judicial candidates forum you know we've had several in a decent town do several of those and those are great opportunity for us to be on display together as a posting candidates and for voters to get informed I Will say I don't know how much time you and I have\nWith which we see morning starting in

that people were more designer brand conscience and would not cut back on those and so these studies change decade by decade and immigrant country to country\nNow it's more the vital essential there are things that people will spend more money on the one I I was there was ... yes I Will definitely spend more money to have good coffee I take it I'm not alone in that one or\nNot and it's not just the commodity the coffee it is the coffee experience that people are paying for it is that\nThe uplifting wake up good experience now I Know that I can\nCome to my cure Rick here at the office and push a button and not have a big old man\nProbably spend a fraction of that money by through in the coffee here even if I use the tools to seek out the cured but uh uh there there's something about that waiting in line at Starbucks or wherever\nThat people just have to do as experience and it's interesting that we are all about fixing it touches clothes and comfort we talked about they won't\nSend big money on designer jeans and a polo shirts so they will spend more on undergarments undergarments or top priority item for a lot of both versus the outer garment starting off um people

by though and to the kitty cats and uh it's kind of interesting that so we don't cut back when it comes to the animals we bought\nThat might be the one way where we hear Montana for maybe from the rest of the country we're not going to be for that dog in the luckier if\nHe gets scraps of beef from what we get much basically if I'm hearing you right then there's been a shift in consumer trends from\nThe parents to more personal comfort but also the household goods people are more interested in being comfort in sat at home basically that to me that's like kind of a train [noise] absolutely\nAnd it's kind of interesting that will for more concerned about the comfort of the bed receive sense where we spend maybe seven to ten hours a day who knows a lot of time for some folks are\nUnder your up before the crack of dawn up there but in addition the soap operas and the big screen TV are areas were spend more money on but the basic kitchen appliances become send to cut back

might be you know re Britain's you want to use on long term aside [noise] I'm BRCA gene fourteen candidate for Congress and I approve this message\nFor by Greg from Montana\n\nEnjoying the show anytime my calling the room rocks cabinet company fall in line at four O. six to nine four zero nine Seventy ... Montana talks on ... ... am nine Seventy and news talk Ninety five point five\nWell it was without a planning this out this way you know is talking about the the economic news here in Montana now I don't care who you want to ... why do care about who you want to credit but either way it doesn't matter who you credit for the\nIs it's happening a you know six point nine percent increase in wage and salary income for Montana's average household a directly as a result of the tax cutting jobs that a plus a Kevin Hassett chair of President Trump's council of economic advisors\nOr talked about how mining lodging in construction have seen the highest unemployment gains two thousand jobs added since Trump has been an office are gross state product grew three and a half percent in Trump's first year\nAs opposed to point six percent the year before a so when you talk about six point nine percent increase whether that your salary or wage income that is huge for people I mean that gives people the chance to finally do something that they've always been wanting to do\nA anyway Steven widely here with room rock cabinet company of course a great sponsor of the show Steve and great to see it back here in the studio get a good to see you to have you been seeing that economic this kind of first hand with a lot more people saying hey I finally have the ability to remodel\nAre there but really if you invest in a nice kitchen it's going to pay off when you're trying to either sell your house or just like you say just become for all the things I I just I randomly saw one of your ... cabinet company tweets via Twitter last night it's kinda fun to see some of the cabinet designs and some of the kitchens that you've got a on your on your Twitter page [noise]\nUm but the other thing that that triggers that hey maybe it it doesn't even come down to remodel in your entire kitchen maybe it's just saying hey hey give us a call and we can show you you know how we can add space in your kitchen we can give you extra space that you might not even know is there just by just by shuffling things around a little bit I I\nAbsolutely you know the function of your kitchen is is super important you know how how you store spices or how your pantry is functioning you know you open the doors and half the stuff falls out on the ground\nUm that is probably not the best way to organize and so we do have solutions and stuff for that um you know it was interesting the gentleman that was just on and he was talking about where you're investing your your money and I thought it was real funny that they were talking that people are spending more on their underwear and toilet paper\nUm we're seeing people do exactly that spend some money on the stuff that they're used it and that they actually need\n'em to function well so uh we we've seen an uptick in that and we're more than happy to help out with that\nIt will what was kinda cool about that too is that um you know people they are they're focusing more on on being comfortable and their families being comfortable and just really just enjoying life instead of just superficial outward appearance type stuff they by and large you know\nAnd uh and from that standpoint I mean part of remodeling your kitchen and that goes back to him saying that they're shifting to household a things also they're shifting back to their own homes are shifting back to household items\nUm the weather is just coffee or toilet paper like he was talking about based on this a consumer survey of Americans and what good's they're buying and why they will spend a little bit more for this versus that\nI'm In kind of kitchens or one of those things that it's it's not even just about having a nice kitchen that will impress your friends and neighbors when they come by for dinner it's really about ease and comfort\nUm but but the look can can have some it can be a comfort factor for people to\nAbsolutely you know I mean people want to be authentic you know there's there's so much of that stuff kind of going around where you know they're getting back stab talked about on Facebook whatever it might be\nAnd um when they come home you know whether whether it be a comfortable bed whether it be comfortable underwear socks\nOr just an awesome place to sit down and be with your family um that's kind of what we want want folks to enjoy we want them to understand that we're about making their home super inviting that they can sit down with their family and enjoy it day after day and it functions well\nYeah and and you think about this societal impact that that can have you know like\nI'm One of the things I'm excited about it our houses is having a a you know finally got one of those island sinks and then sold so like a little I'm kind of like the like bar set up where you can have some some stool sitting there\nAnd so you know it just because it's just hard to get everybody to sit at an actual dinner table anymore but it's so easy to just pop pop up on a you know a little bar stool table right at the little kitchen counter and talk to your kids about their school day and you know have a cup of coffee or something like that you know\nYeah I mean the coolest part is is is beginning to sit at home and not have your too you know kid texture from three feet away actually having a real conversation with him and um we're about providing those type of environments to where you can hang out um hopefully you know as parents we sit down and say hey\nKids suffer side have a great meal and actually enjoys and time again um we're we're that hasn't happened you know a ... in general out there most folks are stuck on their phone doing some of those things so you know our our desire is is looked provide an awesome environment\nFamily and a kind of remove a lot of those world worries away from you uh when you come home\nYeah and rock habit companies of course a great a great billings business story you guys have

better just because a lot of the big contractors of wrapped up other projects\nYou absolutely right now we we we kind of take the time we've got a lot of time to sit down really take on some of the time to kind of design it for you not necessarily that you need to be doing a project in you know the next six weeks if you want it to 'em you know that's kind of your Christmas and Thanksgiving

Scott what's on your mind [noise] Hi Aaron\nI'm what's on my mind as I was working with a lady in the\nCarbon county yesterday that has an issue with FEMA and the flood maps that they put out in carbon county our our county commissioners is sad that they're having to fail fail a federal mandate to put in these flood zones\nBut when you actually look at this lady's property it has the same elevation as her neighbor across the road from her and yet her property as in a flood zone and the neighbor as not\nAnd here's the real last year that she had she paid four hundred and twenty five dollars for a premium on flood insurance for last year she got a renewal notice and for the next year they wanted four thousand dollars\nWow [noise] yeah and I mean she lives a mile away from the Clark Fork river that house hasn't had any evidence of fled said that was built\nAnd I think this is part of the overreach that FEMA has in our counties in Montana and the worst part of it is they arbitrarily draw these flood maps in your county and then it ... who's the landowner whose property was placed in there\nTo have to spend thousands of dollars to prove to the image that they're not in a flood plain instead of making FEMA to actually do their due diligence and actually map out the low lying areas but\nI'll tell you if you're going to have a flood on the clerks for whether it's the clerks pork ah south of billings between ... and red lodge or whether it's the clerk four separate river near Missoula going to have a flood this this past year was the was the year to have it given all that snow rain right\nNow and her property wasn't even remotely close to having any issues of flooding whatsoever so forcing people to buy flood insurance when there's literally no chance of them filing filing a claim and getting any a relief for benefit\nReally is an absurd situation that was put together by FEMA\n... will Scott procedure phone call and thanks for getting it on the radar a congressman gene ... is is a topic that's been spilling over the banks why was\nIt was just an issue with federal overreach and we see it in so many years was waters of the U.S these FEMA maps confiscation of property rights\nAnd ah ah Scott I Would just say there is an appeal process you are right\nIt cost legal fees but\nMontana's shouldn't have to go through this defend their property rights if our office can help at all we have a couple of case workers here in the state uh we I found the ah the the the current administration much more amenable to commonsense\nArguments we do a couple of advocacy letters all week on behalf of Montanans in cases like this\nI Would encourage if you speak with the the gal who's having this issue if we can help it all just reach out to our office and we'd love to see if we can shine a light in there\nThat congressional case where it can be a way to put a ... at least a little sticky note on that a letter that might be sticking on this\nTrying to live in there yeah that congressional case work it can be a way to put a ...\nAt least a little sticky note on that a letter that might be sticking on this stack of that bureaucrats desk back there somewhere in Washington maybe shaken ... yeah and maybe shaken lose their ego alright phone lines are open let's go to John in Kyla listening to K. J. J. R. John your thoughts for congressman gene ...\nNovel it'd be sitting here my reloaded real sick it about a withdrawal or talking about one of the things that bothers me is the amount of\nTheir Democratic Party are showing advocating violence they sit on this why aren't we respond like Republicans just either and I don't do anything and the Democrats Justice Roberts said where there is a well oiled\nMachine six weeks and we're sitting on our hands I mean years ago you were from already in the Senate and house and we haven't exactly nothing [noise]\nAll right well thanks thanks so much for your call John ah yeah congressman gene forty your thoughts\n[noise] well I you know we've seen it this is not a fringe element of the Democrat Party this is the leadership Maxine Waters advocating for a civil disobedience abusing people in restaurants\n... ... a ... and you know sitting for the flag and disrespecting are veterans Hillary Clinton\nA saying that she will only be civil when she's in charge yeah Eric Holder I mean you just get down to less than they are if they do a lot of random right this is not a fringe element this is the core I think conservatives are better than that\nI mean I I just don't think we should resort to the same tactics I and I and the message I have for those listening is working with President Trump were delivering results in America is back we you know we talked about wages are up sort of John ...\nShould Republicans can they and how should they hold a the Democrat leadership accountable for for this\nWell I Would say to the point is well I mean he's right we need to build the wall we need to secure the border the houses appropriated I Believe it's five billion dollars at this point to do exactly that part of the issue is the national media is not reporting the progress that we've made\nIt showing up in the economic data but it continues to persist in regulatory relief\nThe funding for our military we're beginning to take care of our veterans one thing that got has not gotten reporter long at all and this is something we don't always like to talk about but it's a reality\nWe have a problem in this country with human trafficking young girls and women getting sold and there was a loophole Milwaukee\nEven here in Montana attorney general muscle memory injury you guys sat down together just a week\nAgo we did but here's the good news\nWe passed a law and the house earlier this year the Senate passed it the president signed it he shuts down the website back page and eighty percent of the other Web sites that were trafficking in girls and young women and our communities are safer as a result the national media\nNever reported on it\nYeah it gets crazy and that has a huge huge topic that yet we've even seen right here in our own backyard in Montana up real quickly 'cause I Want to get a lot of callers on the line but how much has the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings changed the political battle map heading into the November elections\nWhen I think it's really crystallized is the positions of the two parties um and I I hear it 'cause I'm I'm always travel in the state and when I'm not when I'm traveling as long as I have cell phone coverage I'm dial in and I'm Talking to folks and I will say there are people I was ...\nThe state and when I'm not when I'm traveling as long as I have cell phone coverage I'm dial in and I'm Talking to folks and I will say there are people I was talking to a gentleman down in Hamilton\nAnd he was in the ... office and he had um folks coming in out of the blue ... never been involved in politics before saying I Want every Republican sign you have a paper in front of my house\nAnd he went out to his truck to get them and people were stopping on the road saying you have science I Want those science 'cause I'm sick and tired of what's going on\nThe left has exposed themselves for what they stand for I've had to vote twice on the house floor to not impeach President Trump because Everytime Nancy Pelosi gets an opportunity she puts an impeachment bill on the floor\nSo let's just assume for a second that somehow Nancy Pelosi gets the gavel what is the game plan it's impeach the president it's single payer health care she's already said she'll make taxes higher bill defund the military and all the work on restricting the second Amendment rights\nI don't think that's where we want to go we can't go back to the failed policies of Obama we need to stand with President Trump move forward and continue to deliver results so that people can keep the the fruits of their labor\nLaw and my question to you know you had a Jim Messina who was the chief of staff to former Democrat Senator Max Baucus then he was a rock Obama's campaign manager and twenty twelve and on this whole Elizabeth Warren DNA testing he says I saw this\nThis is taking the Democrats off message heading into the twenty or Eighteen elections and I'm like what what message is that what message is there any way let's come back into the phone lines here Stephen ... you're on the congressman Greg gene for Dan Montana thoughts for\nFlorida Greg you're doing a great job it's a fake history ah there's only one way to keep a get a Democrat trashed November and on that account a got a question\nMaybe somebody give advice [noise] my uh my mail in ballot is almost finished but judicial candidates [noise] that's a rough one because\nNumber one there's no party affiliation and I have searched for hours and I\nCannot find any kind of record of a a\nFindings anything as a guideline show where these judges a stand on the issues are any advice [noise]\nWell I Would encourage you are often you can determine their positions based on who is standing with them so if a judicial appointee has a you can certainly check who has written them checks ah find out if the trial trial lawyers have backed them or not but it's usually not a badge of honor", "show_name":
