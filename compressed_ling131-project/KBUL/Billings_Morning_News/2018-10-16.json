can\nBring a camping chair if you got to pack a camel back something for water I'd set up a topic card if if I wanted to make some money out there but anyway um yeah\n'cause it's it's going to be at a a somewhat smaller venue I mean I I think I was seeing they might be able to to get back about five thousand or so people inside this hanger um 'cause it's going to be at the airport um now we previously reported that ... that the Trump rally was going to take place at six thirty Thursday night in Missoula\nAnd that it would be inside the the Neptune aviation hangar at the airport apparently that's the same hangar where Hillary Clinton a appear for a rally in Missoula back in two thousand eight so interesting aside bar\nA but here's the change here's the Franco for you the Franco is that that the rally is still going to be at the airport in Missoula but it's going to be at a different hangar now um apparently it's going to be at the minute manned aviation hangar or in Missoula big and here's why\nUh is is this is I think this is a cool feature this almost makes you I mean this is like a two for here\nUm because when when Trump came to to billings when the president landed in billings\nYou know if you wanted to see air force one you had to be up at the airport well if you were up at the airport you couldn't be down at the rally in getting inside already passing

Trump at the rally in Missoula see not only get to see President Trump\nYou also get to see air force one so that's kinda cool um but yeah apparently at Neptune ... you know the weight of of the aircraft of air force one\nUh the the you know the the the cement et cetera couldn't handle that weight but at a at a Neptune so there that's why they're going to have that many men so but it but again it's the it's the fact that they can only pack five thousand people in\nUm [noise] you know that's that's a lot of people because we're talking highly populated areas for Montana's standards

point five\nHi this is this story isn't just a Donald Trump Elizabeth Warren story I what I Love about this story is this is a Montana story through through and through so remember when President Trump was in great falls back on July fifth\nAh of course July six we had the audio for your right here on Montana talks a given you you know reaction and taking her phone calls and on and on and on as we always do but this was President Trump in great falls Montana uh back in July we will take that\nAnd say oh we have to do it gently\nBecause we're in the new generations to leverage on [noise]\nAnd we will very gently bad and we will slowly toss\nHoping it doesn't hit her in her arm\nThough it only weighs probably well [noise]\nAnd we will say I will give you a million dollars beverage Irn\nPaid for by to them if you take the test and the German\nOr they're you know that was President Trump great falls Montana back in July of course President Trump will be back in Montana\nThis Thursday in Missoula and boy I I Will almost guarantee you that he is going to say something about Elizabeth Warren\nAnd her whole DNA test that she started touting yesterday morning and boy it sure seems like that has blown up in her face any way here to talk about that story and more with those Rachel Sutherland from\nFox News radio joining us now on the phone lines Rachel always a pleasure to chat with you here on Montana talks a lot about Elizabeth Warren do you think she's regretting this move this morning\nIt doesn't appear so because she just tweeted something\nAnd not long ago response to President Trump is spin and waiting about her DNA test she challenged him or he challenged her actually to DNA test several times and it said at one point the he was\nGiven a million dollars to charity of her choice if she would do it or he is kind of blown off now in this questioning the results of the DNA test 'cause she some\nI don't know the results suggest it's like one one thousand percent of\nNative American heritage is blown up on social media and so he is calling her Pocahontas\nAgain saying the Cherokee Nation doesn't even want her Cherokee Nation did release a statement saying that the it was inappropriate for her to use the DNA tests to try to uh I don't try to prove this heritage or get in with the Cherokee Nation I don't think that's why she did I think she she wanted to have this inner filed for the twenty twenty\nPresidential campaign which obviously she's she's going to try to run and a lot of people are gonna start announcing right after the midterms are right after the new Congress the seat in January so anyway she is treated backing him or she is saying\nNice people watch the real Donald Trump 'cause you phone Bolden lied on your one million dollar pledge it took her handlers at the at this recycled races name calling you've lost a step in and Twenty one days you're going to lose Congress so\nHe's up there and I'm\nStill still fighting back she doesn't seem to be regretting the DNA test but I don't know how it's going to play for her I mean the Cherokee Nation steps that some of the people who may normally support unfair to warn may not like this is very much\nWell and if if the you know for claims are well but look this test\nProves that I have Native American ancestry I mean I think the the response has been pretty clear from people who are who know how these DNA tests work the pretty much anybody would have a trace of of Native American ancestry go on these DNA tests and in fact statistically the Daily Caller pointed this out that that depending on on the range here that\nShe actually could be whiter than the average\nWhite American here according to her neighbors\nI'm up in the eight o'clock hour or so

business a stew Varney has a good commentary piece posted at Fox Business a dot com and it\nBoils down to this America for first jobs to mobs as kind of in line with\nWith the line that I've been thinking summarizes there's these November elections here that we've really got it boils down to one line maybe and you can call in to if you if you if you've got one simple line that you think sums up these November elections or maybe you get a good\nYou know a lizard with Warren joke you know Elizabeth Warren is so white she blank you know feel free to call us with your lives with Warren jokes there's some really funny\nA means that are out there a right now uh you know\nIt it anyway there's there's one that's you know Elizabeth Warren maybe one one thousand twenty fourth a Native American on her DNA tests but Donald Trump is one thousand twenty four one thousand twenty force the president of the United states right now and that is not going to be intimidated\nBy some fake or like Elizabeth Warren that is for sure uh\nCould already see the ... the mainstream media the establishment media and their cheerleaders on the left a whining oh that why is why is Donald Trump talking about\nTalking about this why is he picking on her it's it's so on presidential you know what\nHay she is one of the leading United States senators who thinks she can be president and twenty twenty and she is one of the leaders of the resist movement\nUm she is the flag bearer the Democrat Party who was trying to block his agenda in the Senate so of course he is going to go after her he is trying to get jobs up and running in this country he is trying to get an agenda moving forward to move this country forward\nAnd if Elizabeth Warren is going to stand in the way of course he's going to call her out here uh you know\nUm you don't like it well that's that's partly why he got elected president because he's not just on the ... off you know he's not just doing the old school are there to distinguish cover Republican\nStraightening and getting those tiles affects all around so distinguished well good for you fight back\nStopped getting run over all the time that that's why Donald Trump won here um he's not going to be intimidated by some phony senator from Massachusetts or some phony Vietnam veteran from from Connecticut who's not a Vietnam veteran I mean come on here stolen valor\nElizabeth Warren claiming to be an American stolen valor Richard Blumenthal claiming to be a Vietnam veteran stolen valor\nAnd yet they still get elected in places like Massachusetts in Connecticut and I feel sorry for the minority voters in those states they get they get mobbed ruled by those people\nAre All right so I'm not that we have much to say and we've got John desperate are practically as liberal as Elizabeth Warren anyway uh currently representing Montana the United states but the point is\nAgain I think the difference the one line that sums up this November election is you've got one party that is the get stuff done party and then\nOther party which apparently is bound and determined to just be the make stuff up party um and so that's why I think what's do Varney has to say here so what what we've seen is you've got you've got one party the ... that they get stuff done party tax reform\nA record or this small business optimism that's out there the regulatory reform is to get stuff done part of it and even as the more simple than that\nLet's let's let's look at our own backyard here it's hey if Barry chalet got burned down in Glacier National park let's rebuild it hey if he if all these ranches were consumed by wildfires two summers ago well let's open up the CMRT grazing did just get stuff done it's the get stuff done party\nVersus the other side

Missoula somewhere out later this week we'll keep you posted on where that sets up so those are our listeners are on AM nine thirty cake NPT can come down and join us for the show\nA so we'll look for it I always look forward to getting out of the studio and getting back out on patrol in a and showing up in towns all across Montana so I'll look I'll look forward\nAdam hurts yeah thanks again for joining us here and and he'll join us in the first half of the show and then in the second half of the show will open up the phone lines to anything and everything you want to talk about but of course he he can cover pretty much any topic under the sun as well so if you want to call in and jumping on the conversation give us a ring at the two nine four zero nine Seventy [noise]\nUm yeah Adam when it comes down to the Senate race what what's the most important issue for you in particular\nYou know I mean I think um I don't agree with President Trump on everything but certainly you know what's been important to me is I think the tax cuts were a big one and of course the Democrats take control of Congress they'd lecture all those\nTax cuts back on Jon Tester voted against the tax cuts I think regulatory relief has been huge for a lot of our small businesses and if you look at job growth in the blue collar job growth is is through the roof\nI'm ... and that's just the result of the tax cuts the regulatory release a so those are two are issues that are important to me that I Know that Matt Rosendale stands with the president on those issues and and Jon Tester has opposed president on those shows\nAll right we've got callers on the line here as well let's go to Scott in Bozeman listening to fourteen to decay MS Scott how are you there\nYeah yeah you never know I'm not\nYou know the president's got to come to Bozeman too bad because it's a ... they're both college towns liberalism is ... and like thick Rosendale but that show up a lot and ah\nYou know they're they're gonna get beat if if he doesn't get he should be in Bozeman also and she worked at it and that's all I already called roses Dell's office heard nothing back but\nDid you did you make it down for vice president Pence when he was in Bozeman\nI didn't couldn't get it all yeah oh really okay\nI didn't go as when Trump was there and I was going to go see that um that was that was hard to get into too it's just it's tough to get tickets when you've got to work\nThat's true yeah I heard a lot a lot of those same about three ... they were saying hey you did in the middle of the day most most most of them has got to be working at that time so it's tough for people to make some of those daytime or at least the Missoula ones at night if you but if you can travel in time to make it therefore yeah I'm All right well I'm\nGoing to stay out of misery but not go to the\n[laughter] All right sounds good well Scott and you should be in a good mood right now because the bobcats have been playing well and the ... kind of been struggling a little bit there if you're a football fan I think that they can emerge you can kind of a identify with a with that struggle probably out\nHey yeah but things are getting better there on the upswing Bobby's back\n[laughter] I Know ah it's his first year back so I Know people were saying is first time and how many how many times that they've not been ranked in the top twenty five and his first year back so I'm sure some folks are giving them some time there are All right let's see we got another caller from Bozeman we got Joel on the line Joe your thoughts as more than\n... morning\nI got up on a related they're voting for character and a\nWhole bowl got pulled that phone close to your mouth around a little trouble hearing you there are ... not not\nFor him is that is used the same tactic of lies or give the person as they did care of you know or he did it again several Jackson says hey George Burns who writes about him is he just gave outfit quit\n... or so he is\nAnd then I'm relating to the end the Thirteen million dollars worth of ads that are just wherever you're fired or wherever\nAnd very ... here in true for most of those that are going to be truthful in running jak you know that there are not going to be true of whom were selling for ... for vote for\nUh and then\nHe's if people were not a not a radical like some of the other\nDemocrats are well radicals are charges that regret for\nYou know and I don't give a reporter for everybody else's grew the radical\nRunner and all of them are going for our long gone all end up very very weigh\nIn on yeah unfortunately things have become a team sport haven't day\nYeah All right\nWell you know you take a look at every mile of course we really haven't thought about this country before our gas goes for better or their issue but you're in a mob you've got a few leaders that are ...\nAre run run Rudolph ... versus a gang may not agree with how they're doing it but they're all going towards fame directors or ...\n... that's a very interesting analogy especially when you consider that\nAre in fact if I'm not mistaken our law enforcement friends would have to call in this but I if if I'm not mistaken ... don't they implement that concept into riot control training as you find the one who is\nWho is basically running the riot and trying to get the ... out of control and and if you are if you are able to to you know separate that person from the mob and from the riot\nThen you effectively Quil I'm violence from from breaking out things like that so that's a very interesting analogy Joel great to hear from you thanks for your phone call\nYou can jump in on the conversation as well to nine four zero nine Seventy\nA Adam hurts yet a jolt kind of talked about the animal Jackson thing and and how that plays into this well then you pile on the cabinet confirmation hearings at least the word elsewhere across the country is that the Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings\nA then great ideas from interior secretary Ryan Zinke heat Associated Press reported this story yesterday morning so yesterday we\nTold you how here's the idea so you've got a Washington governor Jay Inslee trying to block Montana coal\nOf from making it to market and we're talking about not not to some of the major coal companies trying to sell our products are overseas just like we would sell our farm products overseas just like we would sell other manufacture products overseas we're also trying to sell our coal ah overseas right\nUm but it's not just a major coal companies the benefit from that it's not just Montana revenues and taxpayers that benefit from that\nI'm at the ... tribe benefits heavily uh it gets a lot of their revenue from coal in coalmining so when Washington state is blocking these um cold terminals from being built\nTheir blocking crow colder blocking Montana jobs so it's a violation of not just the interstate commerce clause it's a violation of the Indian commerce clause as we've heard from our friends CJ steward who used to be on the\nA legislative counsel for the crow trap and so that is so clear violation what they're doing so what what secretary Zinke and the Trump Administration are trying to do is they're saying hey we're going to look at\nBuilding these coal shipping terminals on basically on on federal property so whether it's a military base or other federal lands on the on the coast\nIf we got to do it to to support these American Jobs in support\nSupport basically the fuel that powers our national security here in this country on our electric reliability then then that's what we're going to do right okay so that was the idea of well well guess what apparently now a Jay Inslee the governor of\nOf a Washington state he says that said quote hair brained idea has as its a hair brain idea okay well then okay then how 'bout you get off your butt and allow us to ship our products Jay Inslee\nNow of course there's a legal battle underway right now turn to general Tim Fox and several other agencies across the country suing Washington over this but we shouldn't have to fight\nTo get jobs up and running it shouldn't be that hard here in this country\nArt phone lines are open ... six to nine four zero nine Seventy or anything and everything you want to talk about but of course a election conversations all that dominating the the topics here especially as absentee ballots hit the mailbox is some of you if you didn't get it yet you will soon that is for sure [noise]\nUm but I Want to go back quickly to this Elizabeth Warren story so it was July fifth in great falls President Trump basically says okay Elizabeth Warren he's called her the fake Pocahontas Rush Limbaugh calls her full conscious\nThat because she's falsely claim that she has Native American ancestry and she tries to benefit off of that I considered like a case of stolen valor right and so so he says take a DNA test and if it proves you're Native American all all given a million dollars to the charity of your choice Elizabeth Warren's has ha ha\nOh I magically over the weekend took a DNA test and it proves that I Am a Native American ancestry\nI actually it doesn't the results show that statistically she is likely wider than the average white guy [laughter]\nAnd yet she thinks she's doing some sort of victory lap right now and it is comical or but you got to hear what Greg got filled had to say on the five on Fox News yesterday here you go\nPotentially one one thousand and twenty more Indian which is\nOn Fox News yesterday here you go\nShe's intentionally one one thousand and twenty fourth Indian which is zero point zero nine percent using such standards I'm Asian\nAnd which is why I Can't get into Harvard [laughter]\nSo no wonder he had to rely on sentiment and victimhood but it's really isn't about history but her story and fixing it 'cause it's a mess\nThen she or did she not list herself as a minority and law school director ... when it suited her than remove it when it did not about her background is about cheating she's a white woman a bath European ancestry\nAnd went to the buffet of identity politics into ... seconds then thirds warnings Native American because he said so she wins the twenty Eighteen Rachel does a little more\nSo if we all do the same test is hers and find similar percentages aren't we also eligible to claim the experiences of an oppressed group and their past grievances to her result now become the standard for anyone choosing a past that offers an edge skip ahead\nIn admissions more jobs in places where diversity drums experience\nIs not a bad idea affected your kids or maybe in high school age and they're applying for scholarships I you know I guess now just take a da de ... test and hey if they have just the tiniest trace of African heritage I guess they apply for scholarships as African Americans die I guess that's what we can do no\nWe'll call it the Elizabeth Warren method here anyway to it but what gym do did you hear what Jim Messina had to say so Jim Messina your primary Jim Messina was the chief of staff to former a Montana Democrat Senator Max Baucus and then of course Messina became\nA president Brock Obama's campaign manager in twenty twelve Jim Messina said diseases or\nArgue the substance all you want but why twenty two days before a crucial election why did Senator Warren has to do her announcement now why can't demographic ever stay focused ... to do in the face bomb\nOn behalf of his fellow Democrats here I don't know I was really a Jim uh what's your thinking right there\nAre a phone lines are open for over six to nine four zero nine Seventy the full story by the way posted at Montana talks a dot com All right let's go to Judy in Columbia falls listening to kj JR Judy good to hear from you what's your thoughts this morning\nThat sort of thing that worries me as a libertarian because Jon Tester is an office because we always run a third party\nAnd I just encourage people not to vote for him not that he's not a good guy I heard um during their speech or during the debate and it sounds good but now it's not the time to vote for him um Rosendale I Wish he had fought a little bit harder which advertisements take test your more to\nUm to pass but but he is a good guy and he would vote the way we want to with your libertarian or just Republican or independent or\nWhoever and then the other thing is you know with my ten it's always a native native Montanans well tested the native Montana and I'm from New Jersey I've been out here over forty years and he would have to be a perfect New Jersey senator that's where he stands that's where he is that's the way he\nPuts on this thing and I don't want my candidate looked like New Jersey so just because you're not from are born in Montana doesn't mean you don't have the best interests in Montana's\nUm heart I mean I Love Montana never moved back to New Jersey and I know I'm Matt rose I'm guessing\nBut he doesn't want Maryland or or my ... just because you're from ... does it make it a background\nWas interesting to um the Judy thanks for your phone call great to hear from it's interesting too that you talk about the libertarian candidate being on the ballot how come the Green Party candidate is on the ballot isn't isn't it kind of funny how funny it is it's actually quite um quite maddening isn't it quite funny how this all works out remember\nThe Green Party qualify for the ballot the Green Party candidates were also there was a Green Party candidate a legit Green Party candidate a ... Steve Kelly long long time you know Sierra Club type activist and a ...\nHe was supposed to be on the ballot but remember the Montana Democratic Party finally lawsuit to boot the Green Party off the ballot but they're more than happy to have a libertarian steal the votes from Republican but do no\nNo in the world would they allow a Green Party candidate to be on there to potentially take away votes from a Democrat isn't that interesting how that works out All right let's go to Gary in billings listening to news talk Ninety five point five nine Seventy K B. U. L. Gary good to hear from you\nThank you and thank you for taking my call\nI'm calling concerning the er the advertisements they increased rate filings that supposedly Rosendale has has allowed or has raised a actually if you look on the Web page for his office in in uh\nIt's actually states and this is under two thousand Eighteen rate filings\nAnd but it still applies insurance companies offering individual and small group health insurance plans are required to file for for proposed rates with in Montana state auditors department of insurance for review and before the plans can be sold consumers\nThe rate review process established by the Montana Legislature in two thousand Thirteen does not give the commissioner authority to disapprove rates or prevent them from taking effect\nIt does give the commissioner the chance to review that factors insurance companies use in setting rates if the commissioner finds the rate increase to be excessive or unjustified the insurer can voluntarily in lower the rate increase\nIf the insurer decides to use the rate increase any way\nCommissioner will issue a public finding announcing that the rate is unjustified\nSo what is it basically says as his lot powers limited in terms of rate increases\nYeah I mean I guess when he could have done it just\nNever allow those to happen at all by never you know basically reviewing and and and confirming those but then nobody would have had many people wouldn't have any any options of any plans to buy whatsoever but the point in the point you just made was the same point made", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Billings Morning News", "city": "Billings", "day": "16"}
