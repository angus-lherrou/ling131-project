all the words\nRender into some sentence\nWhy do they do the caption just to make sure you're a real person\nExactly so they know you're not a bond as it were\nWell have you with technology you know I'm I'm also fascinated I don't know if you looked at ... electronic do boys phenomena where\nThe whole chapter in the book about that person\nBecause it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes in clear just continually sweeps and again that that's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and others found sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick sparse moments as its scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with what they imagined as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is the exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex till eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think it was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was\nDoing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John de who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using a radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some needy and mystic device some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker where we're really trying to interact with\nOur technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers that have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our\n[laughter] that's true Peter ... with us whose latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology in London\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and and view it with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal of as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel\nUm who are being attacked or there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal of becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it\nIt there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep\nThat one of the stories that goal and grows so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them\nThe goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate man it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal um itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful ... story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal of them and the\nHe says to them well what can I Do tend to speak and they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures you're a man so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nYou know what about the Sherman says well you know you need a boa American tradition and other types of was a cultures ... seemed to be the Persian connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the state of consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nConnects us and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience said so I don't think that it's necessarily when we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in chanted we want to exist in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we have long been excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... stick sure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great adventure was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build a machine I don't think\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it wasn't you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists the rational\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk and because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want there to be the truth is this true Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his but she believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves\nAnd ... those are new Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy what do you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had two days equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you should have\nA you know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really wasn't as magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beep or golf his book strange frequencies we got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural to stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCaused insiders the new version of it goes to goes to a a map is no available Rawhide bone and know Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human quest to take control of our own\nSpiritual material ... I mean I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist one in particular max vapor used to talk about you know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right\nAnd I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practice magic for millennium right just another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nAnd I could we put you Peter in that category [noise] my\nThe one who who uses that tool and I\nWe put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah wow I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer that maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are like this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us\nAnd now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know if a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes or radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm On a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against\nAnd yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath it scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's\nWhat's underneath it and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can fix about technologies in ways that that the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you mentioned\nPeter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course who do never had a radio you never went on line like that listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or what my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to do the right kind of receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual as a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds and ...\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual as a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph\n[laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology and tell me why\n[noise] [noise] well I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah\nIt is the some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they\nThis is how they advertise their television this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true all my God so they they saw this thing this\nNew device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird but to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch you HFCs VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those dose right so even the way in which we\nThink about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this\nLanguage to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dumpsters has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yeah\nMy dad had an old silk all radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wood furniture and silver co written across it uh it ... it was it was a piece of art\nIn the same we TVs in the in the stereos others started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be center pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know\nI live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about this about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states\nAre and chanting states when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and told me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of\nArtificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers there's a movement of what's called trans humanism and host humanists\nAnybody that pays any attention to the media does it for the media is focusing on it and\nIn the last two and a half

a bias but\nUm I guess the cost and I wanted to get to those those of us in the audience that are of like mind is that is to use caution with the amount of emphasis that you put on trying to seek out\nThe guardian angel aspect and and I guess we get dangerously close to worshipping\nThe the angels in worshipping the people that God's putting our lives to help us\nI'm a father I've got a young

Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was the Hungarian born American illusion is stumped performer noted for\nHis sensational escape actually first attracted noticed some vaudeville and the U.S and that is Harry him ... on a tour of Europe where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up\nSunni extended his report to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape Roman hold his breath and ... sealed milk can with the water in it\nNinety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups commission by London's daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour and another ... buried alive only just able to claw himself to the surface or merge you know the state of near break down\nNow what many suspected that these ... were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge are fake spiritual is he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her he was not successful he told his wife bash\nThat when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back very Houdini died on October thirty first Halloween Nineteen twenty six in Detroit Michigan\nAll the bacteria comes out ran\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had took him seven days to die\nWho the substance is that what happened yes yeah it was a\n... so it saps assault through they had two operations and then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds or since before Nineteen Thirteen\nThey had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if one of them died that they would use this code contact each other\nAnd so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together confined to in this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to get to the medium trends what happens\nIf aren't there Ford was a trance medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory the you know the er which\nFrom arrived and she was was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a ... you\nKnow he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey all righty goes into the trench\nRight he just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later she doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses\nAnd in one of them he contacted Houdini some other about a year before this\nAnd then he starts having these sensors and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to\nA Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side one word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but Houdini was sharper than that who he said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one you're\nI Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him so this was an ingenious code\nFive words in French that she gets back that come back to him [noise] so this was an ingenious code really because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wow\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody knew what was going on\n[noise] well ah\nAs you know Harry had to be first\nFirst do skiing\nRight here with us Scott pollock just had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nYes he was not sure I heard\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game\nAbout that so uh\nAnd he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy um I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies\nUh in in the movie industry he invented that\nHe rushed cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was\nGoing to do was going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know with successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact didn't comfort professor Bess his wife\n... bass was in tough shape should best was pretty depressed but ... you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and\nShe uh\nWhile he was alive and asking died\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was arrested stock market yes\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like a grows on trees she just\nAnd I hear he left a nice little sum\n[noise] yeah he liked her a part of the uh they pay double a\nCondemn needy or whatever for his ah insurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money that\nRight ... probably that's close to a million dollars [noise] um so\nThey doubled that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched him and so it was the insurance company that came up and said\nAh that can happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got fifty thousand so she was little and then do\nNow and then she they put it all in the market and she laughed at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the Kurdish\nNow Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was magic the second part was the ... skates\nYou got a three part show the first part of the show was magic ... the second part was the ... a scape he would do an escape that was where the water\nOr Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have had this um confrontation with them lunch and\nSelf like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party he would go out to a palm reader at somebody or a a that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he'd go in and he'd find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark\nOr sometimes the I found it I\nGot you you know and\nAnd they're probably attached to a string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium to adjust my ah where do you do that I didn't have nothing to do with that\nWell they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you're calling out the way out\nYou work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next one and and it works so your shirt of success\nAnd so in his magic that's built in in the states of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there you know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T that's would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate tea in her mouth\nAnd just put it into his mouth exactly\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was exactly the same thing for the spiritual spiritual us because he had an agent and she would go into town and she would or find some low hanging fruit she would\nFind some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't find what they're doing and she couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini add a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere with a curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie he Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor we rent a break but we'll come right back and talk about the

R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one\nHere which they never\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] I'm like you know that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving the money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the ah the Scientific American has the same kinda thing going on so they're always going to Marjory he's saying on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em ... that's the agents that easily center had what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box and then he has um James Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in her hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get anything so who d'nese gotta make sure that she can't produce any\nTrickery so they uh do one ... and everything goes according to plan and ah they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the only I had the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now\nAh and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slacks so there's no way anyone could get at it well in the first sign of the bell rings so the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box he's going to stop it\nRight and they put ... and the second say on the bell rings\nSo now he's got a picture and remember we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her how he's you know exposed her so he's got this book he's going to put out so he has to expose her\nSo she comes in uh everybody gets around the sands\nAnd of course Marjorie has a spirit guide and his name is Walter and its Marjorie brother so Walter she can\nHave a spirit guide\nAnd his name is Walter and its Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nThis and this was just saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because inside the box is a ruler one of those rulers holds up into three pieces\nYup is one of those all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini and a James calling\nHow was the curse a professor and then we ended up dying\n[noise] well the ... acre stem and some people say that he said you'll die in a year a that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally that this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nDiet anymore\nYeah and really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nSick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor 'cause he doesn't\nHe doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini he outlive you all are she lived until Seventy one oh wow okay Arthur poured\nLived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the\nTable and then he had some drawings made her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing oh\nTrickery by Houdini\nYes so Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on ... he worked with Houdini he worked with done injure and then he worked with crafts can and he makes a statement of there's a a a bombshell in in the interview craft can\nAnd uh he gives this quote by Gibson it says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often as this honest as the mediums he purported\nTo expose while that's pretty heavy that as heavy coming\nFrom the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ... James Collins in there and that uh the rose Mac and bird was going ahead and\nThey were putting 'em yeah James Collins in there and that uh [noise] the roads Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done professor if they had television in those days\nA boy you would have been you

have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick and let's do this we can make this how did they do this same what's called puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly um James Collins when the guy that Houdini the bill to all of them for them but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walk you Nelson out everybody sees this thing lumbering ... and then they shrouded in clumps ... or something and

was a three part code or the code was middle section first word was rows and rows and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe\nAnd then she had dry words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his code I'd gotten through\nNow didn't he she later denied that later on or after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man called Edward Said comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nI fell in love again yeah yeah so he didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that it doesn't mean there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... promises to her\nThat she can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead [noise] uh what\nThan the cheat deny that uh the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct\nUh she says she was fooled\nBut she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages she's having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she ... she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math\nAnd oppression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with there every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh our before it was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing your just pleasure for that then Edward think comes in later promises or a million dollars and then

we had to deal with we were kids some of the stuff like that we deal with that kind of embarrassment but the old\nWe regardless regard was generous\nAtlas regardless generation and here we are you know and I was talking to one another about how we can become a anymore God was so we are now\nTalking about the bathroom and talking about the same amount of talking about the arch of bailed talking about as I go down the list of all the things that we do now\nWhich makes me kind of question you know ... ... where are our thoughts where are we turning returning to the dark side have to be\nI mean what are we we have a the strategic taxing going on with the which is in in New York and then father Gary Thomas was The Exorcist and accounting diocese in San jose California He's scheduled to masses\nPrior to the hacks against cabin on order to stop it and father Thomas told the national Catholic register quote that he has witnessed people in the same tank world becoming Boulder he said the more confident these so called St Louis become the more the general public will be more accepting of demonic\nNow Thomas said that this is not about free speech or religion it's about conjuring of evil he added that said tan and colds often commit crimes they murder they sexually abuse they they do everything like that to people in their cult\nSo we have to end it all with that of extra system that that topic Gary Thomas the guy who wrote the book the right about the rights also the movie the right was based on father Jerry Thomas we've had you'd probably Gary on the show before um you know and I don't think people understand\nHow\nI guess actually citizens one of those like an atom bombs or spirituality right the right of extra system\nWas first published in sixteen fourteen by pope Paul the fifth\nAnd the reason why they published it is because he was hoping to quell a trend of laypeople and praise for hastily performing extra systems on people they presumed repossessed and those included people who had to move on to play\nIn fact there's a line in the right and it said The Exorcist you should be careful to distinguish between demon possession and melancholy which was a catchall for mental illness so they're even from the beginning there was always that fine line that most priests had to walk with regard to exercise as a mental illness so the church knew back then\nThere were mental problems and and uh it said that The Exorcist should not have anything to do with medicine daily medicine to the doctors they should handle all of a spiritual stuff so you know a father and Gary is holding an actress is annoyed off witchcraft\nThen you know this is this is not some physical situation it's just something that's very spiritual that's just virtual warfare\nAnd so you know spiritual warfare I was told once that things like Armageddon and things like you know the apocalypse\nThey all begin on spiritual level the S. gets on begins on a spiritual level and then it happens to manifest itself in the physical and material world and so once his manifest in physical material world an old demons are unleashed all hell breaks loose\nAnd every extra shift is worth their weight becomes the army of God and they and they fight not just Catholic exercises but there are plenty of others to from\nVarious races are Jewish and and and Muslim extra sister born again evangelical charismatic religions that are due deliverance which of course bringing people from the throes of satanism or from the throes of demonic possession into the arms of Jesus or into the arms of God\nAnd that seems to be what people are looking for they're looking for some sort of\nI don't know they're looking for some sort of refuge they feel that they've lost their way they've lost their soles of their soldiers have been given up some guy caught my show last night and said that he gave us each soldier soldiers\nLost their way they've lost their souls shoals have been given up some guy called my show last night and said that he gave us each shoulder to shoulder the devil and I asked him why he and he told me that he gave his wife back to Jesus I don't know if that can happen\nBut I mean you know it's not up for me to decide that you know this other permitted to side with this guy to shoulder to shoulder the devil to give us so back to ... it's just crazy that many people when they're down you'll look like you said melancholy people who have melancholy\nIn fact a lot of be like I said last night and most of the nation's [laughter] you know they created the churches has definitely been friends for them to go on to practice their their their list if you're in a you know little ceremonies\nIt was the reformers that have changed everything\nFor good or bad I'm not going to say but I'm just saying it was reformers or change every everything has its roots\nBut a lot of the dark guards everything has its roots\nPre eastern magic in philosophies and it's from the Christian reformers in the end and the Christian Church that is tablets some of the other values and sometimes they embrace some of the pagan values\nAnd it's from the Christian reformers in the end and the Christian Church then established some of the other values and sometimes they embrace some of the page and values and so that's why sneaking up from behind this is the devil\n\nBut it's not necessarily the devil it's real it's the devil we make out to be a hallmark card of horns sharp tail and a little beer needs is basically riding his hands waiting for the next\nPerson that you can buy a soul from there so that somebody is telling them so it can take and basically manipulated I mean some guy was freaking out the other night about to lose the first show say they're giving glory elusive or by making a D. V. show that I Know they're not making losing her fictional character that makes him gory Dante did it\nIt doesn't do it by\nPutting it into practice is what does it putting it into practice doing bad things to your fellow man that's where you're putting into practice being a monster being a person who hates being a person who doesn't care about human life or beer too that's where you put yourself in the place of the devil that as a glorified the devil\nThat is what creates the atmosphere necessary for the idea of ... for the idea of casting spells curses or whatever you want to call them\n\nAnd we're at a time where it's easier to do it because people figure that it's going to help them to do something that would be considered blasphemous in order to make it work for them and then in the end they'll say oh I I decided to wash my hands of it all I sold my soul the devil but now that I've accepted Christ I think I'm gonna be okay\nI don't know if that works then again I'm not God and I don't make that decision\nBut still it's kind of weird it's awkward and I think things are starting to show themselves what they truly are\nSo that's why this Halloween and there's been this emphasis is not that I'm taking pride in this is this ... this emphasis because of the fact that almost every day is April Fools and every night is Halloween he'd just appears that way right now in the United states to go to Thomas in Illinois Hi Thomas you're on ground zero\nTo ... are you doing man hey I just wanted to start and say uh I really appreciate you appreciate the show and you talk about the topics that really need to reach out more and uh that's a wonderful thing I think you\n\nJust said a couple of versus further viable that I thought were hurting it and I'm\nThe first ones and as a fifty nine fourteen and says justice is turned back and righteousness fans far away for a truce has stumbled on the street lights just this can not enter his truth is lacking and he turns a site for the evil they so self uh pray and uh and it's a\nReally nice time there's a time was that was actually reading a passage today but you know\nVery good and uh so there's another one I'm sixty two because they ship the city guy yeah the channel that whoever kills you will think they're doing and got a service\nAnd that's what's been happening it's happening in the line is where the truth and flips and the majority they all they believe they're doing jobs surface ... not maybe the God of the fight over it\nAnd people are unprepared for some in the ... all those is a ... of God will will suffer persecution Sylvana gospel and all these topics you know it's it's happening so fast it's wrapping up it seems like China's going by faster and um it's it's a it's a permanent things the church\nI think it's important I think it's important to have\nKnow a spiritual idea of both sides in order to have it in your arsenal so the knowledge of good permeate throughout you put the knowledge of how bad operator out evil operates and when he has done to Clinton that evil that is I think very important and and that's why you know\nDid you how bad operator out evil operates and what he's done to Clinton that evil that is I think very important and and that's why you know you just you know talking to some people have a hard time talking about and they don't want to\nEven open up or entertain any conversation about the devil revealed the devil is going to jump through the radio strangled him to be the holy hell out of them well that doesn't happen what happens is that they're like I said a couple of days ago there was a rule there are rules that demons play by not all demons play by those rules\nBut most of the time the deal by certain rules and and and those rules when you break them the devil or demons or whatever it is is waiting for events spiritual entity that parasitic infiltration\nIs waiting to happen and when he does you know you're going to have to be prepared for how to get it out of you if it's like catching a cold it's like it's like catching a reoccurring cold or flu you know if you get at one time you know hopefully goes away you don't have to deal with sometimes those things linger and you have to do you know some harsher\nRemedies to get rid of it and I think that that when you're talking about exercises and when you're talking about possession\n... system is not just going and saying All right you're free that doesn't happen most dancers and take months most exercise is going to take forever and it's going to take a long time for us to exercise or at least try to purge from all of us this division and heat we're experiencing I think\nThat's right you know it says a as my people parents or lack of knowledge and I think that's the big one is the spiritual warfare that people don't even know they're fighting and I think it starts with pride people are caught up they're distracted by their own little trinkets so all the movies or football games in a you know they're distracted and\n... and Tom as soon as this thing I think people I think people should have entertainment I think people should have things that can can distract them for time it's not always I mean I'm not the kind of person is going to say hey you know you shouldn't do that 'cause it's distracting from the real thing\nPeople should take time for the real thing and it should take time for entertainment that you take time for reading and take time for enjoying a lot of fun ah activities\nOr we're not you know we don't want to walk around being pious idiots so we certainly want to be aware of what's going on around us we certainly want to be aware that does somebody who's a foot and we need to be able to defend ourselves when that stuff goes down and go to Dan in Virginia Hi Dan you're on ground zero hey\nThen yes the by man I've got a special little deal here with you there for you now I never told anybody about this and the guards to on a talk radio\nAnd I've got a special twist on there so the first thing I Want to mention it to you is that from men Nineteen eighty four clear on up to the almost the beginning of July ... eighty six\nI was in a spiritual battle with an extended family\nOf black which is and we're talking about grandmothers and grandfathers and everything clear on both sides and they were affiliated with the Tulsa mob and I tried to help rescue this woman from there I don't\nKnow what I did is I said at some energy which kept them so ... about how to attack me that I knew that they loved to argue amongst one another\nSo the more that I kept them ... done more that they are geared amongst one another\nAnd there are a whole group self destruct it just see\nSo are you what did you do put a ... when the cold water to Egypt words you say you're going to bed you\nWhat I did as I said there's possible options\nYou say you\nKnow what I did as I said at this possible options in other words I trick them into thinking that I'm showing them vulnerabilities on how to attack me\nBut I set it up so that these windows that they would perceive\nWouldn't make them so confused and overwhelmed by the different options that they could apply to attack me that they couldn't make up their mind and split it is to do\nAnd then what happened was they started arguing amongst themselves and then once I felt that vicious circle the argument all I did was speed it up\nAnd then that about it when it finally too cold and they took about a year I have to do it\nWhat happened was is the whole group self destruct it some of it\nActually went to Christ because I found out because I had my own spies and some of 'em just retreated damage to them in sales and so uh I I I've been there you know who you've done spiritual battle with which is so yeah\nAnd also see I also have known very wise or once they're done on magic myself and about Ninety nine percent\nOf all kinds of practices along those lines deals with self knowledge and protection against aspects of yourself\nNinety nine percent of it has to do with that it doesn't have anything to do with a uh doing things upon others 'cause you have to take care of yourself first\nOkay yeah so it makes your your your well would you sell your right within your somebody's drunk or taking on which is I got to\nRush Limbaugh we used to in a new one the um on

I think\nIf I Would have gone I Would also be quite\nWell it'd be a oh okay\nI Would go into hiding too I mean imagine what you've been through this is three months of gay three months of dealing with\nLike you said a a young boy who you know swears in Latin speaks in Latin to the breeze ... they tried to hold him and he said there were I Can't remember how many brother and he said we see thirty if I remember in the interview the thirty men gloom and bring him down how many said\nBut there were six people by the by them at the same I mean they they were they were fasting praying and doing all say you know that this was a it was a big ordeal\nRight out there that there's a statue there in that hospitals that was given to them after this was all that I mean it was it was a locally very ... very well known local things ...\nAnd um and there there were several saying is that hospitals saying let's say hospitals I'll write and it has when you when you walk in there it has a lot of this stuff that you know of of thought that ah the extra says them and that kinda stuff\nI'm kind of they\nThey talk about it you know it's it's all there on the on the walls it's an interesting interesting thing is okay but\nOne thing one thing that I didn't hear the interview maybe you can give me some clarity here now when the boy was in Maryland this is when he first had the possession was in Maryland and then he moved to St Louis wasn't there the story that one of the priests who attempted to exercise room in the beginning in Maryland we had all the wrong or you had a stroke that writing to broke his arm or when oh okay\nSo it'd be broke his arm or the the boy and a twelve year old boy was a it was a um a Protestant and um he he uh\nThey've got they've the minister try to exercise them and the kid over power to focus on site and the ah\nThe kids and the mother's sister was going to school at St Louis universally our city in England and ah she went and talked to her and structures that some of the Jesuits\nAbout him and that's where the Jesuits became evolved\n... and he was ... he was Lutheran from what I understand the ...\nLutheran yeah the family converted to Catholicism [laughter] yeah I Would\nToo anyway my boy was invested in one day he comes out in the hospital these these perfect these fine you know after that\nYeah yeah that was it and and that's what he said at the end you know the kid was just like a formal twelve year old boy\nYeah that's what he said them twelve year old and\nIt was it was a it was very interesting to listen to but I you know I I thought that it would go for it and to get that message there'll be being a nurse for many years is I have and and working in hospice and everything else ... you know you you kind of get ad\nOr an idea of you know your ... until I Want it to make sure that this story got out in first hand first hand something foreign\nGrey oh you you you you let us be the show to do it because I think that a lot of people for a long time I mean there've been many I'm sure like I've heard stories of\nYou know other radio shows that have you know it dealt with this subject talking about the the real live exercises in Berlin do but I don't think anyone who's ever produced a the eyewitness accounts from a nurse was there a brother Grider who smoke I think the exclusivity of your\nInterview in the in the fact that you even were able to get it after he made his silence I think is is a remarkable and it's in it's awesome about it's awesome you did that\n[noise] yeah you know I I've tried several times to get it out over the last ten years you know in in many different ways and something always comes up um and then yesterday a when I was called by you guys I thought okay here close again but [laughter] yeah luckily you know\nOh is this a lot of interest because I Know that I think a free can actually didn't know a movie with a father a more ah regarding his actresses and\nAnd uh he still a guy who directed the extra says\nHe's still fascinated by this because I think I think the film are convinced him there's more uh to\nReligion in the supernatural than than than he didn't he didn't understand and realize and then he he wanted not to do a fictional account of a real extras as me want to do a real actresses and we wanted to be there with the cameras during a real actresses and show people but\nYes evil is real the devils reliving Kenyan range of people are in into the boy is you know he depicted in the film but having the real case you know there are for everybody to see is kind of the same thing you did when you really reform would brother Grider had to say ah because I think people still have an interest in this and we want to know the truth\nA behind the story that happened in Nineteen forty nine\nThere are very few actresses and that actually have manifests themselves the way that that's what it it it's one in several hundred it have any kind of you know I'm extra normal or upset that fits with it but to have\nAs much and that's why there was a case study done on this um [noise] and uh the the election brothers have what a case to the original case

amazing some of the stuff that you've sent and all the things I read or\nJust ... you know here's a question that uh I I I mean you suddenly when you clarify for me and a lot of people\nDon't notice so when these things started happening Roland or are a number of his aunts and uncles in some priests were aware of this they were before the extra says that might be to a Lutheran ministers slept with the boy they slept in his bedroom to try and figure out what was going on\nAnd then uh there were a Catholic ... a non Catholic and an uncle bunch of relatives who were present\nAnd they made a major shift at ... am I getting this correctly where\nThey put a plate on the table and it moved from letter to letter to explain who the demon or what the demon was is that true\nBased on the information that I found in the document they don't they don't really reference that specifically are so I've heard I've heard different accounts that yes there there was you know that the ants ... enjoy using that we'd be bored\nDifferent accounts that yes there there was a you know that the ants ... enjoyed using that we'd be bored I'm you know it was an article and um but in the document and the PDF just referenced I'm I'm not aware and there wasn't any reference from what I've seen to the actual use of the ...\nAnd when I was it a week or per se they were actually this is what I read\nFrom the the documents that they actually use quote un\nAlphabetical medium on porcelain kitchen table litters of the alphabet were written on paper were underlined whenever the table moved or wherever the ... moved on the table\nAnd a coded messages remember this is similar to what was done except without the Christmas lights on stranger things actually\nAre and the phenomena indicated that it wasn't the devil now ... said that it was the soul of\nThe deceased and then there's it's it's redacted who do they figure out what was the spirit was investing the boy\nYes and and\nYou do mention that there was some documentation and they did right to the letters down as well when I misunderstood and you know about the ... that we\nOnly dated hobby it's kind of a makeshift we did it and that's what I said makeshift\nWe ... yeah yeah and um so I think they suspected because they were trying to I I think they were really hoping that it would be the ant and then you know essentially from you know conduct ... you know asking questions um they did receive confirmation that enough it was the ant\nBut they were being deceived um and um you know ultimately it was the dean and and and that there are references to the the devil um itself as well you know as you get further into the document\nSo again this is like in the movie The Exorcist ... were first\nA father terrorists ah his mother was in the body of Reagan in ... and remember de me don't do this to be deemed me\nThe other spirits were speaking him he says you're not my mother you're not in there with my mother this is all a deception so probably that's where they got the idea that ah what was going on is that they probably thought the aunt was in it was possessing the child\nAnd then eventually they were deceived and found that it truly was a demon that was with us human child\nYeah yes and um and then they were\nUm and the ... the father does a really great job or of a documentary and um then the messages on that were initially you know from recording you know given the background with respect to what the family recorded but then a demographic that's clear on\nA farm in the ... says I'm and and even actually um preceding\nTheir their travels to St Louis um they felt they were noticing that there were you know red marks and and riding appearing on his skin on and um one one of the the word was Louis so they felt that that you know that they would eventually we're supposed\nTo go they saw it as a sign initially that what they should go to St Louis and um and then contact the Jesuit order and and the priest stare for help so um so it it's you know very deceptive and um you know and then as as it progressed says I you know the\nThe word gets sinister and and I'm more and more evil and and

I Can't even said demography is that when they call it\n... demographically are during the dirty laundry we yeah go ahead ... just you know just\nThe the writing on the skin and again and\nOne important point is you know some a suspect a while the um you know that it may be um\nThe child had had written and you know as as a rule is um but the witnesses again the family were there there were ... priests there and they would appear without and being anywhere near a they get out a touching that part of his body and also um there were they were on the parts of the body that could possibly tie\nYou know this day and prints from I understand it is and and I don't want to get too graphic but I guess you know we're on late night radio and if you're listening this program so far you know we're dealing with\nWe're dealing with demons we're dealing with how they were they rack and tear up the human body and how most of the priests were involved here aged quite a bit when they were working on this and trying to get this boy back to normal one of the things I've heard as it was so bad they had to\nBasically hog tied him to the bad and and they had to keep him from levitating and the problem was that the the demon whatever it was would spell\nAnd and they had to keep him from levitating and the problem was that the the demon whatever it was would spell on whose body things like a dabble in hell and a lot of the sack religious references to Jesus Christ\nAnd at the time they were done the priest would say\nWe command Christ with\nChrist command you or we command the devil demon name your name yourself and leave the body of the boy and every time the demon would speak to them and Latin and then with the move doing them and and and you know we're lucky you always saw was the soup and The Exorcist before and I understand the boy would definitely Kate and urinate all over the priests city\nIt was it wasn't you know the you know taking a a you know regular like projectiles what it was so you know they they eliminated the gross is of that\nAnd and replaced it with vomiting or in the movie but the truth was is the other the demon would literally said to them that are you there he's going to leave the body of the boy and every time you did it the boy what do you earn eight or are you a decade on the ... and so they were covered in in in all of that while they were doing the exercises\n[noise] well and if you don't mind that I share quickly or\nJust from the from the journal when first of all I I Do want to clarify that the um ... veil on line and um so uh it's open it's you know they live up to the public and I will share I Can't say that you know it's it's my you know my document or to get out um or any of that means so\nRight you know from my standpoint I certainly you know please to share it but again\nI have a library that we are developing a library of of of files and we're going to now people why we're developing a library of files and I just want to make sure that I could use that as the ... the link in our library of files so people can do the research if they wish to and that's how I was asking\nIs certainly certainly and and and you know from my standpoint yes most definitely but I just wanted to clarify that and if you don't mind the reading quickly just from the the journal just said the most distinct markings on the body with a picture of the devil on ours right leg and the word hell imprinted on our chest and such a way that our\nCould look down upon his truck to read the letters plainly so it was horrific for\nYou know for for Roland is experiencing this but if I could just quickly add it just said that um there were also you know the arrows pointing down towards you know his his male part in it and they said that\nThey feel that um\nAnd further answers to the prayer because they would you know constantly prayer there were two letters go and the third pointed away from the crotch an indication that might have meant that the devil would leave by way of urine nation or ... though it just shows you know the level of horror and and um [noise] and uh\nThat you know this poor boy you know\nUnder went and then also the poor family that's that's you know it it at this point in time I don't believe they were there they were already in the um they waste from the house\nTo actually the college church um there was a ... on campus so I saw the sales university campus they actually did perform some part of the ex over there as well you know um and that's a little known fact but\nHere that ... ... is another thing\nA John Grider had said that one of the things was most terrifying was him constantly sounding like when he woodpecker he would click his tongue and he would laugh like woody woodpeckers so we'd go [laughter] any laugh like that and it was so bizarre because they said it was perfect\nAnd it sounded like it was a it was it was a just to see panic\nA woody woodpeckers laughter but what was interesting is he is that there was a time where a a he doubled over a and they woke up crying and he says my throat hurts my throat hurts in the end\nIm where a a he doubled over time and they woke up crying\nAnd he says my throat hurts my throat hurts in the end you know when the new for\nThe boy and then as soon as he said my throat hurts all of a sudden his voice cleared and they heard him sing or harm or la la la ... the blue Dan you send and then of course he's saying the old rugged cross\nAnd I heard I even heard from 'em what someone else um\nI I think it was actually mark telling me that he also saying he also said there's some old man river\nAnd what was funny is that he was performing these songs and and as he performed them the priest felt like oh well obviously you know nothing evil could do this you know they're they're getting closer closer closer\nAnd then as soon as um as soon as they got closer to the see the boy was okay it happened again that the boy would you know release everything out to them\nAnd and the and he would say to them you know in Latin some horrible thing about the preached about the priest or father you didn't bother you know and so all the stuff we saw the movie The Exorcist was nothing compared to what was going on without boy you lose ...\nWell yes and actually he broke father Halloran no Senate referenced and the PDF and um so they are many any hit another um\nAnother father that was there um and then those law and cause at the bleeding severely but he actually broke\nFather Halloran snow son and he's\nHe's the I I feel more connected even though I never really had an official relationship with him or anything never really knew him but you know just seeing them around campus and just knowing you know just knowing you know seeing them interact you know a ... a a couple of times that I did I just a very serious man and and um again just really\nHorrific but he didn't really talk about it but just to know that that was documented in there and um\nThen the other thing if I may add quickly that I Do want to share um during my time of the archives um there was a professor that would come in and they had a a an old middle aged a manuscript collection so you know they they collected so the a professor of going to the archives and do his research while he he knew father\nHalloran quite well and um he shared a story that there is that\nThere was always a sense of dread and foreboding when he would uh prepare to go to the election brother's hospital to assist father about arms\nAnd um it was just that I live in a negative like forest or energy that you know just a feeling of ... one time he just sit back and at that time they had street cars and he took the ... to the electric brother's hospital stopped and was about to exit the streetcar when he put his foot from the street car down to\nThat set foot on the ground a force stopped him\nHis stop to it in that air and he could not he could not placed down so and he said a prayer and then it released and he was able to you know put it down planets split into scope carry on you know it's just sitting in the ... that was you know that's not first canceled father Halloran but it was from a very trusted source that\nYou know that I got a new during my time there and and I trust I mean these are honest honest people and um you know again but it was just a story that just as always fascinated me and I'm just pleased to be able to share that\nWant to read an excerpt from is going to the phones at midnight the father's
